I understand most people in New Jersey don’t need a living trust because probate is simple in the state, but can having a living trust save you time or money?

— Planning

A. Thank you for your question.

While probate avoidance is often touted as a reason to have a living trust, generally speaking, many people who have living trusts also have what are called “pour over wills,” said Shirley Whitenack, an estate planning attorney with Schenck, Price, Smith & King in Florham Park.

“This is because people often have assets that they have not placed into a living trust such as tangible personal property such as furniture and household furnishings, a car, and/or a small bank account,” she said.

Plus, it may be necessary to open an estate because of unclaimed funds held by the state, a tax refund or return of insurance premiums, she said.

“Pour over wills generally provide that the estate assets will `pour into’ the living trust upon the death of the person who created the living trust,” she said.

Living trusts have the advantages of privacy and the elimination of challenges to the estate, Whitenack said. Such trusts can also be used to segregate assets acquired before a marriage and as a vehicle to manage the assets of a person with diminished or lack of capacity.

“While financial institutions can freeze up to half of the assets in an estate until a tax waiver is obtained, tax waivers are not required to transfer legal ownership of trust assets following the death of the person who created the trust and therefore, financial institutions cannot similarly freeze up to half of the assets in a trust for that reason,” she said.

But there can also be disadvantages to creating a living trust.

“The cost of creating a revocable living trust and a pour over will is generally greater than the cost of preparing a will only,” she said. “In addition, there may be costs associated with transferring assets such as real property into a living trust.”

The legal fees incurred in administering an estate may be greater than legal fees incurred in administering a trust after the death of the trust maker, Whitenack said

Furthermore, the time it takes to settle an estate may be longer than the time to distribute trust assets because it may take several weeks to probate a will and obtain a tax waiver, she said.

“However, if the person has relatively few assets that would be subject to probate, the cost of establishing a living trust may be more costly than administering an estate,” she said.

But according to Simms, the story didn’t have to end there.

Per the Boston Globe, “Simms revealed that he nearly came out of a one-year hiatus in 1995 to play quarterback for (Bill) Belichick’s (Cleveland) Browns.”

“When I got cut by the Giants, after a really good year [in 1993], going to the playoffs, winning a playoff game, being an All-Pro quarterback [he was Pro Bowl, not All-Pro], it caught me off-guard,” he said. “My thought process, really for my whole life, was that I was going to coach [when I was done playing]. I kind of regret that at times. I wish I had tried it. My wife sometimes says to me, ‘You should have coached.’ And I say, ‘Yeah, and I’ve been fired three times by now and I’d be even more bitter than I am.’ ""

After the Giants cut him, he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to go into coaching then or try to play again. So he took the opportunity to spend the ’94 season as an analyst at ESPN. “Had a lot of fun there, liked it a lot,” he said. “But when it was over, I still thought about playing, and then venturing into coaching. That [opportunity to play again] was actually with the Cleveland Browns, with Bill Belichick. It didn’t work out, so I said that was it. That’s when I said I’d stick with this TV thing.”

Belichick was the Giants defensive coordinator for their first two Super Bowl titles, so he and Simms were well-acquainted with one another. After the 1990 season, Belichick left the Giants to become the Browns head coach. He went 36-44 in five seasons with Cleveland before reuniting with former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, who was running the New England Patriots at that point. After following Parcells to the New York Jets, Belichick returned to the Patriots in 2000 to begin his second stint as a head coach. And all he’s done in New England is build a Hall-of-Fame resume by winning the Super Bowl six more times.

How much is too much when it comes to trading for disgruntled Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson?

And if Watson is too rich for his blood, what does Douglas do at quarterback? Does he stick with Sam Darnold, or does he go all-in on rebooting the team by selecting a quarterback with the No. 2 pick overall in the 2021 NFL Draft?

The Jacksonville Jaguars are expected to pick Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence at No. 1., leaving Ohio State’s Justin Fields and BYU’s Zach Wilson as the top quarterbacks on the board for the Jets.

According to ESPN’s Rich Cimini, the choice is a no-brainer for draft guru Mel Kiper Jr.

If the Jets don’t get Watson, they can stick with Darnold or draft a quarterback at No. 2. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. isn’t a fan of the latter route and would opt for Darnold. “I would do it with Watson; I wouldn’t do it with a young quarterback,” Kiper said by phone. “I wouldn’t draft a Zach Wilson or a Justin Fields this year at the 2 [spot]. I wouldn’t do that.” Kiper rates Wilson and Fields as first-round talents but not on the elite level. And, we have more than two months to continue this debate.

In his first mock draft, which was released last month, Kiper projects the Jets to stick with Darnold for at least one more season and give him a valuable weapon — Alabama wide receiver and Heisman Trophy winner DeVonta Smith — with the second overall pick.

I dated a guy I’ll call Ken for six months, but things went south because it felt weird. My question is, is it normal for a 57-year-old man to still be living with his mom?

Abby, Ken’s mom said bad things in front of me. She told her son that if he’s going to have sex with me, he might as well live with me. (We never had sex.) Another time she didn’t want me to wear shorts, hold Ken’s hand or even sit with him at their house. Why? Do I need help? -- YOUNG-ISH WIDOW IN ILLINOIS

DEAR WIDOW: A single man living with his mom is unusual, but not necessarily abnormal. Ken’s mother’s behavior, however, was not normal or acceptable. The extent to which this man’s mother controls his dating life is over the top.

Apparently, she perceives you as a threat, and she doesn’t want to “lose” her 57-year-old son. You don’t need help; SHE does. So does Ken, who appears to be her hostage. The tie that binds him to her may be emotional or financial, or those apron strings would have been severed decades ago.

DEAR ABBY: My friend and I are planning a road trip. We live in different parts of the country, so he’ll be flying to my city, where we will start the trip. We plan to split the cost of car rental, gas and hotels. However, I was assuming that he would pay his own airfare, and he was assuming that we would split it like everything else.

What’s normal in situations like this? Is it normal to pay one’s own airfare and expect costs to even out in the future when the other person flies to you? Or is it normal to split the cost each time? The road trip isn’t at risk because of this, but I want to set the right precedent for future vacations we take together. -- ROAD TRIPPING IN IOWA

DEAR ROAD TRIPPING: This is something you need to discuss further with your friend. Do you consider his getting there a part of your shared vacation, or do you feel your responsibility begins when he arrives? There are no hard-and-fast rules about this, and frankly, I think it depends upon your financial situations.

DEAR ABBY: My husband passed away unexpectedly. It was and is a tremendous loss to my two daughters and to me.

While writing my thank-you cards to individuals who attended his viewing and church service, I noticed someone had written “Mick Jagger” as attending his viewing and “Rod Stewart” as attending his church service. I was floored and deeply hurt when I realized the handwriting belonged to one of our pallbearers -- my husband’s sister’s husband. Our teenage daughters also saw it and told me they thought it was disrespectful.

I don’t know if I should tell my sister-in-law or let it go. I want to ask him why he would do such a thing. Or am I overreacting? -- HURT IN TEXAS

DEAR HURT: No, you are not overreacting. What your brother-in-law did was, to put it mildly, insensitive. A funeral memorial book is the wrong place to attempt a bad joke. By all means tell your sister-in-law about it. And when you do, be sure to mention how it affected you and your daughters. You all deserve an apology for his inappropriate behavior.

It’s Brady’s fourth Super Bowl title in the last seven years (Super Bowls XLIX, LI and LIII with the New England Patriots).

At 43, Brady is the oldest player to win a Super Bowl, breaking the record set by Brady two years ago, when he and the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3.

And this time he did it the hard way. His first six Super Bowls all came with the Patriots heading into the playoffs as a division champion, guaranteeing at least one postseason game was played in New England.

My daughter includes Gail in the daily household activities, including holidays and birthdays. The children have pictures of their mom (Hank’s late wife) hung up in their home and speak often about her.

Gail is not very nice to my daughter. She purposely calls her the wrong name. She says she does this because my daughter’s name reminds her of her daughter.

Gail has done other things -- such as pull the children out of school after being told not to. She has taken them to doctors and dentists for appointments without talking to my daughter or their father. She has been asked to back off some. My daughter understands that Gail jumped in and helped for a year and that it might be difficult for her to turn over these responsibilities, so she has been patient with Gail. But they have been together for 18 months now and live together as a family.

The issue is that my daughter decided not to invite Gail to the wedding. This is intended to be a special day about the bride and groom. My daughter was concerned that Gail might speak ill of her to other guests, as has happened on other occasions. The invitations were sent out, and Gail immediately wanted to know where hers was. My daughter explained, as nicely as possible, that she was not invited. My daughter was immediately met with mean, hateful comments.

Gail then called the grandkids’ paternal grandmother -- Hank’s mom -- and complained to her for 40 minutes.

The wedding had to be rescheduled due to COVID-19, and the delay has put the issue back to square one. Gail has started all over, assuming she will get an invitation. Is my daughter wrong to exclude her? -- Wedding Drama

Annie Lane writes the Dear Annie advice column.

Dear Wedding Drama: If you have to ask the question, you probably know the answer. Yes, it is wrong for your daughter not to invite the grandmother of her stepchildren to the wedding. Your daughter is not starting fresh with Hank; she’s marrying a man who comes with a family that suffered a tragedy. While Gail’s behavior does sound a bit intrusive, try to remember where she is coming from. She lost her daughter. She is probably devastated, and her daughter’s children are going to be another woman’s stepchildren. Try to show compassion for Gail. You and your daughter don’t have to love her, but you certainly have to learn to be kind and gracious to her. She should continue to be a part of your stepchildren’s lives -- hopefully forever -- and I think it is up to your daughter and Hank to facilitate that.

As far as the negative talk about your daughter, no one needs that at their wedding. Your daughter and Hank should have a very direct conversation with Gail, explaining that they will not tolerate drama on their special day and that she is invited only on the condition that she meet their kindness with kindness.

Bernie Sanders, who as the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee will shape the final $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill, said Sunday the $1,400 direct payments should go to Americans making $75,000 or less.

Sanders, I-Vt., rejected proposals to restrict the full payments to those making $50,000, which was part of a plan to prevent wealthier taxpayers from getting a share of the money. Under the original proposal, checks could flow to families earning $300,000 or more.

“When people said, we don’t want rich people to get that benefit, I understand that,” Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And what we need to do is have a strong cliff, so it doesn’t kind of spill over to people making $300,000.

“But to say to a worker in Vermont or California or anyplace else that, if you’re making $52,000 a year, you are too rich to get this help, the full benefit, I think that that’s absurd.”

Sanders said the thresholds should be $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples, just as they have been in the first two rounds of stimulus checks signed into law by President Donald Trump. Those making less than $100,000 and couples making less than $200,000 got smaller payments based on income.

“It’s also, from a political point of view, a little bit absurd that you would have, under Trump, these folks getting the benefit, but, under [President Joe] Biden, who is fighting hard for the working class of this country, they would not get that full benefit,” Sanders said.

“From a political point of view, it is absurd to be telling working-class people, somebody who has a decent union job, they’re making $55,000, $60,000, sorry, you’re not eligible for the program. It makes no sense to me at all, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people.”

Congress last week passed a budget resolution to trigger a parliamentary maneuver known as reconciliation, which would prevent a Senate filibuster and allow Democrats to pass the stimulus bill without any Republican votes.

While Biden has talked about working with Republicans on the bill, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, said that wasn’t the case, citing the president’s rejection of the alternative $618 billion spending package proposed by him and nine other Senate Republicans as too small.

“The administration is showing very clearly they don’t care if they have to work with us,” Cassidy said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “We come in good faith with at least 10 and more that would have joined us, and they say they don’t care. So, you got that. It takes two to tango. Right now, I’m not sure we have the two to tango.”

Senate Republicans have noted that the previous stimulus bills were passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. But that came only after GOP senators tried and failed to pass their own bills without any Democratic priorities, demanded that any legislation protect businesses from lawsuits if employees or customers were infected by COVID-19 and increase taxpayer subsidies for religious and other private schools. Republicans also did not negotiate with congressional Democrats after the House approved two trillion-dollar stimulus measures.

Biden and other Democrats have insisted on the larger number, noting that a too-small stimulus package in 2009, purposely kept lower to attract Republican support, hindered the nation’s economic recovery from the Great Recession.

Lawrence Summers, who was treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, suggested that the $1.9 trillion package could set off “inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.” New Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on CNN responded that his concern about inflation needed to take a back seat to worries about not spending enough money to fix the economy.

“My predecessor has indicated that there’s a chance that this will cause inflation to rise. And that’s also a risk that we have to consider,” Yellen said. “And I can tell you, we have the tools to deal with that risk if it materializes. But we face a huge economic challenge here and tremendous suffering in the country. We have got to address that. That’s the biggest risk.”

Recent studies by S&P Global and the Brookings Institution said a $1.9 trillion package would return the economy later this year to what it was before the pandemic. And Moody’s Analytics said the plan would help create 7.5 million jobs this year and another 2.5 million next year, fully recovering all the jobs lost due to the coronavirus.

The Republican alternative also left out Biden’s proposal for $350 billion in federal aid to help state and local governments pay the salaries of first responders, teachers and other public employees. That has been a top Democratic priority.

Cassidy, who last year joined with New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez on bipartisan legislation to provide such aid, said on NBC that there was less support for the assistance this time around, considering New Jersey’s loss of revenue was just 0.5%, New York’s was 1.5% and the average drop was 0.1%.

“It’s hard to build political consensus when there’s only 0.1% revenue decline,” Cassidy said. “Some folks are going to scratch their head and say, ‘That’s not justified. Let’s think of a different way to do it.’”

Show Caption Hide Caption Mel Tucker on Michigan State football 2021 recruiting class, transfers Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker added 3-star WR Keon Coleman on Feb. 3, bringing his 2021 class to 19 players along with five transfers. Michigan State athletics

Hamp Fay and Kameron Allen connected before they even arrived at Michigan State.

The two Texas high school football stars live less than an hour from each other, so they would meet up together during the COVID-19 shutdowns this spring and summer. Fay, a quarterback, would throw to Allen, a tight end, with visions of taking that work to East Lansing in January.

Now, the early enrolled freshmen live just down the hallway on campus, going through the Spartans’ winter conditioning and getting to work on their timing inside MSU’s indoor practice facility.

“We both work out together,” Fay said Wednesday. “We're part of the same lifting group, so we're at the same rack. We spend a lot of time just motivating each other.”

Fay got to see MSU and meet Mel Tucker and the new coaching staff last winter before the COVID-19 shutdown of college sports and recruiting. Allen did not make an official visit, committing to Tucker in April four days after his future quarterback.

Allen had not even met his head coach in person until he arrived last month.

“It was kind of different. It definitely impacted recruiting,” Allen said. “I started getting recruited by Michigan State in March, and that was right at the COVID breakout — that's when all the things really got closed. At this point, we didn't know how long it was going to be closed. ...

“You can't BS with anybody that you want to go to because the opportunity can close just like that. I knew that I wanted to go to Michigan State, that's where I wanted to be, so I wasn't going to waste any time trying to hold out for any offers or see if I can get on campus or any of that. I knew that was where I wanted to be.”

Tucker so far has assembled a 19-player traditional recruiting class plus a six-player haul from the NCAA’s portal. Fay and Allen are among the four high school and five transfers who are working out and preparing for Tucker’s first Spartans spring practice, which was wiped out last March by the pandemic that arrived a month after his hiring.

“We're in a dead period in recruiting, so we can't host recruits on campus, we can't leave campus to recruit,” Tucker said Wednesday. “Some of these guys, when they reported midyear and they checked into the dorms, when I met them, that was the first time I met them face to face.

“It's a challenge to recruit during this COVID time now.”

Fay said the timing of his visit last March, days before the pandemic led to the NCAA closing down in-person recruiting, became “a blessing from God.”

“With the whole COVID and the virtual thing, it is definitely unfortunate that a lot of players haven't been able to go on visits and stuff,” Fay said. “I think that does play a really big part, because you want to see what it feels like... the people, you wanna see the facilities. I was able to see that. Some of the other commits and signees will ask me, 'Hey, what did you think of this or that?' And I can give them an honest opinion and saying, 'Hey man, the facilities are unbelievable. It's everything you ever need.’”

Neither Fay nor Allen were prepared for the snow and cold when they arrived last month, each saying getting used to a mid-Michigan January was the biggest adjustment. But Allen’s arrival also made him realize the distance that is now between him and his family back in Forney, Texas.

“It probably hit me the moment my parents said goodbye and they were going back,” Allen said. “That was probably the moment it hit me that I'm out here on my own, and I have to be responsible and do what I need to do in order... to be able to come back.”

Tucker said enrolling early for Fay, Allen and safety Michael Gravely Jr. from Cleveland will help them “get a leg up” on their classmates who will arrive this summer and fall. The fourth midyear freshman, offensive lineman Ethan Boyd, doesn’t have quite the adjustment to make to town — he’s from East Lansing — but all four must adapt to the speed and demands of next-level workouts, playbooks and film study on top of the college classes and academic requirements. And they also will take part in the Spartans’ 15 spring practices after winter conditioning.

“It helps quite a bit,” Tucker said. “You get a chance to learn the playbook. You get a chance to get to know the staff, get indoctrinated to the strength and conditioning program and also nutrition. And academically, you get a chance to get your feet on the ground, and it's an opportunity to get off to a great start academically without the pressures of having to play a game.”

It is different for the five veterans who transferred to MSU: defensive back Kendall Brooks (Division II North Greenville in South Carolina), defensive end Drew Jordan (Duke), quarterback Anthony Russo (Temple), offensive lineman Jarrett Horst (Arkansas State) and running back Kenneth Williams III (Wake Forest). They already know what balancing studies with football looks like in college.

Thanks to an NCAA blanket transfer eligibility waiver due to COVID-19, all of them will be able to play for MSU immediately.

“I think it's important, and it helps,” Tucker said. “When you're looking for immediate impact players, we take that into consideration. I think players also take that into consideration when they decide to go in the portal.”

Tucker’s first season started late. He was hired Feb. 12, 2020, eight days after Mark Dantonio’s retirement and typically two to three months later than most Power Five jobs get filled. Then came the NCAA’s shutdown exactly a month after Tucker took over, wiping out his spring workouts. Add in a COVID-19 shutdown in late July and the Big Ten’s postponement then resumption of the season in the fall.

The Spartans went 2-5, with two games against Maryland scratched. But Tucker says playing in the fall was worth it.

“We found out a lot about our team,” he said. “COVID was a challenge for all of us. We were very fortunate to be able to practice and to play. I said that every single week during the season, because we wanted to coach and we wanted to play. And we were able to get that done, and we were able to do that in a safe manner.

“So, from my point of view, it was very productive, and we got a lot out of it.”

Andrew L. John | Palm Springs Desert Sun

Show Caption Hide Caption Michael Sam joins new cast of 'Dancing with the Stars' The NFL's first openly gay draft pick Michael Sam joins soul singer Patti LaBelle and actress Suzanne Somers for ABC's 20th season of 'Dancing with the Stars.' VPC

Actress Suzanne Somers had a most unusual encounter Friday evening: while livestreaming from her iconic Palm Springs, California, home, she was interrupted by an intruder who suddenly walked into the house.

No one was hurt in the incident and the man, who Somers briefly spoke with, left after he was informed he had entered a private residence.

The encounter, which lasted about four minutes, was captured toward the end of Somers' 49-minute broadcast.

In the video, Somers begins to talk about how she applies her favorite lipstick, when she abruptly stops.

“Is somebody here?” she asks her husband Alan Hamel, a former talk show host and television producer.

Hamel, who joined Somers on camera early in the livestream, has stepped out of the picture but is still nearby as the two have continued to talk during the broadcast.

“I just heard a person,” Somers says as she looks around.

“Really?” Hamel responds.

Another man's voice is then heard off-camera saying, “I’m here. Hi!”

Somers, 74, looks to the side then calmly tells the man, “Come here.” The man who sounds as if he has stepped closer, apologizes and says he’s terrified because ghosts were following him.

Somers asks the man his name. He says he is Aaron Carpenter. She then asks where he came from and he explains that a friend gave him access ""to the hill."" He says he just started walking.

“OK, you shouldn’t be here,” Somers says. “Yeah, this is our house,” says Hamel, 84.

Despite their surprise, Somers and Hamel remain calm throughout the ordeal.

“You don’t scare me,” Somers says to the man, “but you shouldn’t be here.”

Somers quickly looks into the camera, which is still rolling, and widens her eyes in disbelief.

“I’m not a scary person whatsoever,” the intruder says as Somers looks his way.

“I know, but I’m not used to people being on our property,” Somers responds as she points in the direction of the camera, “and we’re doing a show right now.”

Somers again asks how the man found his way onto the property and he says he was hiking on a trail along the mountain above the home and walked down.

He then says he has a gift for Somers, who says she doesn’t want anything.

Hamel crosses into camera range as he walks through the background of the broadcast in order to show the man out.

Not missing a beat, Somers' comedic timing kicks into gear. She quickly turns her head and stares wide-eyed into the camera, wordlessly appearing to question the oddness of what just happened.

She looks again in the direction of the intruder, as Hamel offers to show the man how to navigate his way off the property in the dark, and then turns back to the camera, leans forward and once more widens her eyes.

By this point some others off-camera begin to laugh.

“I’m sorry,” Somers says into the camera. “I’m as shocked as you all are. I’ve never had anybody just walk up onto my property, and he acted like it was all OK. It’s not OK.”

Palm Springs police Lt. Frank Browning said Saturday that no report had been filed about the incident. The department, however, is aware of Somers' Facebook post, he added.

Somers and Hamel are among the most well-known couples in the Coachella Valley, having lived in Palm Springs for decades.

The Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported in Feb. 2019 that Somers and Hamel planned to move from their much larger, longtime home into a much smaller $2.35 million hillside home near Bob Hope's old estate in the Southridge neighborhood.

The second home is located in a gated community, with round-the-clock security, just a stone's throw from their 28-acre compound in the Mesa neighborhood.

Having lived there for more than 40 years, it is where Somers and Hamel have entertained other celebrities including Barry Manilow and Kathy Griffin, as well as politicians and international cutting-edge doctors who contributed to Somers' best-selling books on alternative medicine.

In 2019, Somers told The Desert Sun they bought the smaller house because, ""it's time to downsize.""",'You shouldn't be here': Suzanne Somers' Facebook Live interrupted by home intruder

It was shortly after 8 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 22, when Calvin Johnson saw the silhouette of a hulking figure outside his Birmingham home.

Johnson had just finished a call with business associates and was on a semi-regular FaceTime with family members when there was a knock at his front door.

Johnson's wife, Brittney, asked Calvin to answer the door; she was expecting her friend, Mel, she said. But when the former Detroit Lions wide receiver looked outside, he could tell this was no Mel.

""I see this big figure through the glass and I’m like, 'That’s not your friend,'"" Johnson said Sunday. ""So me, I’m just like, 'OK, do I need to get my shotgun or what’s going on?' Cause I see a bunch of people outside my door. And she’s like, 'Just go answer the dang door.' And I’m like, 'All right, all right, all right.' I go answer the door, I peak around and it took about 2 seconds for it to sink in. And my hair just raised up.""

Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker surprised Johnson that night with news he was one of eight members of this year's enshrinement class.

Johnson had been elected to Canton three days earlier, during a nine-hour Zoom meeting of the Hall's 48 selectors, and Baker was in the midst of a cross-country ""door knock"" tour to let the eight members of this year's class know they got in.

Typically, Hall-of-Fame voting takes place the day before the Super Bowl, in a hotel conference room in the host city of the game.

All 15 modern-era finalists wait in nearby hotel rooms for either a call from Baker to let them know they were not elected, or a knock on their door with the good news they got in.

COVID-19 protocols made that impossible this year, so Baker and his colleagues came up with creative ways to let the enshrinees know in person.

With the help of Johnson's wife, who was in on the news, and former Detroit Lions public relations maven Bill Keenist, Baker gave Johnson the surprise of his life.

Keenist and Brittney Johnson coordinated a time the family would be home that Friday evening, as Baker flew in from Denver, where he had just let Peyton Manning know he was a member of the 2021 class.

Keenist, trying to be discreet, spent about 45 minutes parked a block away from Johnson's home, awaiting Baker's arrival and texting Brittney updates on the traveling party's whereabouts.

Baker and his film crew — the Hall of Fame's ""Knock on the Door"" show, with footage of Baker revealing the news to all eight members of this year's class, airs 8 p.m. Thursday on NFL Network — parked down the street from Keenist, and together the group crept through Johnson's neighborhood.

When Johnson answered the door, in basketball shorts, a T-shirt and his bare feet, Baker greeted him with, ""David Baker from the Hall of Fame ... am I disturbing you?"" as Johnson welled up with joy and his family watched on FaceTime.

""I made him come outside cause according to NFL protocols, we can’t go inside,"" Baker said. ""But we got a jacket with him pretty quick. But it was wonderful. What I love about this ... again, what we want all the fans to see is their heart. It is all about their journey. And we’re going to keep their legacy alive forever in Canton, Ohio, but at that moment, is about all the people that helped them get there, all the adversity that they overcame.""

Keenist said the moment ""was indescribably emotional and memorable ... one of the best things I’ve ever been involved with.""

""Once he realized, the smile on his face was priceless and it was, like I keep saying, magical,"" Keenist said. ""But it was. It was magical. And it was Calvin, just all the humility he’s always shown and the grace and the style. It was all him.""

Johnson, the best receiver in Lions receiver, kept the news mostly secret for 15 days, until Saturday's announcement.

He said he told a few of his former offensive lineman, ""We did it,"" early Saturday, and Baker said Johnson shed more tears when the class was announced later that day at the NFL Honors show.

""We all put in on this and we’re all here together,"" Johnson said of his former teammates. ""And those guys really appreciated that.""

Johnson said he is leaning toward having his old team chaplain at Georgia Tech, Derrick Moore, present him at the enshrinement ceremony Aug. 8.

His feud with the Lions over the money he repaid the team when he retired could be resolved by then, and the weekend will have a distinct Lions flavor. Former Lions defensive lineman Alex Karras, who was elected as part of last year's centennial class, will be enshrined Aug. 7 as part of a super-sized Hall-of-Fame weekend.

When Baker left Birmingham that Friday night, he said Johnson, just the seventh receiver elected to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot, asked if he was headed back to Canton.

Baker said he had to go knock on some more doors, to which Johnson responded, ""Oh, you're going to go collect some more tears.""

""To be a member of this excellent fraternity, to be a member of the guys that I grew up watching, to be alongside of the guys that I emulated my game after, to say, 'Hey, I did this because of you. I saw you do this.' To be able to meet those guys and have conversations with those guys, to learn more about what the game was like when they played, I had the fortune of ... having great conversations with the Hall-of-Famer Charlie Sanders, so I can only imagine with all the guys in the room, all the great stories that are there to be told,"" Johnson said. ""So just to be amongst such a great group of guys and the excellence and to be the best of the game, truly an honor. I’m still beside myself.""

Michael Brune | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption General Motors released its Super Bowl ad starring Will Ferrell General Motors released its Super Bowl ad that will star Will Ferrell touting the automaker's move toward an all-electric future. General Motors

On Super Bowl Sunday, GM and Toyota will spend millions selling us a vision of their brand, one they hope will appeal to today’s conscious consumers. They’re likely to use their few minutes on air to work to convince us how innovative and forward-thinking they are, how deeply invested in sustainability.

But is that true, or just slick advertising?

It’s worth taking a closer look at the car companies that will be splashing the best version of themselves across America’s TVs this Sunday. Auto manufacturers can play a key role in avoiding climate crisis and protecting public health — if they embrace strong vehicle pollution standards and invest in electric vehicles.

More: How the Biden administration could change the auto industry

The transportation sector is responsible for the US’s largest share of planet-warming emissions, and pollution from cars and trucks has been linked to asthma, bronchitis, increased risk of cancer, and even premature death. These health impacts disproportionately harm the low-income communities and communities of color near major roadways. Cars, trucks, and buses fueled by electricity rather than oil are much cleaner than gas guzzlers, even factoring in the emissions from the electricity used to charge them.

Instead of meaningfully addressing the health and climate impacts of their products, too many automakers have spent the last several years stuck in reverse. They claim to be aligned with the new Biden-Harris administration, which has embraced electric vehicles, and with the majority of US residents, who are interested in owning electric cars and want strong protections against vehicle pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars. But their actions have told a different story.

For years, automakers stalled progress on climate change and cleaning up our air. Consumers interested in electric vehicles often struggle to find them on dealer lots, in part because manufacturers don’t make or distribute enough of them.

Automakers spend a tiny fraction of their ad budgets on their plug-in products. When Donald Trump came into office, Toyota, GM, and other major automakers like Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) asked his administration to weaken Obama-era greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards for cars — which had been our government’s most ambitious program to reduce planet-warming emissions. Until recently, they also supported the Trump administration’s attack on California’s authority to protect its residents from vehicle pollution, which was the foundation of 14 other states’ authority to do the same.

More: Bruce Springsteen was 'all in' on Super Bowl ad with healing message

Toyota enjoys a reputation as a company that prioritizes sustainability because of the popularity of its hybrid Prius, which was innovative back in 2004. It still doesn’t have any fully electric cars on the market, and its CEO has spread misinformation about how much cleaner electric vehicles are than gas guzzlers. It conveniently dropped its support for the Trump administration’s dangerous and misguided lawsuits once a new administration took over. But in the face of a growing climate emergency, Toyota wants to return to much weaker, pre-Obama era vehicle emissions standards — which are far from sufficient to protect our climate and our communities’ health.

GM is also working to burnish its image as an environmentally friendly automaker. It recently announced its aspiration to sell only electric vehicles by 2035 and its plans to be carbon neutral by 2040.

It’s a noteworthy announcement, but we don’t yet know whether GM will work to meet these “aspirations” during the narrow window we have to avoid irreversible, catastrophic warming. And it isn’t clear if these commitments will stick over 20 years. In 2012, they stood with Obama in the Rose Garden to celebrate his new clean car standards -- and less than five years later, asked the Trump administration to weaken them. Is GM’s current commitment dependent on who occupies the White House?

To become the companies they try to appear to be on Super Bowl Sunday, all automakers must commit to a full transition to electric vehicles, and then back up those commitments with unequivocal support for federal, state and local policies that will rapidly transition the entire industry. These companies must also invest in manufacturing a range of electric vehicles, including those that are affordable for lower-income customers. And they should advertise them in diverse markets every day of the year, not just on Super Bowl Sunday. By doing so, they’ll be helping to protect communities’ health, slash climate pollution, and save families money on fuel.

Otherwise, they won’t just be guilty of greenwashing at the Super Bowl. They’ll continue to share responsibility for the unhealthy air breathed in by 150 million Americans every day — and for a climate crisis that’s bringing extreme heat and more devastating hurricanes, floods, and droughts to communities across the nation.

Paul Egan | Detroit Free Press

Show Caption Hide Caption Michigan governor says contact sports may resume Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says Michigan is lifting a monthslong ban on youth contact sports (Feb. 4) AP

LANSING – Nearly 1 in 4 of the donations made to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s campaign fund since she took office have come from outside Michigan — a high percentage for a state officeholder, and one that reflects her significant national profile.

Among residents of other states who have opened their wallets to support Whitmer are Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; entrepreneur/investor Chris Sacca, known for his appearances on TV's ""Shark Tank,"" and Jean Schulz, the widow of ""Peanuts"" cartoonist Charles Schulz and president of the board of directors at the Charles M. Schulz Museum.

Whitmer, a Democrat, has received 2,074 individual donations of $100 or more totaling nearly $522,000 from outside Michigan since 2019, a Free Press analysis shows.

That represents 24% of the donations she has received and nearly 17% of her total cash haul from individual donors since she took office.

""I don't think there's any surprise that Gov. Whitmer has a pretty high national profile,"" said Susan Demas, editor of the Michigan Advance, an online publication that covers Michigan politics.

""She gave the response to (former President Donald) Trump's last State of the Union; she was on the short list for vice president,"" Demas said, noting that Whitmer also was a national co-chair of former Vice President Joe Biden's successful Democratic campaign for president in 2020.

""She certainly is well known to Democrats across the country, and of course has been on pretty much every national talk show there is.""

By comparison, former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican who, unlike Whitmer, lived and worked in other states before he was elected, received only 30 out-of-state donations totaling $19,300 — less than 3% of his total — in the first three years after he took office, records show.

A Michigan Campaign Finance Network analysis showed former Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who also had a national profile and is soon expected to be confirmed as U.S. energy secretary, posted numbers similar to Whitmer's during her 2006 reelection campaign, with 27% of her contributions and 16% of her money coming from out of state, Crain's Detroit Business reported.

More: Granholm's nomination clears committee easily, vote heads to full Senate

The Center for Public Integrity reported in 2018 that nationwide, out-of-state contributions typically make up only 10% of direct gubernatorial fundraising.

Whitmer, who became known as “the woman from Michigan,” as a result of words Trump used in criticizing her handling of the coronavirus pandemic and for not being ""appreciative"" enough of his efforts to address the pandemic, has enjoyed especially strong out-of-state support from women.

Of Whitmer's out-of-state donors whose gender could reasonably be inferred based on their first names, 44% were women. That's a high percentage of female donors by historical standards, though women have been closing the donor gap with men in recent years.

Whitmer received donations from every state except North Dakota, plus money from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom. Donations from foreign residents are legal as long as the donors are U.S. citizens.

From New Hampshire, Whitmer received nine donations totaling $950. All nine donations came from seven women, records show.

Diane Scott of Chatham, New Hampshire, said she has no ties to Michigan but wanted to show her support for Whitmer by writing her a $100 check in October, shortly after federal and state officials revealed an alleged plot to kidnap Whitmer and brought felony charges against 14 men.

""I could see all the pushback she was getting for making rational decisions (related to the pandemic) intended to save people's lives,"" said Scott, who retired from nursing so she could spend more time painting. ""I thought, 'If I don't step up, who is going to step up?'

""Somebody has to let this woman know there are some sensible people out there.""

Scott said she made her donation to Whitmer through ActBlue, a nonprofit that allows Democratic donors to easily contribute to candidates around the country. The growth of easy-to-use online tools such as ActBlue likely has contributed to Whitmer's high level of out-of-state support.

Donors included actors, writers, attorneys, academics, corporate CEOs and online entrepreneurs — though few who are household names. As in other states, many of the donors support a range of Democratic, environmental and/or feminist causes.

Christopher Mills, a senior campaign adviser to Whitmer, said the ""vast majority"" of Whitmer's support continues to come from across Michigan, as she leads the state through one of the most difficult periods in its history.

She ""is the type of leader that people from all walks of life can trust and put their faith in because she stays focused on the kitchen-table issues that will help them get ahead,"" Mills said in an email.

Whitmer received close to 500 donations totaling nearly $121,000 from California alone.

In addition to Sandberg and Schulz, Whitmer's California donors include:

TV and film director Helaine Head, whose many credits include ""Cagney And Lacey,"" ""St. Elsewhere"" and ""L.A. Law.""

Actress and director Helen Lesnick, whose credits include ""A Family Affair,"" ""Inescapable"" and ""American Cyborg: Steel Warrior.""

Jonathan Bischke, co-founder of recruitment software company Entelo.

Sujo Offield, whose husband, Jim, is an heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune.

Of the California donations, 22 came from Berkeley, and most of those donors were connected with the University of California.

New York state was the second-biggest source of out-of-state funds for Whitmer. She received 182 donations from New York totaling $79,700.

Notable New York donors included:

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.

Arnold Glimcher, chairman of Pace Gallery in New York City.

Theatrical producer Amy Nederlander, who has Michigan ties and has been involved in numerous Broadway shows as a producer or investor, including “The Diary of Anne Frank” with Natalie Portman; “Salome” with Al Pacino; “Thurgood” with Laurence Fishburne; “The Merchant of Venice” with Pacino again; “Rent,” and “Hamilton.""

Friedrike Merck, a sculptor, activist and philanthropist who is heiress to the Merck pharmaceutical fortune.

Human rights activist Joyce Horman, the wife of journalist Charles Horman, who went missing when they were living in Chile. She was portrayed by actress Sissy Spacek in the 1982 film “Missing.""

Adelaide Gomer, the daughter of media executive and entrepreneur Roy Hampton Park, known for creating the Duncan Hines brand of food products. She serves as president of his foundation's board of trustees.

Other notable Whitmer donors from around the U.S. include:

In Georgia, Benjamin DeCosta, the former general manager of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta and now an aviation consultant.

Peter Hagedorn, a major Hawaii political donor and the son of Horace Hagedorn of Miracle-Gro fame.

In Illinois, Casey Cowell, the founder of U.S. Robotics, who also has strong ties to the Traverse City area.

In Indiana, Debbie Simon, the daughter of the late billionaire shopping mall developer Mel Simon, who co-owned the Indiana Pacers.

In Massachusetts, Arnold Hiatt, a major Democratic donor who was president of Stride Rite footwear company.

Also in Massachusetts, Barbara Lee, a philanthropist who only supports female candidates and whose foundation published, ""Keys to the Governor’s Office: The Guide for Women Running for Governor.""

In Nebraska, Norm Waitt, founder and chairman of the Waitt Co. in Omaha. He and his brother Ted founded Gateway Computers, where Snyder, the former Michigan governor, was a top executive.

In Washington state, Nancy Nordhoff a philanthropist and environmentalist mostly known for her involvement in feminist causes. She founded the Hedgebrook Writer’s Retreat.

Also in Washington, Internet entrepreneur Richard Barton, who founded online travel company Expedia Inc. and the online real estate company Zillow.

Laura Cox, who until Saturday was chair of the Michigan Republican Party, has criticized Whitmer's many appearances on national TV, accusing her of campaigning for Biden's VP spot and neglecting problems in Michigan.

Tom Shields, a longtime Republican strategist and consultant in Lansing, said opponents will also sometimes attack politicians for raising too much money out of state, saying they should be more focused on their home state. But those criticisms typically come from opponents who have been outraised and the general public generally does not care where a candidate's financial support originates, he said.

Shields said he is surprised that the amount of support Whitmer is receiving from outside Michigan is not higher than it is, given her national profile.

With no clear Republican opponent emerging yet for 2022, it is possible Whitmer has not had to make a concerted effort yet to raise money beyond Michigan's borders, Shields said.

""If she gets on the danger list at some point over the next two years, she has the ability to raise a whole lot more"" from outside Michigan, Shields said.

Show Caption Hide Caption COVID-19 takes a toll in Michigan The early days of the coronavirus pandemic left many unprepared. Families remember their loved ones who were among the state's first victims. Brian Kaufman, Gina Kaufman, Elisha Anderson and Kristi Tanner, Detroit Free Press

It was one year ago today that a man named Li Wenliang died. Maybe you remember him. Maybe you don’t. But today we all should. Because he wasn’t the first person in China to die of COVID-19, but he was possibly the first to try and warn people about it.

And he was told to shut up.

Li, who was only 34, was an ophthalmologist in Wuhan. He and his wife were expecting a second child. Just before the New Year, he posted a warning in a chat room about this strange, new virus. He cautioned about human-to-human spread. He knew that people were secretly being quarantined.

Just days later, he was hauled in by Chinese authorities and forced to sign a statement that his warning was illegal, a rumor, and not grounded in fact.

He died the next month, having caught the disease from a patient.

It is crucial to recall Li’s story on the anniversary of his passing, because even now, a full year into The Age of Coronavirus, information is still being withheld, questioned, suppressed, pushed forward and yanked back.

In truth, you could argue that the biggest frustration with COVID-19, beyond its obvious health dangers, is the endless spin cycle of misinformation about it.

What should we believe?

Think of the theories that, at some point over the past year, were presented as the truth. They are staggering in their confusion.

You don’t need a mask. You must wear a mask. Travel shouldn’t be limited. Travel must be limited. You can’t catch it unless someone is sneezing and coughing. You can catch it from people who seem healthy. You must wipe down every delivery box and wait hours to open it. You needn’t do all that, you can’t catch it from a box.

Stay 6 feet apart. Eight feet apart. Ten feet apart. It can’t hang in the air. It can hang in the air. Airplanes are petri dishes. Airplanes are totally safe. Wear gloves everywhere you go. Don’t wear gloves, they hold the disease.

Cover your eyes. Don’t cover your eyes. One mask is fine. Two masks are better. Children are at risk. Children aren’t at risk. You can’t get it twice. You can get it twice. Once you have it, you’re immune for years. Once you have it, you’re immune for three months.

Animals will spread it. Animals won’t spread it. Two million Americans will die in a year. Death numbers are being inflated. It should be gone by Easter. It should be gone by summer. It should be gone by 2021. It won’t be gone for years.

The vaccine is the answer. The vaccine is a step. The vaccine protects you from getting it. The vaccine only protects you from symptoms. You can’t spread it once you’re vaccinated. You can spread it once you’re vaccinated.

The vaccine is good for years. Oops, you may need a booster. The vaccine protects from new strains. Oops, it may not protect from new strains. The vaccine is perfectly safe. The vaccine has side effects. Actually, we don’t know all the side effects.

Schools are safe. Schools are dangerous. Restaurants are OK. Restaurants are not.

And the most maddening statements of all:

We don’t know the long-term behavior of the virus.

We don’t know the long-term effects of the virus.

We don’t know the long-term implications of the vaccine.

Now. Go. Make a wise decision.

Huh?

No closer to answers

A year after Dr. Li was forced to sign papers branding him a liar, a team from the World Health Organization finally landed in China to, ostensibly, investigate the origins of the disease. A year later? Yes. And this was only permitted after weeks of wrangling and backtracking by the Chinese government.

Does anyone really believe that the WHO team will be allowed to see anything truly incriminating to China? If you were on that trip, wouldn’t the first question you’d ask be “Why did you silence the guy who issued the earliest warnings about this thing? And how are you any different now?”

Forget that. Those questions don’t get asked, and those answers never come. And so once again, even in trying to determine something as vital as where this pandemic truly began, we’ll have great distrust about information being provided. And in a world where we are used to getting proper information with a cursor click, this doesn’t sit well. We are not a patient population.

But we should remember Dr. Li. The dangers of not listening. The perils of blindly trusting a government. He had questions. We should continue to have questions. Honestly, anyone who doesn’t have some questions about this pandemic hasn’t been paying attention.

President Joe Biden glumly talks about a “dark winter.” But when it comes to coronavirus, we’ve been in the dark for a while. The only thing we’re sure of is that we’re not sure of anything. Not much comfort there.

Pudge Rodriguez weighs in

Show Caption Hide Caption Ex-Detroit Tiger Justin Verlander shares memorable moments in Detroit Former Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander reflects on the many memorable moments he had at Comerica Park, May 13, 2019. Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press Columnist

The Justin Verlander-Detroit Tigers saga is filled with historic memories, from no-hitters to World Series runs.

It can't really be over, right?

Maybe not.

The 37-year-old Verlander, currently with the Houston Astros, is set to enter free agency after the 2021 season, and the Tigers could be in the market for a veteran starter on a short-term deal — like Kenny Rogers in 2006 — to mentor the young arms in the rotation. The scenario makes too much sense not to consider.

""Coming back to the team he grew up with?"" former Tigers All-Star and Hall of Fame catcher Ivan ""Pudge"" Rodriguez told the Free Press on Wednesday. ""That's not a bad idea, to retire as a Tiger. That's where he started.""

MEMORIES: Justin Verlander's best Detroit Tigers moments

LESSONS FROM PUDGE: Inside former Tigers catcher Pudge Rodriguez's mentorship of Wilson Ramos

Verlander played 13 of his 16 MLB seasons for the Tigers (2005-17), racking up 183 of his 226 career wins. The right-hander won the American League Rookie of the Year and pitched the organization to the World Series in 2006. He secured the Cy Young and MVP in 2011, and in the following year, he helped the team back to the World Series.

On Aug. 31, 2017, Verlander was traded to the Astros — where now-Tigers manager AJ Hinch was at the helm — for three prospects. That year, Verlander finally won his elusive World Series. He added a second Cy Young to his resume in 2019.

[ Verlander wins World Series with Detroit still close to his heart ]

Then came the injury.

After one start in 2020, Verlander underwent Tommy John surgery on his pitching elbow in late September. With a 12- to 14-month timetable for recovery, he may have already thrown his final pitch for the Astros.

""I’m extremely disappointed, but I will not let this slow down my aspirations for my career,"" Verlander wrote on Instagram. ""I will approach this rehab the only way I know, attack and don’t look back. ... I’m confident that with a proper rehabilitation program and my unwavering commitment that this surgery will ultimately lengthen my career as opposed to shorten it.""

Verlander, essentially missing two full seasons, should come at a bargain on the open market. He will be 39 years old when the 2022 campaign begins, and there aren't many pitchers who have bounced back from such a career-shaking surgery at his age.

But there's a chance Verlander has a few years left in the tank. He might not reach back to throw 100 mph ever again, yet he's smart enough to change his approach and outthink hitters.

""First of all, he needs to come back healthy,"" Rodriguez said. ""Tommy John surgeries always take a long time. He's still with the Astros, and what he needs to focus on right now is to come back healthy and be the Justin Verlander that he was in the past.""

If the Tigers were able to add Verlander, he could join a starting rotation that included Spencer Turnbull, Casey Mize, Tarik Skubal and Matt Manning. If Mize, Skubal and Manning develop as expected, that's a postseason-caliber rotation, with a future Hall of Famer counseling the crew.

[ What we learned from AJ Hinch: A Justin Verlander return in 2022? ]

Next winter's shortstop market is strong: Carlos Correa, Corey Seager, Trevor Story and Francisco Lindor. And the top offensive prospects within the farm system — third baseman Spencer Torkelson and outfielder Riley Greene — could be in the majors by next season, with catcher Dillon Dingler not far behind.

If owner Christopher Ilitch and general manager Al Avila show they're willing to spend on offensive upgrades to put the franchise in a position to reach the playoffs, it wouldn't be impossible to get Verlander on board.

[ Tigers owner believes in process, will spend when 'time is right' ]

""It's his decision,"" Rodriguez said. ""Obviously, I'm sure if the Tigers offer him a contract after this season, he's going to consider it. But right now, in my opinion, he's probably not thinking about anything. He's thinking about getting healthy and back to the mound.""

There's another twist that makes this scenario seem possible.

Hinch said he developed a ""great relationship"" with Verlander while serving as his manager from the time he was traded in August 2017 through the end of the 2019 season. When Verlander learned Hinch got the job in Detroit this past October, the former AL MVP sent him a text message.

""There's no place like it,"" Verlander said, according to Hinch. ""It's an incredible place of a loyal fan base that wants baseball played the right way, wants baseball played a winning way. And they have a deep-rooted history, love affair with the Tigers and English D.""

For subscribers: AJ Hinch, the Detroit Tigers and the fairy-tale ending he's seeking

Verlander is 43-15 with a 2.45 ERA in 477 innings across 74 starts in his career with the Astros. During Hinch's final year in 2019, Verlander reached 300 strikeouts for the first time in his career across 223 innings. He had 21 wins (second most to his 24 victories in 2011) and a 2.58 ERA.

""He's an all-timer, Hall of Famer,"" Hinch said. ""Incredible competitor. We had some incredible experiences together.""

If the Verlander-Tigers relationship continues, it will ultimately come down to two factors.

1. Verlander loves Detroit.

2. Detroit — eager for a postseason push in 2022 — needs Verlander.

""He said nothing but incredible things about his experience here,"" Hinch said.

While catching up with Rodriguez, the Free Press asked him about the Tigers' rebuild, his son's MLB career and more.

Do the 2021 Tigers remind you of a particular team from your five-year stint with the organization?

""When I got there in 2004. We developed a baseball team, and then, in two years, we went to the World Series in 2006. I think that's what I'm seeing right now. They want to go young. They want to see what these young players can do. And that's not bad. That's not a bad idea to do. Obviously, you have to get them to develop at the big-league level, and I think that's probably going to happen this year. They still have a great team. I see where the Tigers have a good pitching staff. When you have a good pitching staff, you're going to win a lot of games.""

The rebuild is about to enter its fifth season. Considering the lengthy process, do you see a bright future for the Tigers?

""When you have a young team, you're going to have a team together for a long, long time. That's what Al Avila is doing. He's putting the young, talented players on the field this year to perform. I think that's what the fans in Detroit are going to see. They still have Miguel Cabrera and some veterans there, but I think the way that baseball is today, the Tigers are going to see a lot of young talented players on the field.""

Speaking of Verlander possibly finishing his career in Detroit, do you wish you could have ended yours with the Rangers?

""No, I'm fine with my career. I have no regrets with anything. I still work for the Texas Rangers' organization. I'm not a player now, but I'm with their organization in the front office. That's more than enough. I played a long, long time there, and I'm very happy right now that I'm working with the Rangers.""

Your son, Dereck, joined the Tigers in late August off waivers from the San Francisco Giants. Although he is now with the Colorado Rockies, was it exciting to see him get a chance with your former team?

""It was nice. I talked to (Avila), and I told him that he's going to be a good addition to the organization. Unfortunately, he got hurt. He hurt his elbow (at the alternate training site) in Toledo, just pitching there. He didn't have the chance to reach the big leagues (in 2020). That's part of baseball. Anyway, when the news came in, Al called me and told me that he's going to be one of the key pitchers for them. But, unfortunately, he got hurt and things changed a little bit.""

Do you have any plans to return to Comerica Park for an appearance?

""I've done one or two or three appearances throughout year. I go there and do Q&A's at the ballpark and sign autographs. Before this pandemic happened, that's what I was doing for the Tigers. Right now, we don't have anything in plans, probably because of the COVID situation. Everything has slowed down. But I'm looking forward to the next call from the Tigers. It's a great team, great organization. I played five years, and the fans in Detroit are tremendous in the support they gave us when I was there was A-plus. That's why I have so much respect for the fans in Detroit.""

Adrienne Roberts | Detroit Free Press

TorranceLearning's office in downtown Chelsea is a point of pride for founder and CEO Megan Torrance — it's in a historic clock tower building that used to be an old factory, it's 7,500 square feet, way more than needed for 22 employees, and is used to host 80-person paid workshops several times a year.

But her employees haven't stepped foot into the office since March, and it's possible that some never will.

That's because, for the first time in the company's 14-year existence, Torrance is hiring for remote-only positions, a decision driven by the desire to widen the hiring pool as the instructional design company expands.

The idea that the new hires could work remotely indefinitely became easier to envision in the pandemic, Torrance said.

""We have had people turn down offers, we have had great employees who just couldn't keep up with (the commute) and we lost them,"" said Torrance. ""So that was hard from a location perspective.""

In the fall, Torrance felt like she needed more employees to keep up with clients who were resuming work after putting projects on hold at the beginning of the pandemic, and new clients had a need for corporate learning videos.

""We realized that we actually have in 2021, despite the pandemic, the opportunity to intentionally grow and do some really cool things,"" she said. ""At the same time, when I post jobs, most of the resumes I get are not from southeast Michigan.""

Torrance used to specify that applicants need to live locally. ""But then we said, 'Actually, it doesn't matter.'""

Now, she has two new employees: one who lives in North Carolina, the other in Minnesota.

Expanding the talent pool

TorranceLearning is one of a growing number of companies in Michigan that despite having an office are offering potential hires the opportunity to work fully remotely. Silicon Valley technology companies were some of the first to head in this direction even before the pandemic, a shift that has only intensified recently, said Jerry Davis, a professor of management at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

""The impetus to have remote workers is exacerbated in places like Silicon Valley, where housing prices are insane and the traffic (pre-COVID) is soul-destroying,"" Davis said. ""So, I expect to see a lot more work-from-home after COVID.""

But even in Michigan, where housing prices and traffic aren't as much of a factor, some companies are moving in this direction.

General Motors Co. said in November it's hiring 3,000 engineers, designers and technology specialists by the end of the first quarter as it works to bring more electric vehicles to the market quickly. Most of those people can work remotely, opening up the talent pool across the nation, GM said.

More: COVID-19 has transformed work. It could revolutionize the office next

More and more companies like GM are hiring after a tough year. The U.S. economy added 49,000 jobs in January, the U.S. Department of Labor said Friday, bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.3%. Still, that's higher than it was before the pandemic, and many companies and workers may have to be flexible in finding the right fit.

When Ann Arbor cybersecurity startup Blumira removed the location requirement from its open positions, the company immediately began getting national attention from prospective employees.

""We were explicit about the opportunity to work from home, whereas before it was Ann Arbor with flexible work,"" said Mike Behrmann, director of security at the 2-year-old company.

Blumira more than doubled in size to 30 employees during the pandemic, hiring employees with backgrounds in forensics, along with front- and back-end developers, from as far away as Connecticut, and in Ohio and other parts of Michigan.

""Really, in order to make a best-in-class company, we have to hire best in class,"" said Behrmann. ""And that just means opening up our application pool nationwide.""

While a transition to remote hires may be ultimately beneficial for companies, it will make jobs more competitive if location limitations are removed.

""If what you do can be done by remote workers connected via Zoom, then the potential pool of applicants for that job could be global,"" said Davis.

To be sure, many jobs don't have the option of being done remotely. Michigan has a higher proportion of jobs in the manufacturing sector compared with many other states, jobs that most often must be done in person.

Remote work isn't for everyone

Even if a job can be done remotely, said Linda Ferrante, vice president of operations for the Farmington Hills-based recruiting firm RFT Search Group, not all employees are happy doing that long term.

Ferrante said even before the pandemic, large organizations whose leadership was spread out across the country were hiring for remote positions, such as project management and executive assistant positions.

""But if it was so great, I wouldn't be talking to candidates who are doing that and looking for something new,"" she said. ""They're missing connectivity with people. It's hard to get to know somebody through a 20-minute Zoom call or through an hour phone call a day.""

Some companies, though, like the staffing firm Kelly Services, say remote work is the way of the future.

The Troy-based company started its ""Kelly Anywhere"" program four years ago, allowing corporate employees to work remotely for three days a week. That only accelerated during the pandemic, and Kelly Services is now hiring employees who don't live near an office and may work at home full time, said Alexandra Foster, senior director of people strategy and experience at Kelly Services.

Hiring for these remote-only positions has ramped up in the pandemic, she said.

But more applicants are looking for that option

""What you see is that people are really looking for that,"" Foster said. ""You're finding pockets of talent in places that didn't exist before. We're just being agile and responding to the marketplace.""

So far, Jen Hoeke, who just started working for TorranceLearning this month from her home in Minneapolis, is enjoying her remote position. This isn't Hoeke's first time working remotely — she did contract work for many years that required a combination of in-office meetings and working from home. But this is her first time starting a full-time job remotely, which feels different.

""Normally in an office, when you first get hired you meet people in the lunchroom, when you're going into work and when you're leaving,"" Hoeke said. ""You get a chance to chat and build that rapport with them.""

Instead, Torrance scheduled one-on-one video meetings with Hoeke and her coworkers. She's enjoying it so far, especially because her job is creative and she needs to concentrate.

""In a typical office environment, I would find myself working late, or coming in really early to get some quiet time and get into the zone,"" she said. ""One thing that's really a positive for me when I work from home is it's a little bit easier to create that for myself.""

Slone Terranella | Detroit Free Press

A typical Super Bowl Sunday means big-screen TVs, a stockpile of food and a large group of people. In the age of coronavirus, of course, everything looks different.

Due to the 25% capacity limit for indoor dining, a number of bars and restaurants appeared hollow in downtown Detroit just before the game, when compared to previous Super Bowl Sundays.

Kenny Valentino, 32, is the manager of Delmar Detroit, a bar and restaurant. He said the restaurant's capacity, with the current state mandates, is roughly 67 people.

Valentino said Delmar officially opened its indoor dining space on Saturday, since the state-wide indoor dining shutdown that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued in November.

Like most Michigan restaurants on Sunday, the crowd in Delmar looked sparse due to the limited capacity restrictions.

It was definitely slower in comparison to other years, but they still had a flow of people, Valentino said. The restaurant projected the Super Bowl along its walls, and people ate and watched the game in a somewhat normal fashion.

More: Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions 'moving in the right direction' toward reconciliation

Despite the limited seating and other restrictions, Valentino said people understand the circumstances. Many customers either made reservations or called ahead to see if the restaurant had any space, he said.

""It's a downer that you can't do a traditional Super Bowl party, because of the curfew,"" Valentino said. ""The Super Bowl is not going to be over at 10 p.m. So a lot of people, instead of coming into bars and restaurants, they rather just stay at home and watch the game.""

Valentino's inclination about people opting to stay at home while watching the game isn't far off. As last-minute and regular shoppers flocked to grocery stores, people found themselves waiting in long lines or navigating congested parking lots before the game.

At a Meijer location at 23 Mile Road, Kaela Renner, 24, of Chesterfield, said she only bought the items she needed immediately and forfeited everything else she needed for the week because of the checkout lines.

""I ended up buying only like five things because I didn't want to wait in the long line,"" she said.

However, Ari Pearlman, 23, of West Bloomfield, got what she needed.

She visited the Meijer in Commerce Charter Township because she needed to restock on food, she said. It wasn't too busy when she walked in, nut about 11 a.m., the Meijer started getting more packed.

Pearlman also said her father went to a Kroger a few hours later because he needed items solely for the Super Bowl. She said her father was surprised because it wasn't too horrible, and he thought the store would be busier given the occasion.

Aman Bhogal, 23, of Wixom, noticed the throngs as she picked up her groceries Sunday at a Meijer in Wixom, however. She was able to grab her groceries and leave, but she said cars and people packed the parking lot.

Big-box retailers weren't the only stores with a surge of people and long lines, either. Prins Williams, 24, went with his aunt to 168 Asian Mart located in Madison Heights.

Williams said he's celebrating the Super Bowl by buying tons of seafood with his aunt instead of going out. He said the Asian market was ""very busy,"" and the checkout lines were long. But he's happy he was able to snag some of his favorite seafood before the big game.

Although this year has been tough for restaurants, Valentino said they're making the best out of a bad situation. If coronavirus didn't exist, he's certain every seat would be filled and people would pack the restaurant.

""We just want people to do what they need to do so that we can get past COVID and get back to some type of normalcy,"" Valentino said.

Givani Smith had a statement game for the Detroit Red Wings, earrning a Gordie Howe hat trick to help them snap an eight-game winless skid.

While it was a terrific showing for the 2016 second-round draft pick, the Wings’ 4-1 victory over the Florida Panthers on Sunday at BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida, did not reflect well on Anthony Mantha, a 2013 first-rounder who sat out the game as a healthy scratch. Considering how poorly the Wings had fared since losing five players to COVID-19 the opening week of the season, pulling Mantha was quite a message.

“I just made the decision to go with the group I went with,” coach Jeff Blashill said. “Any conversation I had with Anthony is private. I’m not going go to comment further.”

Teammate Robby Fabbri, who recorded his second goal of the season after being sidelined for most of the season by COVID-19, raved about Smith.

“It was a great example of what he brings to the team,” Fabbri said. “He has had a great mentality coming in and doing what is needed. He did a little bit of everything with a hit, a goal and an assist. That’s what we need out of him.”

Smith, the 46th overall pick in 2016, had not heard of a Gordie Howe hat trick until informed by teammates. Named after the franchise legend, Smith completed the feat when he fought Aaron Ekblad — after scoring the Wings' second goal and setting up Fabbri's.

Smith’s goal and assist gave him four points in six games. He has been on and off the taxi squad, trying to make a case that, at 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, he can bring goals as well as grit to the lineup.

““The only thing I can really do is, the only time I am in the lineup, work my hardest and hopefully it pays off in the long run,” Smith said.

The Wings see Sunday’s outcome, which started with a goal from newcomer Marc Staal and finished with a goal from newcomer Vladislav Namestnikov, as well deserved after playing hard Friday against the defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

“You need results to build confidence,” Blashill said. “I talk about process lots, but ultimately you need results to build confidence. Getting the result was huge. “We played the type of game we have to play to be successful. We competed really hard and we defended and checked well. And we got to their net.”

Luke Glendening left in the first period after suffering an upper-body injury, but Blashill said Glendening “seemed in a good spot” after there game.

Thomas Greiss earned his first victory in a Wings uniform with 36 saves. Jonathan Bernier remained sidelined by an upper-body injury suffered when he was run into by Mantha on Jan. 28 in Dallas.

The Wings (3-8-2) play at Florida again Tuesday. Given their victory Sunday, Mantha could sit again. That would be a damming situation, considering he is a top-line player and signed for four years and $22.8 million in the offseason.

Each prospective vaccine goes through three phases of study in humans, and to speed the process, some developers are conducting two phases simultaneously.

Phase 1: Trials involve small numbers of people, testing whether the vaccine is safe and provokes an immune response.

Phase 2: Trials expand to hundreds of people, comparing the vaccine’s effects in different groups and further testing its safety.

Phase 3: Trials enroll many thousands of people, to see if those who receive the vaccine are less likely to become infected than those who receive a placebo.

Emergency Use Authorization: The FDA is granting COVID-19 vaccine candidates emergency use authorization, which means they can be used even though they have not been officially approved.

The FDA cleared Moderna’s vaccine for emergency use on Dec. 18, a week after Pfizer’s authorization, making it the second vaccine available in the US. A panel of outside experts recommended the FDA authorize Moderna’s vaccine the day before. The vaccine has since been authorized in Canada, Israel, and the European Union.

Moderna said Jan. 25 that its two-dose vaccine generates a weaker immune response against a strain of the disease that first emerged in South Africa, prompting the firm to plan a clinical trial in the United States of a “booster” shot that recipients would receive.

On Jan. 19, Maine and Michigan reported that they may need to dispose of 16,000 Moderna vaccines, which may have spoiled due to temperature problems in transportation. A day later, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city is experiencing supply shortages with the Moderna vaccine, resulting in 23,000 rescheduled vaccine appointments. Moderna said the the distribution problems are beyond its control.

As of Jan. 26, Moderna said that it has supplied the US government with 30.4 million doses of its vaccine. The US has agreed to purchase 200 million doses of the vaccine with options for an additional 300 million.

The company confirmed it is on track to deliver 100 million doses to the US by the end of the first quarter and “potentially 1 billion doses for 2021.”

Approach: The Moderna technology — called messenger RNA — inserts portions of the virus’s RNA into cells, which then manufacture a piece of the virus to trigger an immune response. The company set a drug industry record by producing its vaccine in 42 days after receiving the genetic sequence of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Funding: On Aug. 11, the government awarded Moderna $1.5 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine proves safe and effective. This funding came in addition to the almost $1 billion already provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

New York City | Germany • Phase 3

Pfizer and BioNTech

Status of clinical trials: Authorized for use in US, UK, Canada, other countries. Phase 3 trial

Efficacy: 95 percent

Dose: 2 shots, 3 weeks apart

The FDA authorized emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 11, the first vaccine authorized in the US.

When it was cleared in the US, it already had been authorized elsewhere: Britain’s drug regulator granted Pfizer its first emergency-use approval on Dec. 2, and Bahrain said it became the second later that week. On Dec. 9, Canada’s health regulator approved the vaccine, and it was cleared in Mexico on Dec. 11.

According to early findings of a study published Jan. 7, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to work against a key mutation found in two highly contagious strains of the illness.

Documents released by the FDA on Dec. 8 suggest the Pfizer vaccine candidate provides strong protection against COVID-19 after the first dose, but experts said they still recommend patients get the second shot. On Dec. 23, Pfizer and BioNTech agreed in a nearly $2 billion deal to supply the US with an additional 100 million doses of the vaccine. The companies already had a contract to supply 100 million doses to the US under Operation Warp Speed.

Approach: Pfizer, which has a manufacturing plant in Andover, is deploying technology similar to Moderna’s: a messenger RNA vaccine that codes for the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. BioNTech’s US headquarters is located in Cambridge.

Funding: Pfizer agreed to pay BioNTech $185 million upfront, and BioNTech has a debt financing agreement with the European Investment Bank.

Cambridge, England | Oxford, England • Phase 3

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford

Status of clinical trials: Authorized for use in UK, Argentina, India, Mexico. Phase 3 in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa

Efficacy: 70 percent

Dose: 2 shots, 4 weeks apart

The UK authorized the vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford on Dec. 30, as did Argentina. India followed suit on Jan. 3, and Mexico approved it on Jan. 4.

The results from a peer-reviewed study on the vaccine candidate published Dec. 8 suggest it is about 70 percent effective, but questions remain as to how well it works in older populations. The company temporarily halted its vaccine trails on Sept. 6 due to suspected adverse reaction in a participant.

Approach: In a partnership with the University of Oxford, the British-Swedish company has developed a vaccine that uses a weakened version of a common-cold virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells to provoke an immune response.

Funding: BARDA has provided more than $1 billion in funding.

Updated Jan. 4





New Brunswick, N.J. • Phase 3

Johnson & Johnson

Status of clinical trials: Phase 3 trial began in September

Efficacy: 66 percent

Dose: 1 shot

Johnson & Johnson asked US regulators to clear its one-shot vaccine for emergency use on Feb. 4. It is the first step in a regulatory process that that could lead to the rollout of the third COVID-19 vaccine in the US within a few weeks.

Johnson & Johnson said Jan. 29 that its vaccine is 66 percent effective in preventing moderate and severe global COVID-19 cases.

The US government said it would commit $1 billion for 100 million J&J doses if the vaccine is authorized.

On Oct. 12, STAT reported the study was paused due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, but the trial has since resumed. In November, J&J said it also began a clinical trial that would test the vaccine’s efficacy at two doses, instead of one.

Approach: The company developed the vaccine with the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The vaccine uses a common-cold virus to deliver part of the coronavirus into cells to stimulate the immune system to fight off an infection.

Funding: In addition to the $1 billion commitment from the federal government, J&J and BARDA have invested more than $1 billion in the effort.

Updated Feb. 4





Gaithersburg, Md. • Phase 3

Novavax

Status of clinical trials: Phase 3 in the United Kingdom and US

Efficacy: 89 percent

Dose: 2 shots, 3 weeks apart

Novavax said on Jan. 28 its COVID-19 vaccine appears 89 percent effective based on early findings from a study in the UK.

Novavax began a Phase 3 trial with 30,000 people in the US and Mexico for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate on Dec. 28. Its other Phase 3 trial in the UK began in September, and the company said early results are expected in the first quarter of 2021.

On Nov. 9, the FDA granted Maryland-based Novavax “Fast Track Designation” for its vaccine.

Approach: The company is expanding its manufacturing capacity and pursuing late-stage clinical trials. Its vaccine candidate uses protein nanoparticles, together with a proprietary compound, to generate and enhance the immune response.

Funding: The firm has been awarded $1.6 billion by the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, and previously received $388 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Updated Jan. 28





Tubingen, Germany • Phase 2/3

CureVac

Status of clinical trials: Phase 2/3 in Germany

Dose: 2 shots, 4 weeks apart

On Dec. 14, CureVac said it launched a Phase 2/3 trial in Germany with plans to recruit more than 35,000 participants.

Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said on Feb. 3 that it would help CureVac manufacture 100 million doses its vaccine candidate this year. GSK will also invest $181 million to support CureVac research aimed at developing new vaccines that target emerging COVID-19 variants.

Approach: The firm, which has about 20 employees at its US hub in Boston, is manufacturing a vaccine candidate that relies on messenger RNA.

Funding: CureVac has received an $85 million loan from the lending arm of the European Union and a grant of up to $8.3 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Updated Feb. 3





Paris | London • Phase 1/2

Sanofi and GSK

Status of clinical trials: Phase 1/2 trials began in September

Sanofi and GSK planned to begin a Phase 3 trial in December, but on Dec. 11 the companies said they suffered a setback based on early data. Sanofi’s global medical head for vaccines told STAT News the problem relates to “inadequate results in older adults” from its candidate, which the company traced back to “an inadequate formulation of their vaccine.”

The companies plan to begin another Phase 2 trial in February, and a Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of 2021. The setback will push the estimated timeline for distribution of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine from the first half of 2021 into the second half of the year, pending authorization.

Amid delays in Sanofi’s vaccine timeline, the French government has been pressing Sanofi to manufacture vaccines from its rivals. On Jan. 27, agreed to make 125 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Approach: The vaccine candidate builds on work the French drug giant did in the SARS epidemic and employs technology Sanofi used in one of its flu vaccines. Sanofi is using one of GSK’s proprietary adjuvants, an ingredient for vaccines that can create stronger and longer-lasting immunity.

Funding: BARDA has provided $30 million in funding and the US government’s Operation Warp Speed is providing up to $2.1 billion.

Updated Jan. 27





Beijing • Phase 3

Sinovac Biotech

Status of clinical trials: Phase 3 trials in Brazil began in July, and Phase 3 trials began in Indonesia in August and Turkey in September

Efficacy: more than 50 percent

Dose: 2 shots, 2 weeks apart

At the end of December, the vaccine developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical firm was found to be more than 50 percent effective in a Brazilian clinical trial, but researchers delayed releasing more information at the request of Sinovac.

On Sept. 16, Sinovac submitted an application for a Phase 1/2 trial of the vaccine candidate in children. Sinovac signed a manufacturing deal to supply Indonesia with at least 40 million doses by March if the vaccine is approved.

Approach: The Sinovac vaccine, called CoronaVac, uses a whole coronavirus that has been inactivated, so that it will trigger an immune response without causing illness. Unlike most of the other vaccine candidates under study, this is a proven vaccine method. But such vaccines, which must be grown in cultures, take longer to manufacture than those based on the virus’s genetic material.

Funding: This spring, Sinovac received $15 million in private investment, as well as an $8.5 million loan from the Bank of Beijing.

Updated Dec. 24





Paris | Lexington, Mass. • Preclinical

Sanofi and Translate Bio

Status of clinical trials: Preclinical, or not yet being tested in people

Approach: The companies are collaborating on messenger RNA vaccines in a partnership that expands on a 2018 deal to develop such vaccines for as many as five infectious diseases. Translate specializes in developing mRNA medicines.

Funding: Sanofi is paying Translate $425 million upfront. The companies hope to start a trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Updated July 28





Kenilworth, N.J. • Preclinical

Merck and IAVI

Status of clinical trials: Merck & Co. announced in January it was discontinuing development of its two experimental Covid-19 vaccines after early trial data showed they failed to generate immune responses comparable to a natural infection or existing vaccines.

Approach: The drug giant was partnering with the nonprofit IAVI on a coronavirus vaccine related to the company’s existing Ebola vaccine.

Funding: BARDA had provided $38 million.

Updated Jan. 25





Basel, Switzerland • Preclinical

Novartis

Status of clinical trials: Preclinical, or not yet being tested in people

Approach: A subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is collaborating with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital on a vaccine that uses a harmless virus as a Trojan horse to deliver the genetic sequence of the coronavirus into human cells to produce an immune response.

Funding: The collaboration has received a $1 million donation from Boston Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck.

It was her company, the one she had devoted her life to, the one her father had founded and built and then passed on to her.

WHITINSVILLE — Amy Yag Sondrup’s stomach was in knots. She had spent a week going over org charts, circling the names of employees she could afford to keep. For three terrible months since COVID-19 blossomed into a global crisis early last year, she had held on while her business was being decimated. Now, in May, she had an agonizing task ahead of her.

The 175 people who worked for her — sales executives, carpenters, designers, accountants — were family. Some she had known all her life — or, as those people sometimes said when they saw her, lowering a hand toward the floor, since she was “this big.” Their labor had given her a privileged life. She felt a duty to support them.

But her company, Access TCA, sat directly in the pandemic’s destructive path. It catered to a niche in the marketing world — designing and building elaborate, interactive exhibits that biotech and pharmaceutical companies use at trade shows. It was a thriving industry, until the virus transformed large indoor gatherings into potentially deadly superspreader events. Almost overnight, Access’s livelihood evaporated.

Sondrup found ways in those early months to keep paying employees, telling them and herself that the pandemic would subside and business would rebound. But now, on this Monday morning, with money running out and no end to the pandemic in sight, there were no more options. In a few hours, she had to face her employees in a company-wide Zoom meeting and deliver the news: All but a few dozen of them would be furloughed.

She poured herself a cup of coffee, with French vanilla creamer, and ate a bowl of Crispix. Then she went into the room in her North Providence home she had recently converted to an office and opened her laptop. After a video call with department heads and another with the finance team, it was time. Sondrup hit the “launch meeting” button and watched the frames appear on her screen.

Her employees looked back at her from kitchen tables, living rooms, and basements, wearing sweatpants, drinking coffee, holding children in their laps.

Sondrup tried to comfort herself: They were well aware of the state of their industry. They knew the government loan now paying their salaries was about to run out. Surely, they knew the reason she had gathered them.

Still, as she took a breath to speak, she knew that for some of them, hearing the words out loud might be devastating — and it might also be for her.

Sondrup’s entire life was bound up in the company. Her father launched it the year she was born, in 1984, in a massive 19th-century textile machine shop in Whitinsville, a village in the Central Massachusetts town of Northbridge that was once a mecca of American industrial development. As a 5-year-old, she sometimes went to work with her father and fashioned an office for herself in a phone booth, punching numbers into an adding machine and imagining she was in charge.

In time, Sondrup was doing real work for the company, wiping down booths at convention centers and putting labels on newsletters. Later, she worked summers as a receptionist. Sometimes she came in on weekends to hang out in the graphics department, just for fun.

Sondrup was the oldest of three children and grew up knowing her father wanted her to take over the business. But then came college, and she ran the other way. She moved to Salt Lake City to study history, a long-time passion; she was fascinated by the impact major events had on societies and the people who lived in them. After getting her master’s degree, she stayed to teach at a small liberal arts college.

Then, when she was 25, she got a phone call from her father’s longtime chief financial officer. It was time to come back, the executive said. Her father wanted to start handing over the reins. She put it in terms Sondrup could not refuse: You owe it to your family.

Sondrup’s father, Mike Yag, asked her to try it for a year. If she didn’t like it, he said, she could go get her PhD. But when Sondrup walked back through the door at Access, she knew she was where she was meant to be.

Over the next five years, the boss’s daughter rose swiftly through the ranks; then, after a shakeup of senior management, she was in charge. She carried on some of her father’s traditions — Doughnut Day on the last Friday of the month and summer picnics at the lake — and created a few of her own, including Christmas parties at the bowling alley with nachos and beer. Her father remains CEO and chairman but is no longer involved in day-to-day operations.

As a woman and someone under 50, Sondrup, now 36, is an anomaly among her peers in the trade-show industry. She’s 5-foot-3 and famous around the building for her high heels. She has more than 200 pairs at home; a sign on her office door features a pair of sky-high Louboutins. And there’s always a bottle of whiskey on hand for anyone having a bad day.

After taking over, she quickly found success and rose in importance in the industry. Between 2017 and 2019, she grew the company’s revenue 35 percent and added about 60 employees. In 2020, she was selected president of the industry’s trade group, the Experiential Designers and Producers Association, the youngest ever to hold the position and the first to hold it for two terms.

Access TCA’s longest-serving employees — some of whom she worked side by side with, cutting and painting letters in the shop to prepare for the company’s biggest show of the year — told Sondrup they were proud of her, like fond aunts and uncles.

Then, in late February of 2020, the virus came.

Sondrup was in Düsseldorf, Germany, at the massive international retail trade fair EuroShop. The coronavirus until then had been mostly a distant concern, centered halfway around the world. But now, it was rapidly spreading in Europe, and cases were showing up in the United States. Before long, trade show exhibitors started pulling the plug. Trucks delivering exhibits were turned around. Booths were dismantled.

Design and construction work at companies like Access TCA soon came to a halt. At Access, layoffs and furloughs started within weeks: 22 people on March 12, then 20 staffers in Las Vegas, the nation’s capital city of trade shows, effectively putting the Vegas office into hibernation. Several smaller rounds followed. Each time, Sondrup thought she had cut her staff to the core. But then her finance manager would tell her she had to go deeper if she wanted to keep the company alive.

On the morning of April 3, Sondrup and her HR team went to the mammoth shop and warehouse where exhibits were built and stored, an almost 200,000 square-foot area at the far end of the building. The 50 shop workers knew why she was there.

Sondrup felt defeated as she stood on the worn concrete floor in front of a carpenter’s bench, an American flag and posters of retired employees hanging from the rafters nearby.

We’re initiating a relatively large-scale furlough, she told them, choking up as she spoke. We have to act swiftly if we’re going to survive.

The crew was quiet. Heat blew down from the ceiling ducts in gusts.

Rick Colarusso, an Access carpenter for 18 years, hugged her and told her he loved her. We’ll be back, he said.

By noon, the shop was empty.

Help came shortly in the form of a $2.9 million federal Paycheck Protection Program loan. Almost everyone went back on the payroll: designers who dreamed up high-tech exhibits, carpenters who built them, warehouse workers who crated and shipped them, client services staff who traveled with them all over the world.

It was enough to pay everyone through spring. By then, Sondrup thought, the world might almost be back to normal, or close enough, at least, for work to resume.

But as the weeks ticked by and restrictions showed few signs of lifting, Sondrup’s hopes dimmed. In mid-May, with the loan money nearly gone, she called the company-wide Zoom meeting to announce the gut-wrenching decisions she’d made.

She looked into the faces watching her from her computer screen and cut to the chase.

Look, here’s what we know, she said. We know there are no live shows on the calendar for the rest of the year. And that means we’re going to have to do another furlough.

One hundred and twenty-five of her 175 employees would be let go.

She called it a furlough because she didn’t want it to be, didn’t believe it to be, permanent.

I’m doing this, she told them, so there’s a company to bring you back to.

But there was no telling when or how her business would return. Before the pandemic hit last year, Access TCA had been on track to bring in an all-time high of $75 million in revenue. The revised figure after massive cancellations — and a pivot to virtual exhibits — turned out to be closer to $17 million. And 2021? No one knew. Some small shows are in the works for later this year, but industry experts say the big international expos that could revive a company like Sondrup’s aren’t likely to be back to full steam for another two years.

The 50 employees who remain on the job, people Sondrup calls “Swiss army” workers because they can perform multiple duties, are now largely consolidated on the third floor in one corner of the giant, otherwise mostly deserted complex. Many of them work reduced hours, making half or a quarter of their usual pay.

Sondrup couldn’t bear walking past all the empty desks outside her office on the first floor, so she asked three employees to move her desk— a massive steel welding table her father had topped with glass — to be closer to the others.

She keeps tabs on some of the employees she had to let go, particularly the ones in need. She put a number of them on the payroll at minimal hours, allowing their families to remain on the company’s health insurance on Access’s dime.

On company-wide Zoom calls every other Monday, she assures them she can right the ship. But there are some days when she just can’t — can’t be strong, can’t tell everyone it’s going to be OK.

She frets about what seem to her to be haphazard restrictions that allow shopping malls to remain open but cut off trade shows and similar corporate events. By one industry estimate, 50,000 people in Massachusetts’ business events workforce have been laid off and $250 million a month is being drained from the state’s economy. A nationwide study found that nearly 40 percent of business-events companies are at risk of going under.

The emotional exhaustion has driven Sondrup to take naps for the first time in her adult life. On stressful days, she drives 45 minutes to visit her young nieces and momentarily forget her troubles while they play with Barbies or watch “Moana.”

Sondrup believes the tide could finally be turning. Several clients have asked Access to build booths for shows in late summer, boosting several employees back up to full time, and a second PPP loan is awaiting approval.

But she often thinks of the Zoom call she held back in May, when she announced the layoffs and saw the hurt and fear in her employees’ eyes up close. There were husbands and wives who were now both unemployed; fathers and sons. Sondrup had locked eyes with one woman who had been at the company for 20 years. Sondrup used to sell her Girl Scout cookies and take candy off her desk. Now Sondrup was telling her that her livelihood, at least for now, was gone.

When the meeting was over, Sondrup felt shaky and slightly nauseous. Then relieved that it was over. She was glad to be alone. She made herself a sandwich, watched some Food Network, and took a nap.

When she woke, she wrote down the names of employees and their skills on brightly-colored sticky notes and started moving them around on the wall, imagining a company that would survive and one day thrive again.

She would hire back the people she lost. She had to find a way.

At the time, in mid-2018, the public was only becoming aware of what immigration lawyers along the US-Mexico border had long suspected: The US government was splitting migrant families apart not by incompetence or chance but as a matter of policy, a form of deterrence , as then Attorney General Jeff Sessions described it, to discourage others from coming north.

While Gonzalez-Garcia was shuffled from immigration facility to immigration facility, her daughter managed to call her grandmother in Guatemala from a shelter in Texas. The mother tried to connect with the girl by phone, and was able to reach an acquaintance willing to house them in Massachusetts. When Gonzalez-Garcia was released in Colorado, a social worker guided her to the airport for a flight to Boston.

Yet, no one — not the federal officials, the asylum officers, or the advocates — could tell her how to get the government to return her daughter.

President Biden this month created a task force to reunite hundreds of families separated under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy over the past three years. Immigrant lawyers and advocates who have long worked to reunify the families see some hope in the change of direction. But Gonzalez-Garcia’s case provides a window into the immense challenges as Biden administration officials try to reverse the legacy of what many call a stain on the nation’s history. Once families are separated and scattered, getting them back together is an epic challenge — and many such heart-rending cases remain.

The first signs of hope in Gonzalez-Garcia’s long journey came with the phone call that summer night in 2018, from a stranger who insisted she let him stop by. As director of the Metrowest Worker Center, Diego Low focused on labor rights. But the Trump years had thrust organizations like his into new forms of advocacy as federal immigration vans became common sights in Framingham’s immigrant neighborhoods, and people pushed back against what they saw as harassment.

“He told me he wanted to help me, and I wasn’t sure I could believe him,” Gonzalez-Garcia said. “I told him I didn’t trust anybody.”

But with no other options, she agreed to Low’s visit. He went over her rights and texted immigration lawyer Susan Church about the case. He called a female pastor who let Gonzalez-Garcia move in with her over the next two weeks. The next day, Church called the federal agency housing migrant children, thinking the case would be open and shut. Gonzalez-Garcia had all the right paperwork and had pictures of her daughter on her phone. The Globe is not naming the child at the request of her mother as their cases remain pending.

But Church was met with a barrage of questions. Shelter officials seemed to doubt Gonzalez-Garcia could prove the young girl was indeed her child, Church said. They wanted a fresh set of fingerprints, even though the mother had twice been fingerprinted in detention. The first available appointment to get printed wouldn’t be for a month and was in New York City.

As a parent and a lawyer, Church was incensed. “I can’t remember feeling that level of rage in my life,” she said.

Trump administration officials launched their “zero tolerance” policy along parts of the border as early as July 2017 and formally implemented it along the border in April 2018. It required all adults who crossed the border illegally to be taken into the custody of US marshals and face prosecution for what was a misdemeanor crime. With their parents behind bars, government officials alleged, children had to be funneled into shelters, camps, and other facilities under the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which until then had been charged with the care of children traveling into the United States without their parents.

But the American Civil Liberties Union in February 2018 had filed what would become the first major class-action lawsuit representing migrant parents across the country. As the separations multiplied and chaos ensued, informal networks of immigration lawyers and private attorneys, immigrant rights advocates and volunteers scrambled to reunite adults and children who had been haphazardly shuffled across the country.

Reunification demanded equal measures of luck and ingenuity, lawyers said.

Members of the Texas Civil Rights Project surveyed detainees brought into Texas courtrooms along the border, taking the information of those who reported having been separated from their children.

In shelters in New York, where ultimately 400 children landed, staffers with the Unaccompanied Minors Program at Catholic Charities Community Services repeatedly plugged in children’s assigned “alien” numbers into an immigrant detainee locator website, varying the last two digits in hopes of drawing a match with their parents.

“We would try to find parents,” said Anthony Enriquez, the program’s director. “But one of the hallmarks of this whole policy was the total lack of coordination between any of the agencies, so the parents really slipped through a black hole.”

Back in Boston, Church enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the Nixon Peabody law firm, and the offices of Representative Katherine Clark and then Representative Joe Kennedy III. The two called various federal immigration agencies over Fourth of July weekend. They managed to get Gonzalez-Garcia an earlier appointment.

At the same time, she filed the first complaint in Massachusetts against the Trump administration over the separations. According to her complaint, she and her daughter, listed simply as “S.K,” arrived at an Arizona detention center around May 9, 2018, and formally pleaded for asylum, citing domestic violence, abuse, and discrimination.

The day after their arrival, when Gonzalez-Garcia learned Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials planned to take her daughter away, an agent asked her if they celebrated Mother’s Day in her home country, she recalled. When she said they did, he mockingly wished her “a Happy Mother’s Day.”

“He didn’t explain anything to me — not how they were going to take her, not where they were going to take her,” Gonzalez-Garcia said.

The next day, she and other mothers were roused near 5 a.m. and taken to a trailer, where two at a time they were ordered to bathe their children and dress them in government-issued shirts, jackets, and pants. Gonzalez-Garcia whispered with the other women as they waited, speculating about where their children might be taken.

She wept as she washed her daughter’s hair, glancing at the door, wishing for a way to escape, she said. As they lined up the children to march them out, she tried to rush over to her daughter to give her one last kiss goodbye, she said, but an officer stopped her.

“I always kissed her goodnight, goodbye,” she said. “On the bus, I was later told, she cried and cried, and no one could console her.”

President Trump finally caved in the face of international outrage and rolled back the family separation policy in June 2018. By then, the ACLU’s case was giving way to what would become a steering committee with members of nonprofits, including the ACLU, Kids in Need of Defense, and Women’s Refugee Commission, to assist the government in bringing families back together, but its members said their efforts were more often met with resistance from the government.

Federal officials slow walked the handover of information that could have helped speed the identification and location of parents, and the data they did provide was frequently out of date, attorneys said.

In all, at least 5,500 children have been separated since July 2017. More than 600 parents of those children have still not been found. Attorneys estimate that at least 1,000 families were separated even after a federal judge in California halted the practice, as federal officials cited alleged doubts over whether the adults actually were the children’s parents. They also cited previous criminal charges, cases that were often years old, that had never resulted in conviction, and often involved minor offenses like littering or trespassing.

“These were things that in a domestic family court would not be reasonable grounds to separate a family,” said Leah Chavla, a senior policy adviser at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

Social workers had a particularly hard time connecting parents with babies and toddlers who couldn’t verbalize who their parents were. Other children struggled to speak through their trauma. Church had one teenage client who watched officers wrestle his younger sister from his mother as he banged on a window begging them to stop.

Another lawyer, Catherine Weiss with the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, represented a father whose daughter, then 4, was ripped from his arms after agents woke them up near 3 a.m. as they slept on a mat in a McAllen, Texas, processing center. In a separate case, adults and children were loaded onto different buses parked next to each other.

“The children kept trying to crawl out the windows,” Weiss said, her voice catching. “The mom who was in the other bus watched them scream and claw for half an hour.”

When Biden signed the executive order forming the task force, he called it the first action “to undo the moral and national shame” after the Trump administration separated families without a plan to ever reunify them. The task force will have to provide a thorough count of all children separated between Jan. 20, 2017, and Jan. 20, 2021, and issue a series of reports and recommendations on legal remedies, presidential actions, and additional social and mental health services that could facilitate the reunification of every family.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Latino and immigrant to lead the agency, will head the task force. He has promised to reunite the families, no matter how hard it proves.

“I am a father. I am a husband. I am a son. I am a brother,” he told CNN. “I have not heard before a pain as acute and heartbreaking as that.”

Lawyers and advocates on the front lines appreciate the shift in tone but wonder what more the government can do when they’ve already exhausted so many avenues, and a pandemic and deadly hurricanes have all but stopped searches for deported parents in several Latin American countries.

But they hope the task force might be able to churn up new information, perhaps even records not before disclosed. They want the government to provide redress to help make families whole. More than anything, they want officials to act with urgency — not only to reunite families but to ensure a crisis like this does not happen again.

“I have been living these cases day and night for three years,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer in the family separation lawsuits. “I welcome the commitment to righting this wrong. But I am concerned that there are not enough details.”

In July 2018 — after Gonzalez-Garcia and her daughter had spent nearly two months apart — the federal government began to release some children, as it faced a looming court order and multiple lawsuits, including at least four filed by women in Massachusetts. Her daughter was one of those released. The video clips went viral, of Gonzalez-Garcia dropping to her knees, flanked by Clark, Low, and Church, as her daughter burst into a room at Logan Airport.

“Forgive me, my child, forgive me,” she sobbed as the two embraced.

Clark called it one of the most heart-wrenching moments of her life.

“Even though her situation, her life experience, couldn’t be more different from mine, that universal love of our children and wanting them to have a fair shot, opportunity, were really represented for me in Angelica,” she said.

People watched the reunion between Gonzalez-Garcia and her daughter with joy. But while it seems the world has moved on, she said every day is a battle for them.

She followed the November election and the Jan. 6 insurrection in anguish over what it could mean for the fate of her and her daughter, who have tried to make their home in Framingham. Biden’s words have brought some relief, but Gonzalez-Garcia still lives in fear of deportation and racism. Her daughter, now 10, wakes up in terror screaming in the middle of the night.

“Sometimes, she cries and tells me she wants to leave, and that the people here are mean, and I start to think that maybe we should flee to another country,” Gonzalez-Garcia said. “But I’ve fought so much, and I try to explain the best I can, that our lives are going to be better here.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the time period that the task force will review to provide a thorough count of all children separated from their families. It is between Jan. 20, 2017, and Jan. 20, 2021.

Abigail Kohler is co-founder and chief executive of ResusciTech , a Providence-based startup that recently developed an app that brings first aid and CPR training and certification to iOS and Android platforms, without additional equipment needed.

The Boston Globe’s weekly Ocean State Innovators column features a Q&A with Rhode Island innovators who are starting new businesses and nonprofits, conducting groundbreaking research, and reshaping the state’s economy. Send tips and suggestions to reporter Edward Fitzpatrick at edward.fitzpatrick@globe.com and to Alexa Gagosz at alexa.gagosz@globe.com

Kohler: My cofounder, Greg Fine, and I started ResusciTech in October of 2018 when we were both juniors at Brown. At the time, I was taking a medical illustration class that gave me the opportunity to do observations in hospitals. While observing, I overheard an EMT talking about how difficult it is to do CPR because it’s challenging to gauge compression depth.

We then relied on our engineering backgrounds and began to develop a solution: software that can measure chest compression depth and rate all from a smartphone. Our continued research brought us to a CPR training class, where we realized we could use our technology to make significant improvements and bring CPR training into the 21st century.

Q: Why should people turn to your new app instead of getting CPR certified in more-traditional ways?

Kohler: Our app is far more convenient and accessible than traditional classes, without sacrificing quality. We combine the best that e-learning has to offer with the hands-on component of CPR feedback so that you have an engaging and fruitful learning experience. We leverage smartphones to bring interactive CPR training straight to you, without added costs, equipment, wasted time, or dull lectures like traditional classes. Our technology modernizes CPR training and enables completely remote CPR certification.

Q: Tell us about how the Smart Certification app works.

Kohler: After downloading the app, users can create an account and start learning for free. Users then complete interactive education sessions and learn basic first aid, AED use, and CPR. Then, they can practice their chest compressions with real time feedback.

To do this, users hold their phones while performing chest compressions on a household object like a couch cushion. We use the sensors that are already in your phone to measure and analyze the compressions you perform. In real time, the phone provides audio feedback and visual feedback to guide you and correct your compressions, proving your capability and giving you confidence.

After this, users can decide whether or not to purchase a certificate, and then they are done! We give users the opportunity to learn completely free of charge on our platform.

Q: You were recently named a finalist in the American Heart Association’s Empowered to Serve 2020 Business Accelerator, where you received a $40,000 grant for your work to train more people in hands-on CPR. What will that grant go toward?

Kohler: One of the first things we are going to do is get our app translated in multiple languages. Currently, it is only in English, but by having it translated we will be able to improve accessibility and bring life-saving training to more communities.

Beyond that, we are going to use it to improve awareness and create communities prepared for cardiac emergencies. We are planning to start some exciting initiatives to get users more involved and eager to become advocates for CPR knowledge in their own communities.

Advertisement

Q: What are some of the biggest challenges that ResusciTech faces right now, and how will you address them?

Kohler: Right now we are gearing up for our public launch of the app this month. We have been beta testing, iterating, and improving past versions for months and I’m excited to launch it to the public. That being said, the shift from distribution of the app being controlled to being widely available on the app store is a daunting one. Our biggest challenge right now is trying to make sure we see and mitigate every potential pitfall before it happens and ensure that our launch goes smoothly.

Q: What are some goals that you and your team have for the next year? What about for the next five years?

Kohler: In the next year we are planning to develop several partnerships with businesses and even with local nonprofits who have a strong alignment with our mission. We are also planning to begin the necessary research and tests required to apply for FDA clearance so that our CPR feedback software is suitable for use on people during real emergencies. We also plan to expand our team and bring on people to conduct sales and manage our partnerships.

In the next five years our largest goal is to obtain FDA clearance on our CPR feedback software for use during real emergencies. Additionally, we plan to expand our training offerings to provide remote solutions for other types of medical training.

We have been cleaning up after violent white supremacist mobs for generations, and it must end.”

US Representative Ayanna Pressley reflected on the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and called for the country to “address the evil and scourge that is white supremacy in this nation” during a CNN interview Sunday , two days before former president Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial before the Senate is set to begin.

Pressley, appearing on “State of the Union” with host Jake Tapper, said the nation has already “been turning the page” from the Capitol attack last month. She described the “harrowing [and] traumatic” siege that forced lawmakers and their staffs into hiding as the mob smashed through windows and entered the building, many carrying “Trump 2020" flags and symbols of white supremacist groups.

“Let me just say this for those that continue to feign great surprise about what happened on Jan. 6. As a Black woman, to be barricaded in my office, using office furniture and water bottles, on the ground, in the dark, that terror, those moments of terror, is familiar in a deep and ancestral way for me,” she said.

“And I want us to do everything to ensure that a breach like this never occurs at the Capitol, but I want us to address the evil and scourge that is white supremacy in this nation. This is not only about securing the Capitol to ensure that members and our staffs, and custodial staff, and food service workers are safe in the Capitol. It is that we are safe in America.”

Tapper asked Pressley if she feels secure going to work.

“I feel safe,” she said. “Living with threats, and living with bigots who are as vile in their rhetoric as they are in the policies that they seek and enact, and the harm that they seek to cause the most marginalized communities, Black Americans in particular, is not new.”

Democrats and nonpartisan observers have accused Trump of inciting the attack, which followed a rally in front of the White House where the then-president urged his supporters to “fight like hell.” In a court filing last week, Trump’s lawyers denied that his words “had anything to do with the action at the Capitol.”

Pressley called on the Senate to hold Trump accountable for his role in the insurrection and his repeated false claims that he won the November election.

“If we really believe that this is a moment of reckoning in every way, then we must act accordingly,” she said. “And that means that Donald J. Trump must be held accountable because he is culpable for having incited this insurrection by perpetuating this big lie.

“This House has twice done its job,” Pressley continued. “He will forever be the twice-impeached president by this Democratic-majority-led House. And now the Senate must honor their oath and impeach Donald J. Trump to hold him accountable, but also to bar him from running for public office ever again.”

“I remember after that win, I was so done,” Gronkowski recalled Sunday. “Coming off the field, I was like, ‘I’m just glad it’s over,’ with the pain I was in. It was great to be a champ, but it just felt great to be done.”

When tight end Rob Gronkowski walked off the field after winning Super Bowl LIII two years ago, he told himself wasn’t coming back to the Patriots — or to football.

But quarterback Tom Brady, after signing with Tampa Bay Buccaneers this offseason, managed to lure his friend and teammate out of retirement, and Super Bowl LV showed why he wanted the fun-loving tight end back on his side.

Gronkowski was Brady’s most popular target against the Kansas City Chiefs, catching six passes for 67 yards and two touchdowns en route to another championship together.

The two made history in the first quarter, setting a record for most touchdowns by any duo in the NFL postseason. With the ball on Kansas City’s 8-yard line, Brady faked a handoff before hitting a wide-open Gronkowski, who ran untouched into the end zone.

The pair, previously tied with the Hall of Fame tandem of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, didn’t waste any time in adding to their new record, scoring again midway through the second quarter.

The Bucs initially settled for a 40-yard field goal on a fourth-and-5 from Kansas City’s 22-yard line, but an offsides penalty gave them a new set of downs. Tampa Bay immediately cashed in on the next play, when Brady found Gronkowski in the back of the end zone for a 17-yard score.

Coach Bruce Arians credited Gronkowski for the adjustment he made to get open. When Brady let go of the ball, Gronkowski had only a yard of separation from Chiefs cornerback L’Jarius Sneed, according to Next Gen Stats. When the pass arrived, he had built 3.8 yards of separation and caught the ball untouched.

“That was huge, man,” Arians said after his team’s decisive 31-9 victory. “That was huge.”

For anyone questioning whether Gronkowski’s still got it after a year away from football, the 31-year-old also showed elite burst off of the line of scrimmage on his second touchdown. According to Next Gen Stats, he reached a top speed of 11.64 miles per hour within 1 second of his route, besting his second-average top speed of 8.42 m.p.h. within 1 second.

With two touchdowns in both Super Bowls LII and LV, Gronkowski joins Rice (Super Bowls XXIV and XXIX) as the only players in NFL history with multiple Super Bowl performances with at least two touchdown receptions. Gronkowski now has four multi-touchdown postseason performances.

Gronkowski also moved ahead of former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver John Stallworth for the second-most number of receiving touchdowns in NFL postseason history. Rice sits in first, with 22.

His impact wasn’t limited to just touchdowns, though.

In the final minute of the second quarter, Gronkowski powered his way to a first down on a critical third-and-2. Trailing 14-6, the Chiefs had utilized two of their timeouts in an effort to preserve the clock should they get the ball back. But Gronkowski thwarted their plans, catching a short pass from Brady and powering his way to the first-down marker.

Later, in the third quarter, Gronkowski’s first target of the second half generated a gain of 25 yards. For a moment, it seemed as if he was on his way to his third touchdown of the game, with an open field ahead, but Chiefs safety Juan Thornhill managed to grab his ankles.

On Tampa Bay’s very next play, Gronkowski levied a key block to set up running back Leonard Fournette’s 27-yard touchdown run, giving the Bucs a 28-9 lead.

Gronkowski’s lone miss came on a long ball on third-and-1 in the fourth quarter.

“Whoever got the ball, got the ball,” Gronkowski said. “We were all happy for each other. We knew that we were all going to have to play together and work together in order to win the game. That’s what we did. That’s what we did all year long.

“That’s what was so great about being with this team. There was no one that was selfish. It just happened to me this time, to be me making the plays, to have the touchdown passes thrown to me.”

Prior to reuniting in Tampa Bay this season, Gronkowski and Brady played together for nine seasons in New England. Gronkowski appeared in four Super Bowls with the Patriots, earning three rings while missing one game (LI) with a back injury.

So, how does it feel to do it again in Tampa?

“It definitely ranks as one of my greatest accomplishments ever,” Gronkowski said. “It’s just an unbelievable story.

Oh, and as for whether he’ll be playing again next year? Gronkowski, who signed a one-year deal, is set to hit free agency, but it sure sounds like he’ll be back in Tampa with Brady.

“I definitely see myself coming back,” Gronkowski said. “I don’t see why not.”

As for the flag raising, he’ll take care of that on the opening weekend of the 2021 season.

It’s the rallying cry for Buccaneers fans from Ybor City to Bayshore Gardens and all points in between.

Brady showed he still has plenty of firepower in his arm, throwing three touchdown passes as he riddled a baffled Kansas City defense in a 31-9 victory in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium.

Now the Buccaneers get to raise a championship flag in the fall — the seventh Super Bowl banner Brady has helped lead his teams to during his 21-year career.

When Brady signed as a free agent with Tampa Bay back in the spring, longtime Buccaneers linebacker Lavonte David said, “Everything’s about to change.”

He couldn’t have known just how much.

Brady, who collected his record fifth Super Bowl MVP award, spearheaded the turnaround of a franchise that hadn’t been to the playoffs since 2007 and hadn’t won a postseason game since winning the Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.

“I think we knew this was going to happen, didn’t we guys?” Brady hollered to his teammates from the postgame podium surrounded by his boys, Jack and Ben, and daughter Vivian.

Asked if this was the crowning achievement of his career, whose previous nine trips to the NFL’s ultimate game came with the Patriots, Brady deflected.

“I’m not making any comparisons,” said Brady, as he pointed to his teammates. “These guys are world champions forever and you can never that away from them.”

Later Brady said of his Super Bowl wins, “They’re all special.”

Leonard Fournette said Brady instilled confidence in the Buccaneers all week, including texting them late at night to give them pointers about the Chiefs defense and remind them what to expect during the week of preparations.

“I’m blessed to be with this man,” said Fournette, who was recruited to Tampa by Brady after the running back was released by the Jaguars. “He’s the GOAT. He is the greatest football player of all time and now I get to tell my children I played with him.”

The 43-year-old Brady outdueled young gun Patrick Mahomes, who was under constant pressure from a relentless Tampa Bay pass rush dialed up by defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, who prayed on Chiefs backup tackles Martinas Rankin and Mike Remmers.

Bowles’s counterpart, Kansas City’s Steve Spagnuolo, who has had plenty of success defending Brady in the past, had no answers on this night.

Brady completed 21 of 29 passes for 201 yards and a 125.8 passer rating, the highest of any quarterback in Super Bowl history. Mahomes was the third straight Super Bowl MVP to have his season ended by Brady, who dispatched Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers in the Divisional round and the NFC Championship game.

Brady, who confirmed he’ll be back for season No. 22, also extended his Super Bowl marks for most career competitions (277), passing yards (3,039), and touchdown passes (21).

As he has done so often on these title runs, Brady leaned on swashbuckling buddy Rob Gronkowski early and often. Brady hit his former Patriots tight end teammate six times for 67 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

In his previous nine Super Bowl appearances, Brady had zero first-quarter touchdown drives but he no longer has that ugly statistic on his record.

After two fruitless drives, Brady got the ball for a third time staring at a 3-0 deficit. He quickly led Tampa Bay on a 75-yard drive, hitting all four his passes, the final one a simple 8-yard slip screen to an uncovered Gronkowski for a 7-3 lead. They never trailed again.

Brady continued his brilliant first half by going to Gronkowski again, hitting the big galoot on a 17-yard scoring strike and a 14-3 lead. It appeared as though the Buccaneers would settle for a field goal but an offside on the field goal attempt gave Tampa a first down and Brady made Kansas City pay for giving him an extra chance.

It was the 14th playoff touchdown connection for the pair, the most in NFL history, and their fourth Super Bowl TD, which broke a tie they held with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.

Gronkowski trails only Rice (22) in postseason TD catches. He and Rice are the only players in NFL history with multiple TD catches in multiple Super Bowl games.

“Gronk’s an unbelievable player and teammate,” said Brady.

To put a bow on his terrific first 30 minutes, Brady led a clinical two-minute drive — though he got a huge assist from the Chiefs secondary as two critical calls kept the drive alive.

Brady finished off the lightning march by hitting another former Patriot, Antonio Brown, with a 1-yard TD and a 21-3 lead at intermission.

“Big time players making big time plays,” Brady said of the former New Englanders.

There’s was 30 minutes to go, but it felt like just formality.

Brady controlled the clock and his defense kept Mahomes out of the end zone for the first time in his career to seal the deal.

The grant would provide up to $5,000 to qualifying “first-generation” home buyers who put up $2,500 of their own.

This week, they’re committing some of it to an issue that has long reflected who benefits from the city’s prosperity: homeownership.

Last summer, amid a police overtime scandal and calls to “defund” police following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Martin J. Walsh and the City Council agreed to cut the police overtime budget by $12 million and use that money instead to help address racial disparities in Boston.

It’s part of a larger program launched by the nonprofit Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, which has helped dozens of low- and moderate-income families buy or prepare to buy houses in an increasingly expensive city.

“Now more than ever in Boston, we must take steps to create equitable opportunities and access to resources for all Bostonians,” Walsh said in a statement. “Improving pathways to homeownership can help address disparities in wealth.”

Countless studies have highlighted the wealth gap between white and Black households in Greater Boston, most famously a 2015 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that found the median net worth for white households was $247,500, compared with $8 for Black households.

Much of that gap is driven by homeownership. White households here are almost twice as likely to own their homes as Black households, according to data from the Urban Institute. And given that home prices have more than doubled over the last 20 years, homeowners are far more likely to have accumulated wealth — in the form of home equity — than renters. That can then help pay for college, start a business, or help the next generation of a family buy a home of their own.

The MAHA, based in Dorchester, tries to increase access to that virtuous cycle through an array of homeownership classes and programs. Two years ago, with grants from Boston Children’s Hospital, Wells Fargo and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, the alliance launched the grant program for “first-generation” buyers in Boston. (Distinct from “first-time” buyers, it targets people whose parents do not own a home, or lost one in foreclosure.) It has enrolled 168 people in home-buying prep classes; 14 have bought homes.

The city’s investment will help to expand the program, said Symone Crawford, the alliance’s director of homeownership education.

“First-generation buyers often don’t have enough savings, or family members with the financial resources to tap, when trying to buy a home,” she said. “This investment is critical in helping to level the playing field for those residents to become homeowners.”

The alliance is talking with other potential funders about large investments, as well, said executive director Tom Callahan, and hopes to continue expanding the program. Having City Hall’s backing, he said, should help.

“We have big ambitions, and this is sort of proof of concept,” he said. “Both the stamp of approval and the money itself are really helpful.”

Homeownership, particularly for Black and Latino families that have been shut out, has been a top priority at City Hall in recent years, said Sheila Dillon, Walsh’s chief of housing. Under Walsh, the city has approved tens of thousands of new apartments, much-needed supply that’s part of a broad campaign to rein in housing costs. Officials are seeking to address growing concerns about displacement and the lack of wealth-building opportunities, both of which could be eased by helping families buy houses.

Last year, the city, along with the Massachusetts Housing Partnership and several Boston-area banks, launched an extra-low-interest mortgage program for lower- and middle-income home buyers. When the overtime money became available, $2 million was dedicated to housing and homelessness prevention, and some of that allotment was put into the MAHA’s grant program.

“We’re really trying to double down on creating more affordable homeownership opportunities, and creating better tools to help people buy,” Dillon said.

Of course, the Walsh administration is in its waning days, with City Council President Kim Janey soon to take over as acting mayor as Walsh awaits confirmation as US labor secretary. With a fall election on the horizon, many Boston housing advocates are hopeful that homeownership — particularly for first-time buyers — is high on the list of urgent needs for the next mayor. Callahan said he’s confident that it will be.

“Obviously, the city’s got a lot of priorities,” he said. “But this should be right right up there.”

Not that long ago, we would have been asking something else: Where are the women, and where are the candidates of color?

Meanwhile, promising contenders waiting in the wings are all people of color: John Barros, Karilyn Crockett, and Jon Santiago.

I’m not discouraging white candidates from running, but let’s pause to reflect on this momentous moment in Boston politics.

In 2013, the last time there was an open seat for mayor, there were 12 candidates in the primary, half of them white and only one a woman. Despite the diverse field, the top vote-getters were two guys of Irish heritage: John Connolly and Marty Walsh.

Fast-forward to 2021, and a white male mayoral candidate has become the exception, not the rule. That’s progress, folks, especially in Boston, one of the last major cities in the country yet to elect a woman or a person of color as mayor.

What’s even more progressive: The electorate is not left with token choices but exceptional candidates. Campbell and Wu — both thirtysomething former City Council presidents with Ivy League bona fides — have exuded a fearlessness by launching their campaigns in September to take on a popular incumbent going for his third term.

And it is paying off: Campbell, who is Black, and Wu, who is Asian, have been on a fund-raising tear. Campbell has $743,000 in campaign cash on hand, while Wu has $741,000.

Still, this might not dissuade white men from entering the race. President Biden’s nomination of Walsh to be US labor secretary, in the first week of January, set off a flurry of speculation about who else might get into the mayoral race. A handful of white male candidates have been mentioned — including state Representative Aaron Michlewitz of the North End and City Councilor Michael Flaherty — but neither are pursuing the post.

So far, one white man has filed papers to run: Dana Depelteau of Dorchester. And another might still be in the hunt: state Senator Nick Collins of South Boston. But I wouldn’t be surprised if somewhere in Boston there are other white men thinking that history is on their side.

“If every mayor has been a white guy, it stands to reason another could win in 2021,” said Erin O’Brien, a University of Massachusetts Boston professor who studies gender in politics.

The irony is that a white male candidate would stand out in a field dominated by women and men of color. But it could be a painful campaign to watch, one never-ending game of political Twister in explaining how he’s the one who can eliminate racial inequities after a pandemic that has disproportionately hurt Black and brown communities.

I asked O’Brien what advice she would give white male candidates exploring a bid.

“I wouldn’t give them any advice. I would say, ‘Don’t do it,’ "" she said. “The tide has finally turned where much of Boston doesn’t believe it is their moment.”

One political operative told me it’s possible for a white male candidate with deep pockets to make it to the general election in November, perhaps by painting himself as a centrist with business community support. Even so, this operative couldn’t see a white man, in this moment of racial reckoning, winning it all.

Boston may be a majority-minority city, with only about 45 percent of its population white, but based on past local elections, white people show up at the polls more frequently than voters of color. In 2013, about 59 percent of those who cast votes in the general election were white, according to an analysis by the MassINC Polling Group.

Political observers believe that pattern will change in 2021, because a strong slate of candidates of color will draw more-diverse voters and participation is expected to increase with more voting by mail. Those dynamics could help pave the way for Boston to elect someone other than a white man.

Charlotte Golar Richie — who is Black and was the lone woman in the 2013 mayoral race — reminded me that candidates and their supporters back then recognized the importance of representation.

“What is different this time,” she wrote in an e-mail, “is that the election of a person of color may actually happen!”

Boston has come a long way since 2013. This mayoral race will show us just how far.

But when the trial opens Tuesday at the very scene of the invasion, the prosecutors will try to force senators who lived through the deadly rampage as they met to formalize President Joe Biden’s election victory to reckon with the totality of Trump’s monthslong drive to overturn the election and his failure to call off the assault.

Armed with lessons from Trump’s first impeachment trial, which even Democrats complained was repetitive and sometimes sanctimonious, the prosecutors managing his second are prepared to conclude in as little as a week, forgo distracting witness fights and rely heavily on video, according to six people working on the case.

WASHINGTON — When House impeachment managers prosecute former President Donald Trump this week for inciting the Capitol attack, they plan to mount a fast-paced and cinematic case aimed at rekindling the outrage lawmakers experienced on Jan. 6.

“The story of the president’s actions is both riveting and horrifying,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the lead prosecutor, said in an interview. “We think that every American should be aware of what happened — that the reason he was impeached by the House and the reason he should be convicted and disqualified from holding future federal office is to make sure that such an attack on our democracy and Constitution never happens again.”

In making Trump the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, Democrats have essentially given themselves an unprecedented do-over. When Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., was preparing to prosecute Trump the first time for a pressure campaign on Ukraine, he read the 605-page record of President Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial cover to cover, sending aides as many as 20 dispatches a day as he sought to modernize a proceeding that had happened only twice before.

Advertisement

This time, a new group of nine Democratic managers need reach back only a year to study the lessons of Schiff’s prosecution: Don’t antagonize Republicans, use lots and lots of video and, above all, make succinct arguments to avoid lulling the jury of lawmakers into boredom or distraction.

Trump’s lawyers have indicated that they once again intend to mount a largely technical defense, contending that the Senate “lacks jurisdiction” to judge a former president after he has left office because the Constitution does not explicitly say it can. Though many legal scholars and a majority of the Senate disagree, Republicans have flocked to the argument in droves as a justification for dismissing the case without weighing in on Trump’s conduct.

But the lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr. and David Schoen, also plan to deny that Trump incited the violence or intended to interfere with Congress formalizing Biden’s victory, asserting that his baseless claims that the election was “stolen” are protected by the First Amendment. And Castor told Fox News that he, too, would rely on video, possibly of unrest in American cities led by Democrats.

The managers will try to rebut them as much with constitutional arguments as an overwhelming compendium of evidence. Raskin’s team has spent dozens of hours culling a deep trove of videos captured by the mob, Trump’s own unvarnished words and criminal pleas from rioters who said they acted at the former president’s behest.

The primary source material may replace live testimony. Trying to call new witnesses has been the subject of an extended debate by the managers, whose evidentiary record has several holes that White House or military officials could conceivably fill. At the last trial, Democrats made an unsuccessful push for witnesses a centerpiece of their case, but this time, many in the party say they are unnecessary to prove the charge and would simply cost Biden precious time to move his agenda without changing the outcome.

“It’s not that there should not be witnesses; it’s just the practical realities of where we are with a former president,” said Daniel S. Goldman, a former House lawyer who worked on Trump’s first impeachment. “This is also something that we learned from the last trial: This is a political animal, and these witnesses are not going to move the needle.”

Raskin and other managers declined to speak about strategy, but current and former officials familiar with the confidential preparations agreed to discuss them anonymously. The prosecutors’ almost complete silence in the runup to the trial has been another departure from the strategy of Trump’s first impeachment, when Democrats set up a sizable communications war room in the Capitol and saturated cable television airwaves in an all-out battle against Trump in the court of public opinion.

They have largely left it to trusted allies like Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to publicly discuss their case and bat back criticism about why the House is pressing its case even now that Trump is out of office.

“If we were not to follow up with this, we might as well remove any penalty from the Constitution of impeachment — just take it out,” Pelosi told reporters who questioned why Democrats would consume so much of Congress’ time with a former president.

Key questions about the scope and shape of the trial remain unsettled. Senators spent the weekend haggling over the precise structure and rules of the proceeding, the first time in American history a former president will be put on trial.

Prosecutors and Trump’s defense lawyers expected to have at least 12 hours each to make their case. Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, has been coaching his colleagues in daily meetings to aggressively winnow down their arguments, cling to narrative where possible and integrate them with the visual aids they plan to display on TVs in the Senate chamber and on screens across the country.

Behind the scenes, Democrats are relying on many of the same lawyers and aides who helped assemble the 2020 case, including Susanne Sachsman Grooms from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and Aaron Hiller, Arya Hariharan, Sarah Istel and Amy Rutkin from the Judiciary Committee. The House also temporarily called back Barry H. Berke, a seasoned New York defense lawyer, to serve as chief counsel and Joshua Matz, a constitutional expert.

Schiff said his team had tried to produce an “HBO miniseries” featuring clips of witness testimony to bring to life the esoteric plot about Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine. Raskin’s may appear more like a blockbuster action film.

“The more you document all the tragic events leading up to that day and the president’s misconduct on that day and the president’s reaction while people were being attacked that day, the more and more difficult you make it for any senator to hide behind those false constitutional fig leaves,” said Schiff, who has informally advised the managers.

To assemble the presentation, Raskin’s team has turned to the same outside firm that helped put together Schiff’s multimedia display. But Raskin is working with vastly richer material to tell a monthslong story of how he and his colleagues believe Trump seeded, gathered and provoked a mob to try to overturn his defeat.

There are clips and tweets of Trump from last summer, warning he would only lose if the election was “rigged” against him; clips and tweets of him claiming victory after his loss; and clips and tweets of state officials coming to the White House as he sought to “stop the steal.” There is audio of a call in which Trump pressured Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” the votes needed to reverse Biden’s victory there; as well as presidential tweets and accounts by sympathetic lawmakers who say that once those efforts failed, Trump decisively turned his attention to the Jan. 6 meeting of Congress for one last stand.

At the center is footage of Trump, speaking outside the White House hours before the mob overtook the police and invaded the Capitol building. The managers’ pretrial brief suggests they are planning to juxtapose footage of Trump urging his supporters to “fight like hell” and march to the Capitol and confront Congress with videos posted from members of the crowd who can be heard processing his words in real time.

“Even with this trial, where senators themselves were witnesses, it’s very important to tell the whole story,” Schiff said. “This is not about a single day; it is about a course of conduct by a president to use his office to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power.”

But the proximity could also create complications. Several people familiar with the preparations said the managers were wary of saying anything that might implicate Republican lawmakers who echoed or entertained the president’s baseless claims of election fraud. To have any chance of making an effective case, the managers believe, they must make clear it is Trump who is on trial, not his party.",Impeachment case aims to marshal outrage of Capitol attack against Trump

The decision is likely to draw criticism from conservative lawmakers and many in the pro-Israel community.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is set to announce this week that it will reengage with the much-maligned U.N. Human Rights Council that former President Donald Trump withdrew from almost three years ago, U.S. officials said. The decision reverses another Trump-era move away from multilateral organizations and agreements.

Trump pulled out of the world body's main human rights agency in 2018 due to its disproportionate focus on Israel, which has received by far the largest number of critical council resolutions against any country, as well as the number of authoritarian countries among its members and because it failed to meet an extensive list of reforms demanded by then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.

In addition to the council’s persistent focus on Israel, the Trump administration took issue with the body’s membership, which currently includes China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russia and Venezuela, all of which have been accused of human rights abuses.

One senior U.S. official said the Biden administration believed the council must still reform but that the best way to promote change is to “engage with it in a principled fashion.” The official said it can be “an important forum for those fighting tyranny and injustice around the world” and the U.S. presence intends to ""ensure it can live up to that potential.”

That official and three others familiar with the decision were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the announcement, and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Although the U.S. will have only nonvoting observer status on the council through the end of 2021, the officials said the administration intends to seek one of three full member seats — currently held by Austria, Denmark and Italy — from the “Western Europe and other states group” that come up for election later this year.

The U.N. General Assembly makes the final choice in a vote that generally takes place in October every year to fill vacancies in three-year terms at the 47-member-state council.

U.S. engagement with the council and its predecessor, the U.N. Human Rights Commission, has been something of a political football between Republican and Democratic administrations for decades. While recognizing its shortcomings, Democratic presidents have tended to want a seat at the table while Republicans have recoiled at its criticism of Israel.

Trump's withdrawal from the UNHRC, however, was one of a number of U.S. retrenchments from the international community during his four years in office. He also walked away from the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the World Health Organization, U.N. education and cultural organization, UNESCO, and several arms-control treaties. Trump also threatened to withdraw from the International Postal Union and frequently hinted at pulling out of the World Trade Organization.

Since taking office last month, President Joe Biden has rejoined both the Paris accord and the WHO and has signaled interest in returning to the Iran deal as well as UNESCO.

The draft 22-page provision, reported earlier by The Washington Post and obtained by The New York Times, is expected to be formally introduced Monday as lawmakers race to fill out the contours of Biden’s stimulus plan.

WASHINGTON — Top House Democrats are preparing to unveil legislation that would send up to $3,600 per child to millions of Americans, as lawmakers aim to change the tax code to target child poverty rates as part of President Joe Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

“The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it’s devastating,” said Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, chair of the Ways and Means Committee and one of the champions of the provision. “This money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone’s head or food on their table. This is how the tax code is supposed to work for those who need it most.”

The credits would be split into monthly payments from the IRS beginning in July, based on a person’s or family’s income in 2020. Although the proposed credit is only for a year, some Democrats said they would fight to make it permanent, a sweeping move that could reshape efforts to fight child poverty in America.

The one-year credit appears likely to garner enough support to be included in the stimulus package, but it will also have to clear a series of tough parliamentary hurdles because of the procedural maneuvers Democrats are using to muscle the stimulus package through, potentially without Republican support.

With House Democratic leadership aiming to have the stimulus legislation approved on the chamber floor by the end of the month, Congress moved last week to fast-track Biden’s stimulus plan even as details of the legislation are still being worked out. Buoyed by support from Democrats in both chambers and a lackluster January jobs report, Biden has warned that he plans to move ahead with his plan whether or not Republicans support it.

Republicans, who have accused Biden of abandoning promises of bipartisanship and raised concerns about the nation’s debt, have largely balked at his plan because of its size and scope after Congress approved trillions of dollars in economic relief in 2020.

But the child tax credit could provide an opportunity for some bipartisan support, since Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, introduced a similar measure that would send payments of up to $1,250 per month to families with children. Romney’s proposal, intended to encourage Americans to have more children while reducing child poverty rates, would distribute payments through the Social Security Administration and offset costs by eliminating other government safety net spending.

“If you’re President Biden, and you’re serious about having a bipartisan — working together with people on the other side, bringing people together in unity, he has the opportunity to do it,” Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” (Toomey has said he would not support Biden’s proposal because of the price tag.)

Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, warned Sunday that the United States labor market was stalling and in a “deep hole” that could take years to emerge from if lawmakers did not quickly pass the stimulus package.

Yellen rebutted concerns that big spending would lead to inflation and said the economy would face the kind of long, slow recovery that it experienced after the 2008 financial crisis if lawmakers did too little.

“The most important risk is that we leave workers and communities scarred by the pandemic and the economic toll that it’s taken,” Yellen said on CNN. “We have to make sure this doesn’t take a permanent toll on their lives.”

Yellen said that passing the stimulus package could allow the economy to reach full employment by next year. Failing to do so, she said, could leave the jobless rate elevated for years to come.

The provision expanding the child tax credit is among the legislative proposals intended to address the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic and help families weather the nation’s faltering economy. Researchers at Columbia University found that Biden’s overall stimulus proposal could cut child poverty in half in 2021 because of the expansion of the child credit, as well as other changes to tax credits and expansions of unemployment and food assistance benefits.

“The moment is here to make dramatic cuts in child poverty that could improve the lives and the future of millions of children,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said Sunday. She said she would push to make the credit permanent.","Democrats, including Representative Neal, to unveil up to $3,600 child tax credit as part of stimulus bill"

Lee had been skating for a little over a year, but often found herself being the only woman at skateparks. Tate had always been interested in skating, but felt she didn’t know where to start.

Northeastern students Claire Lee, Rayven Tate, and Becca Brichacek were tired of seeing the same types of people in Boston’s skateboarding scene.

Founded last summer, the Boston-based collective (previously named LonelyGrl Skate Co.) aims to provide a safe space and create representation for skaters who don’t fit the “typical skater” archetype.

“[LonelyBones is for] women skaters, but also trans people and gender-nonconforming skaters, as well as BIPOC and disabled skaters,” Lee said. Or, as she explained, anyone from a community outside of the historical assumption of who a skater is: a white cishet man.

According to Tate, the skateboarding community can be cliquey and judgmental: “I think it’s important to show that you can start from anywhere as long as you just have the push to buy a board.”

Brichacek, who had a childhood interest in skating, was drawn to the mission of LonelyBones and joined as the collective’s primary photographer after coming across a post of Lee’s on social media.

LonelyBones Skate Co. founders Rayven Tate, Claire Lee, and Becca Brichacek Becca Brichacek

LonelyBones’ community is mainly housed on Instagram, where they have over 3,000 followers, and on Discord, a messaging platform where skaters can chat casually, sell or trade gear and share tricks, and plan meetups. “People are really supportive,” Brichacek adds.

Most of their Instagram posts are photos of collective members in action, taken at meetups or submitted. They use the page to promote meetups, sell stickers, and support their mission and social justice causes.

Their monthly socially distanced meetups take place in Boston area parks, with mask wearing strictly enforced. Their next meetup is scheduled for the end of February at the Allston Pump Track, and details will be posted on their Instagram the week before.

Each meetup draws 50 to 70 people, with skaters — on boards and roller skates — coming from as far as Vermont and Rhode Island. Most of the attendees are 18 to 24 years old, and they foster a diverse community. The meetups are unstructured, for people of all skill levels, and designed to be a productive and encouraging learning environment.

“It’s really a safe space for anyone who wants to learn to talk to each other and say, ‘Oh hey, can you show me how you’re doing that?’ or ‘Can we set up a time where you could help me out?’” Brichacek said. “It’s really cool seeing people who have met at the meetups, come to more meetups, and become friends over time.”

Part of LonelyBones’ mission is to, both literally and metaphorically, take up space.

“When we go to skateparks where there are a lot of men who aren’t used to sharing space. We feel it’s our responsibility to lead and guide people into spaces like that. [We] encourage our power in numbers and try to take up space consciously,” Lee said. “As we start to be more comfortable taking up that space physically, it will translate to taking up space in a more metaphorical sense in skate culture and the skate industry.”

The collective’s meetups are designed for women, transgender individuals, and nonbinary folks. Lee said they won’t assume anyone’s identity, but they ask those the community isn’t designed for to respect their space.

Founders Rayven Tate and Claire Lee in action. Becca Brichacek

Ultimately, Lee, Tate, and Brichacek’s goal is to reform skate culture from the ground up by creating a welcoming community where anyone can feel comfortable learning. They’re working on multiple new projects, including skate events for school-age children and a website.

“In our formative years, it was implied that [skating] was off-limits to us,” Lee said. “We feel those impacts as young adults. Now, as a wave of early 20-year-old people are starting to come into their own, we feed off each other’s courage.”

T-Mobile will air ads on CBS this Super Bowl Sunday. But one advertisement for the big game starring Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski won’t be among them, with the telecommunications company claiming it was “banned.”

“If you retire now, you’ll be walking on soft sand in a week,” Gronkowski says. “Just come to Florida and feel the wind in your hair.”

Over a garbled connection, however, Brady hears: “You retire now, you’re soft and weak. Just come to Florida and win another one.”

T-Mobile claims the commercial was “banned” from airing during the big game because of a “protected telco rights deal.”

“We made this amazing ad starring the amazing Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski,” a T-Mobile spokesperson said via a press release. “Even after editing, the spot was still banned ‘based on the … protected telco rights deal.’ So, watch and decide for yourself … what might the ‘official telco sponsor’ not want you to see?”

T-Mobile does not name the company it’s referring to in the press release. In 2019, Verizon inked a two-year deal to become the “Official 5G Innovation Partner of the NFL.”

When asked for more details about why the commercial was rejected, a spokesperson for T-Mobile told Boston.com that “all we know is — even after editing — we got an email saying it was banned, referring to the ‘protected telco rights deal.’”

It’s an NFL-sponsored treat for eight Massachusetts General medical professionals who will enjoy the Buccaneers-Chiefs game this Sunday from Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium. The locals will be joined by 7,500 front line workers from across the country.

After helping Boston weather the pandemic, a small group of healthcare workers stumbled upon the prize of a lifetime: a ride on the New England Patriots’ plane, a complimentary hotel stay, and tickets to see Tom Brady (possibly) win another Super Bowl.

The invitation is a way to thank the doctors, nurses, and clinicians grappling with COVID-19 every day, as cases and deaths mount. Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft called Diop and her colleagues “superheroes” in a statement.

“I believe that many of the people in our healthcare industries are underappreciated,” he said. “They risk their well-being to ensure ours. It is what they do every day. We are honored to recognize and reward them with this trip to Tampa for Super Bowl LV. It is nice to care for those who provide such compassionate care for us.”

The trip will likely be an adventure for the workers, many of whom have largely split their time between home and the hospital for the last eleven months. On Sunday morning, they will board the New England Patriots’ private plane. Then they’re invited to attend a pre-game concert, followed by biggest American sports event of the year. That night’s hotel stay will be on the Patriot’s dime, just like the lavish jet flight back to Boston.

A select few attendees may “take part in various Super Bowl LV festivities,” according to a press release, but the details are a mystery.

The Massachusetts General participants were chosen through a random, hospital-wide raffle. Each of them is fully vaccinated and will follow mask mandates, social distancing guidelines, and other safety restrictions on the trip.

One lucky recipient, Jairah Zinni, is most excited to see Brady in the flesh — even if it is in a Bucs jersey.

A resident nurse, Zinni grew up watching the Patriots “in the Dark Ages” as a Norton native. She saw Brady grow up on screen, winning Super Bowl after Super Bowl. (In case you’ve lost count, he has six wins, all with the Pats, to date.)

Nurse Jairah Zinni will root for Brady and the Bucs when she attends the Super Bowl in person this Sunday. Jairah Zinni

“I have to root for Brady. I have a huge amount of respect for him,” Zinni said in a phone interview. “He’s a great role model for the younger generation in terms of perseverance and commitment.”

Day to day, Zinni works with coronavirus patients in the emergency wards. But this weekend should be a well-deserved change of pace.

She said discovering she had won the ticket, at home last Wednesday, was surreal.

“My manager told me to check my email, and I read it, but I didn’t absorb that I was the one winning one of the tickets for a few seconds,” Zinni said. “I just went crazy after.”

For Diop, news of the prize could not have come at a better time. She had just finished up a difficult day at work with the long-term stresses of the pandemic weighing down on her. The tickets lifted her spirits instantly, prompting Diop to run around her apartment and abandon her work for the night.

She also phoned her football-loving brother who would always turn on the game in their childhood.

“I never thought I’d be saying — especially in the world we live in right now — that I’d be going to the Super Bowl,” she said via phone.

The women will be accompanied by six other hospital workers neither of them knows particularly well. There’s material manager Lisa Martino; nurse Catherine Chittick; respiratory therapist Jacqueline Garvey; Joshua Baugh from the emergency department; and Godfrey Adamu and Tyrone Walker-White from clinical support.

“It’ll be nice to have a good time with these people and see them at ease and relaxed,” Zinni said. “We’ll finally be in a different environment.”

Diop hopes to “make some friends.”

Despite this dose of good news, the two miss their pre-pandemic lives and acknowledge the pressure the health crisis and increased workload have brought.

Diop misses bonding with her co-residents and faculty in traditional ways, like she did in her first few months of residency. And it pains her to see patients struggle — or die — without family members by their bedside.

“The days are long and hard but definitely rewarding,” she said. “I went into medicine to help people heal, to help reduce suffering. And while I did not think I’d be working in a pandemic, it’s our job to be there for those in need.”

Zinni struggles with the unpredictability of the virus but maintains her faith in God and unexpected silver linings.

In the end, the game should be a distraction from the ongoing pandemic — and a refuge from a world impounded by grief and sorrow.

“Somehow, someone was looking out for me, and the stars aligned to make this happen,” Diop said. “So I’m going to enjoy it.”

Strangers approaching Levy on the street and shouting the signature line of Alexis Rose — the sister to his character, David, in the popular television series — at him: “Ew!”

“Some good: People finally started watching our show ‘Schitt’s Creek.’ And we were fortunate enough to win nine Emmys this year,” he began. “Unbelievable. Beyond a dream come true.”

Dan Levy has had quite a year. And in his opening monologue for “Saturday Night Live” — his first time hosting the sketch comedy show — he addressed the “good” and “bad” that the past 12 months have brought him.

“But in all seriousness, for all the good and the not so good, I have somehow found myself here on this iconic stage standing in front of all of you,” Levy said. “And trust me when I say this, it has only been good here at SNL.”

Levy then brought the audience on a backstage tour to give a humorous preview of how the show is running amid a global pandemic, which involved frequent interruptions from a safety officer named Doreen (Aidy Bryant).

Between being poked by Doreen with a six-foot noodle to emphasize social distancing and having his hand swatted down when pointing to allegedly prevent droplets from spreading, Levy showed members of the cast being sprayed with antiviral mist, the blocked-off and glowing dressing room of indie-rock star Phoebe Bridgers, and even one familiar face: his own father, Eugene Levy.

Eugene Levy had flown in to wish him “luck” but because he traveled, ended up in a glass “isolation box.”

“Well, I’d offer to help, but we’re live on TV,” Dan Levy said.

Sketches throughout the show touched on the coronavirus pandemic and the upcoming Super Bowl, among other topics.

In “Super Bowl Pod,” Levy is gathered with a group of friends to watch the game despite the ongoing health crisis and warning from officials to avoid attending parties. They repeatedly assure each other that they have done “everything right” and “deserve this” — then proceed to list out activities they have kept up with like wrestling, traveling, and hanging out with friends.

“It’s so selfish. It’s so disgusting,” the group said, after admonishing those who are still engaging in social activities (like themselves.) The sketch seemed to highlight the ongoing “pandemic shaming” of individuals, but also the risks that come with ignoring public health advice.

After none of the friends can smell or taste the chili prepared by the host (played by Beck Bennett), Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, makes an appearance.

“Right now, you’re probably feeling like most Americans. Bored, horny, and borderline nuts. I know I am,” McKinnon said. “But what you just saw is the wrong way to Super Bowl.”

Meanwhile, in “Zillow,” the sketch plays up the boredom of many during the pandemic — but is mainly targeted toward those in their late 30s — by highlighting the appeal of Zillow to stave off boredom.

“You’re in your late 30s. Time for a new fantasy — on Zillow,” several cast members say during the faux commercial.

The clip features a number of adults browsing the expensive homes of others and appearing to be satisfied doing so.

“I’d never live in North Carolina, but if I did, I could buy a big, gross mansion,” Levy croons.

And the American indie-rock musician Phoebe Bridgers brought the power in her electric debut on “Saturday Night Live,” performing “Kyoto” and “I Know The End” off of her highly-acclaimed album “Punisher.”

The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter donned her classic skeleton suit during “Kyoto” and at the end of her performance of “I Know The End” — which featured her belting out screams — smashed her electric guitar, sending sparks flying as trumpets blared in the background.

“Hello and welcome to the Super Bowl, four hours of television for 11 minutes of action,” said Kenan Thompson, introducing himself as sports broadcaster “James, no not that one, Brown.”

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off against the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday, in what will mark quarterback Tom Brady’s 10th Super Bowl. As a preview for what’s to come, “Saturday Night Live” opened the show with a mock sports broadcast that ridiculed the efforts of advertisers to present themselves as socially conscious and tackled current issues dividing the nation.

“As everyone at home knows, this year has been anything but normal,” Thompson said. “The pandemic, racial and political divisions, Armie Hammer. But today we come together in a spirit of unity to watch football and murder millions of chickens for their delicious wings.”

The parody of “NFL Today” poked fun at the NFL’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and also to be more inclusive — following a rocky past in how the league handled protests calling for racial justice and an end to police brutality — this season.

“The league also dealt with so many COVID restrictions this year. But with hard work and vigilance, we were able to get through the season with only 700 cases,” Thompson said. “Hooray us.”

The show also didn’t hesitate to joke about the difference in age between Buccs quarterback Brady, who is 43 years old, and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is 25 years old.

“The game is also being simulcast on the Bravo network, where it’s hosted by Andy Cohen,” Day said. “And instead of the Super Bowl, it’s called ‘Old Hag vs. Young Slut.’”

The crew then presented a number of mock commercials that would air during the Big Game, playing up the efforts of advertisers to seize on “the importance of this moment in history” with “impassioned commercials” — a ploy, the show seemed to suggest, aimed at generating a large profit.

One such commercial was for Papa John’s, which has been embroiled in scandal itself, that appeared to be an ad for QAnon, the viral pro-Trump conspiracy theory, while another from Budweiser touched on the pandemic and encouraged viewers to get their “second dose” — “of cold refreshing Bud Light,” that is.

But the highlight of the sketch was the appearance of Aidy Bryant, who played both Chiefs coach Andy Reid and Buccs coach Bruce Arians.

“Speaking of both sides, let’s talk to both of these incredible coaches about how they’re preparing for the big game,” Thompson said.

Bryant made a quick costume change as she alternated between the two coaches — including the addition of a pair of glasses for Arians — and revealed the strategy for how each would be approaching the game (which turned out to be quite similar).

“Well, we’re gonna run it first, then pass it, and then when they have the ball, we’re gonna try to take the ball back,” Bryant said.

Abigail Kohler is co-founder and chief executive of ResusciTech , a Providence-based startup that recently developed an app that brings first aid and CPR training and certification to iOS and Android platforms, without additional equipment needed.

The Boston Globe’s weekly Ocean State Innovators column features a Q&A with Rhode Island innovators who are starting new businesses and nonprofits, conducting groundbreaking research, and reshaping the state’s economy. Send tips and suggestions to reporter Edward Fitzpatrick at edward.fitzpatrick@globe.com and to Alexa Gagosz at alexa.gagosz@globe.com

Kohler: My cofounder, Greg Fine, and I started ResusciTech in October of 2018 when we were both juniors at Brown. At the time, I was taking a medical illustration class that gave me the opportunity to do observations in hospitals. While observing, I overheard an EMT talking about how difficult it is to do CPR because it’s challenging to gauge compression depth.

We then relied on our engineering backgrounds and began to develop a solution: software that can measure chest compression depth and rate all from a smartphone. Our continued research brought us to a CPR training class, where we realized we could use our technology to make significant improvements and bring CPR training into the 21st century.

Advertisement

Q: Why should people turn to your new app instead of getting CPR certified in more-traditional ways?

Kohler: Our app is far more convenient and accessible than traditional classes, without sacrificing quality. We combine the best that e-learning has to offer with the hands-on component of CPR feedback so that you have an engaging and fruitful learning experience. We leverage smartphones to bring interactive CPR training straight to you, without added costs, equipment, wasted time, or dull lectures like traditional classes. Our technology modernizes CPR training and enables completely remote CPR certification.

Advertisement

Q: Tell us about how the Smart Certification app works.

Kohler: After downloading the app, users can create an account and start learning for free. Users then complete interactive education sessions and learn basic first aid, AED use, and CPR. Then, they can practice their chest compressions with real time feedback.

To do this, users hold their phones while performing chest compressions on a household object like a couch cushion. We use the sensors that are already in your phone to measure and analyze the compressions you perform. In real time, the phone provides audio feedback and visual feedback to guide you and correct your compressions, proving your capability and giving you confidence.

After this, users can decide whether or not to purchase a certificate, and then they are done! We give users the opportunity to learn completely free of charge on our platform.

Q: You were recently named a finalist in the American Heart Association’s Empowered to Serve 2020 Business Accelerator, where you received a $40,000 grant for your work to train more people in hands-on CPR. What will that grant go toward?

Kohler: One of the first things we are going to do is get our app translated in multiple languages. Currently, it is only in English, but by having it translated we will be able to improve accessibility and bring life-saving training to more communities.

Beyond that, we are going to use it to improve awareness and create communities prepared for cardiac emergencies. We are planning to start some exciting initiatives to get users more involved and eager to become advocates for CPR knowledge in their own communities.

Q: What are some of the biggest challenges that ResusciTech faces right now, and how will you address them?

Kohler: Right now we are gearing up for our public launch of the app this month. We have been beta testing, iterating, and improving past versions for months and I’m excited to launch it to the public. That being said, the shift from distribution of the app being controlled to being widely available on the app store is a daunting one. Our biggest challenge right now is trying to make sure we see and mitigate every potential pitfall before it happens and ensure that our launch goes smoothly.

Q: What are some goals that you and your team have for the next year? What about for the next five years?

Kohler: In the next year we are planning to develop several partnerships with businesses and even with local nonprofits who have a strong alignment with our mission. We are also planning to begin the necessary research and tests required to apply for FDA clearance so that our CPR feedback software is suitable for use on people during real emergencies. We also plan to expand our team and bring on people to conduct sales and manage our partnerships.

In the next five years our largest goal is to obtain FDA clearance on our CPR feedback software for use during real emergencies. Additionally, we plan to expand our training offerings to provide remote solutions for other types of medical training.

That’s nearly as many as all of the voters — Democrats, Republicans, and Moderates — who changed parties or disaffiliated in January 2017, after the last presidential election.

PROVIDENCE — After the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists and supporters of former President Donald J. Trump, about 1,500 Republicans in Rhode Island left their party.

In January, 1,423 Republicans disaffiliated altogether, with all but 94 leaving on or after the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to data requested by the Globe from the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office. There were 118 Republicans who disaffiliated the day after the riot at the Capitol -- and 88 Republicans who became unaffiliated on Inauguration Day.

Another 92 Republicans became Democrats, and all but seven of those voters made the switch on or after Jan. 6.

More unaffiliated voters also registered as Democrats than Republicans, 508 to 290, in January.

While there were slightly more Democrats who either disaffiliated or switched parties, the Republican Party in Rhode Island is about one-third the size of the Democratic Party, and so losses of Republican voters have a greater impact in the state.

There are 717,510 active registered voters in Rhode Island, including 102,288 Republicans and 311,413 Democrats. There are also 303,809 active voters who are not affiliated with either party.

Last month, 1,820 Democrats left the party, including 1,688 who disaffiliated and 132 Democrats who became Republicans. Of those, 105 registered Democrats joined the GOP on or after Jan. 6. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats didn’t see a large jump in voters leaving the party on the day of the insurrection, or afterward, or on Inauguration Day.

Overall, last month there were more than double the number of Rhode Islanders who changed parties or disaffiliated, compared with January 2017.

One possible reason: Voters can change their party affiliation, though not cancel their registration, during interactions at the Division of Motor Vehicles.

Rhode Island implemented automated voter registration in 2018, which means the Secretary of State’s office now receives voter record updates daily from the DMV, said Nick Domings, spokesman for Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea.

The dates reflect when the local boards of canvassers enter the voter cancellations or party changes into the Central Voter Registration System. While both parties had a large bump in voter disaffiliations on Jan. 14, that jump was attributed to problems the DMV had from Jan. 7 to Jan. 13 that prevented data transfers, Domings said in an email.

A surge in fraud quickly followed.,[''],en,2/5/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"Since April 2020, authorities have received more than 44,000 complaints of unemployment insurance fraud, Creamer said. In some of those cases, the fraudulent claims were detected before the payments were made, he said.

The complaints started in March 2020 after the pandemic hit and leveled off at about 100 complaints per day, State Police Captain Robert A. Creamer said. “But we are seeing a very significant increase in complaints in the last three or four weeks,” he said.

PROVIDENCE — Rhode Island is receiving 800 to 1,000 complaints per day about unemployment insurance fraud now that the federal government has extended a COVID-19 relief package and boosted weekly unemployment checks by $300, officials said Friday.

But Margaux Fontaine, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Training, said the state has confirmed $23 million in unemployment insurance fraud since the pandemic began. She said she could not detail how many state residents have been victims of that fraud, but she said the number of cases has been rising since the start of 2021.

“The extra $300 added to the unemployment insurance makes it more compelling for fraudsters,” Fontaine said. “It’s a national issue. It’s definitely a big problem.”

The claims stem from “imposter fraud,” Fontaine said.

“How it works is that at some point someone had their personal information stolen, and the fraudsters will use that information to file an unemployment insurance claim,” she explained. People who are still employed then receive notifications from the Department of Labor and Training about how to apply for unemployment insurance benefits, she said.

“If people receive a letter in the mail and they didn’t file for unemployment benefits, we would strongly encourage them to report it to the State Police,” Fontaine said. “There is a page on the Department of Labor and Training website that has the steps you should take if you believe you are a victim of unemployment insurance fraud.”

Those who file a report with the State Police Financial Crimes Unit are informed that there is “an ongoing, large-scale federal and state investigation of unemployment insurance benefit fraud that began in April 2020.”

The State Police website says authorities believe most victims in this investigation had their personally identifiable information stolen in a cyber data breach. These types of breaches have been occurring regularly over the past 10 years, it says.

The State Police recommend that victims also report the identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission at www.identitytheft.gov and visit www.annualcreditreport.com, which allows one free credit report inquiry with one of the three larger credit reporting agencies.

Additionally, victims should change all of their passwords to online accounts, the State Police said. “The stronger and longer your passwords, the more difficult it is for a hacker to compromise them,” they said.

Creamer said the investigation of the fraud has been turned over to the FBI because the suspected perpetrators appear to be from outside Rhode Island and, in some cases, outside the United States.

Fontaine said the majority of the $23 million in fraudulent payments involve federal funding. Not all the money will be lost, she said. “We are working with banks to claw back some of the payments, and we are working with insurance companies to try to get some of it back.”

I’m here to work with everyone, and see us through this.”

For Fuller, who describes herself as “body and soul committed” to helping Newton through this time, those challenges are all the more reason to ask voters for a second term.

Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller will seek reelection this year facing a set of challenges unimaginable four years ago: a pandemic, an economic crisis, and calls to end systemic racism in law enforcement and society.

Newton resident Al Cecchinelli, who previously ran for mayor in 2017, is contemplating a run this year, he told the Globe in an e-mail. He is the only prospective challenger so far to publicly show interest in the mayoral race. He is concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on signature gathering and campaigning, he said.

The city’s mayoral election is scheduled for Nov. 2. Nomination papers will be available May 1, according to City Clerk David Olson.

Fuller still carries the responsibilities that came with the job she was elected to in 2017, but her role has grown in response to the coronavirus crisis.

She has been involved with building new programs to buoy businesses and residents who have suffered economically, and with efforts to reorganize schools to operate safely. As the state ramps up the administration of vaccines, Fuller has pledged to keep residents informed, while the city’s health department expects to launch a website focused on vaccine distribution information.

She also has launched a sweeping effort to eliminate systemic racism in city government, including the police force.

The Rev. Devlin Scott, pastor of NewCity Church, said political leaders like Fuller are facing an unprecedented challenge posed by the combination of the pandemic, societal change, and economic issues.

“Any leader facing all of those things is facing a level of difficulty unlike any other leaders we’ve seen, at least in my lifetime,” said Scott. “She has handled this extremely well.”

This month, Fuller also had to respond to the fatal police shooting of a 28-year-old resident who officials have said was experiencing a mental health crisis.

Fuller, a former Ward 7 councilor-at-large, made history when she became the first woman to serve as Newton’s chief executive after she was elected the city’s 31st mayor in 2017.

As mayor, Fuller said her accomplishments include implementing full-day kindergarten and opening the new Cabot Elementary School; finding a path forward on an updated Senior Center; delivering the city’s climate action plan; and the eminent domain taking of Webster Woods from Boston College. The city’s finances, she said, have been built strong enough to weather the pandemic’s economic impact.

As the year’s crises unfolded, elected officials had to pivot to respond. No mayor had a playbook for navigating so many emergencies at once, she said. But Fuller was not working alone.

“I largely feel deep gratitude for the people here in Newton who every day are digging deep and finding a way to ... help each other through this,” Fuller said.

Susan Albright, the City Council president, praised Fuller’s leadership throughout her term. On longstanding issues facing the city, such as housing and roadway improvements, the mayor has continued to make progress, Albright said.

“She absolutely has a handle on what the problems are in the city” and how to address them, Albright said. “She is pointing the city in the right direction.”

Greg Reibman, president of the Newton-Needham Regional Chamber, praised Fuller’s management of the city. But while she has tried to be helpful to business, Reibman said the chamber has sometimes been disappointed that Newton has moved more slowly than other communities with relief initiatives for restaurants and small retailers.

“She is generally pretty conservative, and is not one of those municipal leaders who chooses to be up front on new initiatives,” Reibman said.

Liz Mirabile, chairwoman of the Newton Lower Falls Improvement Association’s Riverside Committee, said that during discussions over Mark Development’s mixed-use development at the Riverside MBTA station, Fuller did not support neighbors who raised concerns over traffic and the size of buildings.

“She listened to us, but she did not advocate for us, or work with us in any way to lessen the impact” of the project, Mirabile said.

Instead, Ward 4 city councilors advocated on their behalf, and the developer also proactively worked with neighbors and provided updated information on the project, Mirabile said.

Fuller, who has excellent “people skills,” could make a difference going forward by being an advocate for those impacted by development, Mirabile said.

Doris Ann Sweet, a member of Engine 6, which advocates for affordable housing in Newton, praised the mayor’s outreach efforts during visioning efforts along major corridors, like Washington and Needham streets. Fuller also has worked to create new affordable housing and joined a coalition of mayors to help address the issue.

Fuller, when speaking with residents one-on-one, is focused on listening to their opinions, Sweet said. During demonstrations in Newton against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police last May, Sweet said she saw Fuller out on the streets, talking to people and hearing what they had to say.

“She’s genuine, and she’s listening,” Sweet said. “She’s responding, I think, from the heart.”

Some wish there was more outreach. In Newton, planning for the reopening of schools was hampered by an increasingly bitter debate. Many teachers were concerned for their safety, while parents were divided on how best to bring students back into classrooms.

Michael Zilles, president of the Newton Teachers Association, said progress on addressing teachers’ concerns — particularly ventilation improvements and COVID-19 surveillance testing — has been slow.

“I wish someone had tried to take a leadership role on this, yes, and I think that role would have naturally fallen to her,” Zilles said. “It would be great if she reached out to me and said, ‘Mike, I hear that you still have concerns. What can we do together to alleviate those?’”

Fuller said she is working to allow in-person education to move forward. She pointed to efforts including investing in ventilation systems, as well as surveillance testing for educators and staff, which began in December.

“I will continue to do everything I can, working with our educators, our parents, and our community, to support our education system in this difficult period,” Fuller said.

Scott, with NewCity Church, said Fuller is not afraid of facing difficult issues head-on.

During the summer, Scott hosted a Hope is Rising concert that included a panel discussion with Fuller, Black community leaders, and a representative from the Newton Police Department to discuss racial equity and other issues.

Fuller declared systemic racism is real, Scott recalled, and that she would work to eliminate it as mayor.

“She listened to the people around her and the people in the community, whose voices matter,” Scott said. “That is political courage, especially in this day and age.”

It also followed an alert from the Baker administration to local health officials across the state warning that COVID-19 vaccine supplies may be limited next month due to a shortage of allocations from the federal government.

Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller said Tuesday that the city’s Health and Human Services staff will focus in February on vaccinating people in high-risk congregate housing, and the city is developing a webpage to provide residents with easy access to the latest vaccine distribution information.

Newton officials were told Sunday that the state is not allocating local health departments vaccines for large public health clinics, Fuller said, and Newton’s health department has been capped at 100 doses per week through February.

The state is focusing Phase 2 vaccination distribution at high-volume, large venue sites like Gillette Stadium, she said.

At the beginning of Phase 2, residents age 75 and older are eligible to receive the vaccine. Governor Charlie Baker announced Monday that people who are age 65 and older and those with two chronic health conditions have been prioritized to receive the vaccine next — though it means delaying providing doses to some workers, including teachers and grocery store employees.

“The information and plans for vaccination sites has a lot of people in Newton feeling frustrated and more than ready for their turn in line after months of suffering through this pandemic,” Fuller said. “I am almost in daily communication with partners across the Commonwealth and decision makers on Beacon Hill, sharing our concerns and working to encourage better systems to serve our residents and employees.”

Since the start of the pandemic, there have been more than 3,000 cases of COVID-19 in Newton, and nearly 200 deaths, according to the city.

Fuller said the city is setting up a vaccine webpage in the coming days to provide information for residents about vaccine distribution.

Newton Senior Services staff and volunteers are conducting outreach for those who need help with the online sign-up process. Those who need assistance are asked to call the Newton Senior Center at (617) 796-1660.

Newton’s public health staff is also holding online virtual meetings with older residents in Newton on Wednesday, Feb. 3, from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., Fuller said. Pre-registration is required, and residents can sign up online.

“Our staff will be answering questions about the COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to get clear, accurate information out about the vaccine and distribution,” Fuller said.

Paula Gannon, the director of Newton Cultural Development, said art plays a part in helping residents cope with the pandemic.

In an effort to connect its residents, support local businesses, and help the artistic community recover from the pandemic’s financial impact, Newton Cultural Development is working with local nonprofits, organizations and individuals to fund and organize art projects in the city, including artist-painted doors and live-streamed concerts.

Gloria Gavris, chair of directors of Newton Community Pride, a nonprofit that helps fund and organize art, cultural, and community events in the city, said the pandemic has had a severe impact on local arts and culture. While some businesses and organizations managed to adapt, she said, others struggled.

“Some were much more adept at learning and educating themselves in terms of taking their audience and their organization to pivot to an online format, and others not so much,” Gavris said. “That’s why you see some nonprofits struggling in the community as well as small businesses and others thriving because they have been able to pivot successfully.”

As the pandemic hit Newton last year, many of its art and culture offices and organizations had to temporarily shut down and reinvent themselves, turning to outdoors and online events instead.

At Newton Theatre Company, student registrations have gone down by about 75 percent in the pandemic, said Melissa Bernstein, the company’s artistic director. Most of the students left will graduate from the program soon, so Bernstein said she anticipates more challenges in the future.

“It will be like almost starting from scratch again in the Fall if we can get a place to be in person with the kids, so I think that will be our biggest struggle and the biggest effect for us,” Bernstein said.

Despite the impacts of the pandemic, Bernstein said the company continued with live online plays, which have grown a national audience, allowing them to keep a lot of their actors.

Due to the pandemic, arts and culture nonprofits around the country have lost an estimated $15.03 billion as of Jan. 25, according to data from Americans for the Arts. At the individual level, 63 percent of artists have become unemployed, and 95 percent have reported a loss in income.

Newton’s Cultural Council received a record of 69 grant applications for the creation of art in the city this year in comparison to 55 from last year, said Christopher Pitts, the council’s co-chair.

Pitts said it is important to fund local artists because they don’t have as much access to governmental support.

“The problem with artists is that many of them are not on any kind of payroll,” he said.

For 2021, Newton Cultural Development plans to pair up with local nonprofits, organizations and individuals to revive arts and culture around the city. Gavris and Gannon said upcoming projects this year include window art in the village center’s vacant storefronts, a parlor performance series, connecting private landowners with mural artists and painting jersey barriers, picnic tables and bringing plants to outdoor dining areas.

In partnership with Newton Community Pride, the city also is hosting a Newton “Out Doors” competition, in which local artists are submitting door painting designs that will be judged and selected to become part of a temporary, outdoor installation around the city that will consist of 20 recycled, painted wooden doors.

Hooked on Newton, a yarn bombing project, is planning a return this Spring. Participants will meet in weekly Zoom sessions to create “fiber art pieces” and then install those urban sweaters around the city while following governmental health social gathering guidelines.

Gavris said projects in 2021 are meant to support and reach the local community.

“Because performance space is no longer available or social gatherings are no longer available, we wanted to bring art to where people are in the Village Centers,” Gavris said. “We want to be supportive — financially supportive and artistically supportive — this year as the city comes alive again in the Spring.”

There was no clear agenda for the session, called by the city manager. It was just a get-to-know-you session for people who take on the city’s myriad challenges - from housing to hunger to mental health - often fighting from their own little silos.

The On the Street series looks at the past, present, and future of neighborhoods in Greater Boston.

To some, it felt like a distraction from the work. Cara Cogliano, a social worker who runs Chelsea Community Connections, an agency that works to prevent child abuse, chafed a bit, wondering why they were there.

“It felt like it had no purpose,” she recalled. “But we’d never actually sat in a room together and talked.”

But a couple of months later, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged through the largely immigrant and working-class city, many of those same people were talking daily, trying to figure out how Chelsea would get through it.

The call to action started with a phone call.

On March 11, Mimi Graney, the city’s civic design and engagement strategist, and Roseann Bongiovanni, a former city councilor who now leads the environmental justice nonprofit GreenRoots, sent a shared conference line to several people who had attended that January meeting. Soon, others joined the call. (“It was a glorified party line,” Graney said.)

For the next 78 days, dozens of leaders and volunteers from throughout the city would join a 4 p.m. call to triage Chelsea’s most pressing needs.

“At that point in the pandemic, what was true in the morning was no longer true by the end of the day,” Graney said. “We went with the assumption that there is no cavalry.”

So they did what they could on their own.

For Cogliano, whose agency has long run a free clothing closet out of its storefront office, that meant negotiating with BJ’s Wholesale Club to buy pallets of diapers to give away each week. For staff at GreenRoots, it meant diving into complex state housing programs to help renters stay in their homes. And for La Colaborativa, it meant launching a food pantry that began on the executive director’s front porch and now fills an old warehouse near City Hall where more than 1,500 boxes of food are packed and delivered daily.

That operation does more than just feed people, said chief operating officer Dinanyili Paulino. La Colaborativa staffs it with onsite immigration lawyers and housing counselors, uses it as a command center for community organizing, and this week was gathering donations - from struggling Chelsea residents - that will be sent to Honduras to help it recover from Hurricane Iota.

Like other groups on the front lines in Chelsea, Paulino said, La Colaborativa is trying to sustain a community amidst a pandemic that’s pushing people apart in so many ways.

“People come here and they connect with one another,” she said. “We see people. We maintain communications. There’s a safety net here.”

Now, as a second wave of the pandemic rises, many people in Chelsea are starting to think about how this network can build more than just a safety net, how it might steer the city through the recovery that will someday come, and ensure that any rebound benefits those who most need support.

From rising rents to pollution to immigration crackdowns, Chelsea faced its share of challenges before the pandemic. Those haven’t gone away, said GreenRoots executive director Roseann Bongiovanni. If anything, COVID-19 has made them worse. But it has also given everyone a road map for how they might work together to tackle the city’s problems.

“We’ve really broken down the silos,” Bongiovanni said. “I think post-pandemic you’re going to see a lot of collaboration, and this might give us an opportunity to think about the larger structural issues. Like why are so many people in Chelsea food insecure? Why is it that Chelsea was so sick?”

To Cogliano, the crisis has highlighted just how fragile people’s work and home structures can be. Chelsea has a large population of newer immigrants, some of whom are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to an economic downturn. Many lack bank accounts and credit cards. When restaurants and hotels and even warehouses closed this spring, a whole informal economy that sustained the community evaporated.

“All those jobs washed up,” she said. There was no money to pay a baby sitter, or to sublet a room. “And [now people] don’t have access to cash. This is a hugely cash-based community.”

That filters out to the small businesses that line Broadway, the shopping district at the heart of Chelsea where you can buy $1 pupusas or a prepaid cellphone or a whole bedroom set. Those shops serve the residents of nearby blocks, who often don’t have the cars or the credit cards needed to shop elsewhere.

“The community has always been very supportive of itself,” said Carlos Matos, chief executive of the Chelsea Business Foundation, a nonprofit launched by the city’s Chamber of Commerce. “In part because it’s been isolated from the mainstream.”

Signs about wearing masks and protecting neighbors are everywhere in Chelsea, such as at this storefront on Broadway. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

That isolation took a toll during the initial onslaught of the pandemic, Matos said. Business at many stores fell by half. But because their owners didn’t trust government loan programs run by agencies they weren’t familiar with, they didn’t seek help until Matos encouraged them to apply for assistance.

“For a company to feel trust and value it has to be on public display, and there is not a statue, not a street, not a public homage to the 70 percent of the population in this city that is Latino,” Matos said. “No one at City Hall or any high-level position speaks Spanish. All those things don’t engender trust.”

Over the last few months, Matos has tried to build bonds, working with the city to create a need-based metric for business aid. So far, he’s signed up 150 companies for Chelsea’s new $1 million grant program, which will provide small-business assistance for the next three months.

Sustaining businesses, large and small, is essential to Chelsea’s future, said City Councilor Damali Vidot. If the city is going to rebuild into something sustainable, people need good jobs that can support their families.

Getting to that point will take outside help, Vidot said. Chelsea’s needs exceed what any small, poor, city can meet on its own, she said, so she’s looking to Beacon Hill or Washington. Eighty percent of Chelsea’s workforce is employed in essential industries, many in neighboring Boston, from restaurants to hotels to warehouses. They just want the chance to be self-sufficient, Vidot said.

“We’re an immigrant community, people who came to this country to do better for themselves,” she said. “They didn’t come here to stand two hours in line for a box of food. No one wants to live like that.”

Some outside groups have already stepped up.

Last month, the Shah Family Foundation - the nonprofit started by Wayfair cofounder Niraj Shah and his wife, Jill Shah- announced plans to offset some of the pressure on food banks by seeding Chelsea Eats, a $3 million program that supplies preloaded debit cards for purchasing groceries.

Many are calling it an experiment in universal basic income. But only 2,000 of the 3,500 applicants gained access to the program, so organizations such as the nonprofit Project Bread have been encouraging the other 1,500 to overcome the fear that many undocumented immigrants have of of signing up for federally funded programs like the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP.

“People just stayed away from the program, they stayed away from any government program,” said Erin McAleer, executive director of Project Bread. But it “relieves their budget so they have money to pay their rent.”

Ultimately, Chelsea will take the lead in tackling its challenges, whether that’s social service agencies assuming new duties in a crisis or neighbors simply helping each other out. That’s what Sara Arman is doing.

The 23-year-old Chelsea native, who’s pursuing a master’s degree in urban planning at Harvard University, is working on health issues at GreenRoots as part of a neighborhood wellness group, coordinating grocery deliveries, filling out applications for aid programs, even setting up Wi-Fi. In a city where many people are stressed, where worries about immigration status mean “people might not always feel comfortable talking to their neighbors,” she says, those human connections can go a long way.

“Most people in the community recognize that if we build strong infrastructure now and strong communications and having a sense of community in Chelsea, it will be beneficial to everyone in the long run,” Arman said.

But also, she said, it’s important to find ways to celebrate the city’s strength. After all, COVID-19 is just the latest crisis Chelsea has faced. It will survive this, too, and years from now, people will want to know about how it went from the dark to the light. So Arman is collecting their stories, recollections of what life has been like these last eight months - details that go beyond the raw numbers of infection rates and eviction stats.

She’s hoping the narrative of Chelsea that emerges from the pandemic is not just one of struggle.

“Joy and resilience,” Arman said, will also be part of the story.

As it arrives, many say it must make sure to include those who live in Brockton now.",[''],en,10/14/2020 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"The On the Street series looks at the past, present, and future of neighborhoods in Greater Boston.

Downtown, Marvelous Marvin Hagler stares out from a mural on Main Street, a few blocks from the gym where he learned to fight.

There are even remnants, here and there, of a shoe industry that a century ago powered hundreds of factories. They employed waves of immigrants who came to this city to build a life.

But lately Brockton — in earlier times known as Shoe City and the City of Champions — is making a name for itself in other ways. It’s a rare place that’s relatively near Boston - about 20 miles south - yet still affordable for middle-class home buyers. It’s one of the most diverse communities in Eastern Massachusetts. And it has a downtown where new buildings are going up, and new residents are moving in.

All of it points to a resurgence for this long-struggling city of about 95,000, close enough to Boston that many residents commute north each day, but with a culture and orbit all its own. The comeback has been a long time coming. But as it begins to take place, many people say, care must be taken to make sure current Brockton residents - not just newcomers - are part of the turnaround.

“We’re building all this housing, and it’ll change the landscape. How much is it going to change the culture?” said Kimberly Zouzoua, a Brockton resident and nonprofit executive. “We do want to change somewhat. We want to be more progressive, more upscale establishments. But we can’t push out the people in our community who have given and lived their lives here.”

Advertisement

In some ways, Zouzoua herself is an example of the change washing through Brockton. She moved to the city about 20 years ago from Medford, in part to raise her two sons someplace where, as she put it, ""They wouldn’t be the only people of color at their school.” Now her sons call it home. One has “Brockton” tattooed on his arm.

In recent decades, the city — long populated by Irish and Italian immigrants and their descendants — has become home to many Black families, often drawn by the chance to buy a house for far less than they could in Boston. That trend has accelerated lately; a recent study of mortgage data by MassINC found that the number of Black home buyers in Brockton tripled from 2011 to 2017, and that nearly twice as many Black families bought in Brockton as in Boston, which has seven times the population.

New immigrants have come, too, with growing communities from Haiti and various African nations, as well as from Cape Verde. With about 19,000 first- and second-generation Cape Verdeans, Brockton has by some counts the largest Cape Verdean community in North America.

That diversity shows up in the aisles of Vicente’s, a popular supermarket near downtown that stocks everything from plantains to Portuguese rolls to giant bags of rice stacked against a wall. It shows up in the schools, too, where 44 percent of students speak a language other than English at home.

And it’s shaping Brockton’s image of itself, said Mary Waldron, a former city economic development official who now heads the Old Colony Planning Council.

“We are no longer the Shoe City. A lot of young people who live here don’t know who Rocky Marciano is. There’s a lot to be said for our history, but my hope is that we talk about the future, too,” Waldron said. “We are a gateway for a lot of people.”

People like Scarlee Marseille. The 27-year-old and his family immigrated from Haiti about 20 years ago. While a student at Brockton High School, Marseille said, he got interested in computer hardware, designing better screens for MacBooks and mobile phones. In college he launched a startup and spent his afternoons and evenings at a WeWork in Boston trying to build a company.

In the early days, Marseille made the commute to find connections and a startup vibe that he couldn’t get in Brockton. Lately, though, he’s been finding more collaborators closer to home, among creative people like himself who don’t come from the well-trod innovation pathways of Cambridge and Boston.

“We lacked infrastructure and opportunity. But we created a community first, of likeminded creatives who are trying to tackle tough challenges,” Marseille said. “Now we’ll be able to justify building that infrastructure here.”

To Marseille, that means not just incubators and co-working spaces, but also coffee shops and restaurants — places to mingle. It’s crucial, he said, that those places look and feel like the people who call Brockton home today. Together, they can create critical mass for the city, turning it into more than a satellite for that bigger city to the north where he used to work.

“In five or 10 years,” Marseille said, “I like to think that when people talk about going downtown they mean downtown Brockton, not downtown Boston.”

That’s also what city officials have in mind.

Under a former mayor Bill Carpenter, who died last year, and the current mayor, Robert Sullivan, who was elected in November to replace him, Brockton and its Redevelopment Authority have put a number of city-owned buildings and parking lots downtown into the hands of new developers, offering an array of tax breaks to spur construction.

That strategy has generated about 400 new apartments, said Planning Director Rob May, with 700 more in the works. There’s a parking garage, named for Carpenter, that just opened downtown, and a handsomely redone headquarters for the office supply company W.B. Mason, the city’s most prominent homegrown business. The goal, Sullivan said, is the sort of full-service downtown that will draw people 18 hours a day.

“My hope is the sort of development that brings people here. Some of them will live here. Some will work here,” he said. “After COVID is through, we’re working on more restaurants, more coffee shops.""

The efforts are made easier by an essential asset: the train. Ask developers what stands out in downtown Brockton, andm across the board, they mention the MBTA’s commuter rail. The 35-minutes-or-so ride to South Station is a quicker trip than to many places closer to Boston.

""For me, it’s faster to get to South Station from Brockton than from my house in Jamaica Plain,” said Ted Carman, a longtime Boston developer who’s working on two historic rehabs in Brockton, both of them steps from the train station.

One of his projects, in a twist that reflects Brockton old and new, is the former home of the Petronelli Boxing Gym, where Hagler learned to fight and trained as he climbed the middleweight ranks in the 1970s. But the gym is closed, and the four-story brick building — built in 1890 for the St. Patrick’s Temperance Society — has sat vacant for about a decade on a side street.

Last year, Carman bought it from the city, with plans for apartments aimed at people who want high-end living at rents far lower than in a comparable building in Boston.

“The demand is there,” Carman said. “People will come if you can build the right product.”

That’s been the case at another building nearby, XLVII West Elm. It opened last month and has leased 41 of its 44 apartments, with one-bedrooms starting at $1,600 a month. That price is a something of sweet spot, said developer Geoffrey Anatole, significantly cheaper than similar buildings in Boston but high enough to justify new construction in Brockton, especially with help from city incentives. He said tenants are a mix of priced-out Bostonians and Brockton locals looking for nice apartments.

It’s Anatole’s second building downtown, and he’s eyeing other sites. The more market-rate apartments the neighborhood can fill, he said, the more customers there will be for the kinds of restaurants and amenities that will make it a welcoming, thriving, place.

“There’s already a change in the vibe here,” he said. “People are excited about where downtown is going.”

Any revival, many say, must include Brocktonites of all backgrounds.

This summer, following protests over George Floyd’s death, Shaleah Gilmer launched Black-Owned Brockton, a social media platform that promotes, and tries to connect, the city’s small-business community.

She’s launching a website and planning events, around her day job as a youth career counselor. In a city where people tend to stick to their neighborhoods, she said, it’s easy for good ideas, and good people, to slip through the cracks.

“It’s super-challenging,"" Gilmer said. “Even before COVID, a lot of these businesses were not getting much exposure. But there are so many opportunities.”

Zouzoua has a similar view. She walks the streets of her adopted hometown and sees people from all over the world who also have adopted it. She welcomes the new investment and the newcomers — she was once one herself. But Zouzoua wants to make sure there’s a place in a new Brockton for everyone who’s there now.

“I love Brockton, and I’m glad we chose to settle here,” she said. “I do want Brockton to be more metropolitan. But I don’t want it to lose its Brockton feel.”

The On the Street series looks at the past, present, and future of neighborhoods in Greater Boston.

Around the corner, on Hancock Street, diners munched on tacos and sipped margaritas at a line of tables outside a restaurant that opened this summer, while music trickled down from a rooftop bar next door.

And a few blocks up the street, past the new Hancock-Adams Common and an MBTA Red Line station where apartments and office buildings are planned, tech entrepreneurs called it a week at a startup incubator that opened its doors this month.

After a decade of ups and downs, Quincy Center is finally coming into its own. With a wave of new restaurants, hundreds of higher-end apartments and condos, and several sizable office buildings in the works, this long-sleepy business district is emerging — or perhaps reemerging, for those of a certain generation — as the kind of downtown the South Shore has too long lacked.

“Quincy feels kind of like a suburban town that’s turning urban,” said Sean Kenealy, president of the Quincy real estate firm Key Realty. “It’s exciting to see so much going on here.”

This moment has been years in the making. Mayor Thomas Koch has spent more than a decade pushing to revive Quincy Center. In 2011, the development firm Street-Works signed on to lead $1.6 billion worth of projects there. But three years later, with no real progress, Koch cut ties with Street-Works and started farming out city-owned sites to an array of local developers.

The first of those projects, the 169-unit apartment building West of Chestnut, opened four years ago. Since then, the trickle of growth has become a wave. About 700 apartments and condos have opened in the last three years, Koch said, with about that many more in the works. Their ground floors offer a parade of new restaurants and retail spaces.

“The whole idea, from day one, was to create a new neighborhood in our downtown,” Koch said. “Housing over retail and restaurants isn’t exactly a new idea. But it was certainly new to us.”

On the Street: Quincy Center Share Email to a Friend Embed A collection of restaurants has found a home in Quincy Center. ( Shelby Lum/Globe Staff )

In its mid-century heyday, Quincy Center was more of a retail hub. Hancock Street was lined with so many department and specialty stores that it was dubbed Shopperstown, U.S.A. Those stores are long gone — to a mall or out of business — replaced by retailers that over time proved less of a draw. A handful of big employers — the headquarters of Stop & Shop and Quincy Mutual Insurance among them — stuck around. But generally, the sidewalks were rolled up at 6 p.m.

These days, it’s becoming more of an 18-hour neighborhood. Restaurants have set up shop along Hancock Street — everything from Korean BBQ to Indian food amidst throwback mainstays such as the Presidential Pub. Four apartment buildings have opened in the last three years, filling quickly at rents that — while high by Quincy standards — come at a discount compared with those in central Boston, just a Red Line ride away.

The newest is One Chestnut Place, a $65 million, 15-story tower built by longtime Quincy developer Peter O’Connell. When the 124-unit building opened on Sept. 1, it was already half-leased, said Michael DiMella, managing partner at Charlesgate Realty, which is marketing the building.

“We’re getting a lot of people in their late 20s and 30s, people who’ve been living in Boston and are looking for something slightly more affordable,” he said.

And so far, the COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have dimmed interest. While the Red Line connection to downtown Boston is certainly part of Quincy Center’s appeal, DiMella said — though the commute may be less attractive or tolerable than before the pandemic — many renters see Quincy as more than just a bedroom community for Boston.

“Frankly, these days, where people go to work is less of a thing,” he said. “So here you have transportation, yes, but also this really cool downtown neighborhood, with easy access to the beach, golf courses, lots of stuff.”

But for the neighborhood to keep growing, Koch and others working on Quincy Center’s revival say, it needs one more ingredient: jobs. That means more commercial real estate to support the tax base. And more workers to eat at those restaurants and rent those apartments.

The existing office space — mostly in older buildings on Hancock Street — is largely full. Citywide, office buildings are 95 percent occupied, at rents less than half of downtown Boston’s. Kenealy said he’s hearing from more companies that are mulling a move south, particularly life science firms looking for locations near the Red Line but close to the suburbs.

Tim Cahill, president of the Quincy Chamber of Commerce, said he’s been getting a lot of calls, too.

“People are kicking the tires,” Cahill said. “Rents [in Cambridge’s Kendall Square] are just astronomical. And there are a lot of workers on the South Shore who don’t want to commute all the way up to Bedford or Lexington. I can see that industry starting to spread down here.”

But industry needs room to grow.

Large-scale office development in Quincy Center has come slower than new housing, though it’s starting. On a parking lot off Burgin Parkway, FoxRock Properties, a development company owned by Granite Telecommunications founder Robert Hale, is planning a 200,000-square-foot medical office building for Mass General Brigham and South Shore Health. Longer term, 225,000 square feet is planned at the Red Line’s Quincy Center Station, where the MBTA awarded development rights to a pair of builders in 2017.

And already, some are focusing on nurturing smaller companies to grow here. At the beginning of September, the startup incubator QUBIC Labs opened its doors — in an office building owned by FoxRock — to its first companies.

The opening was delayed nearly six months by the COVID-19 pandemic, said executive chairman Ian Cain, a city councilor and president of a business advisory firm. But it’s hoping to take advantage of the pandemic to build a startup ecosystem in someplace a little less crowded than downtown Boston or Cambridge.

“Our goal is to create 1,000 jobs over the next five years,” Cain said. “We want companies to have humble beginnings in our space, then spread out around Quincy. This is pure economic growth.”

And if — or as — those jobs emerge, they’ll enable Quincy Center to add even more ingredients crucial to a contemporary downtown, from entertainment venues to more traditional retail — even if the department stores of Shopperstown, U.S.A., are a thing of the past. That’s the goal, Koch said - a vibrant downtown that serves as the heart of the city, a hub in its own right.

That’s been a long time coming for Quincy Center, the mayor acknowledged. But walking around on a Friday evening near summer’s end, you can finally see it happening.

“The vibe here now,” he said, “it’s just incredible.”

Amidst it all on this summer afternoon: a blue tent where the city health department offered walk-up coronavirus testing, free to all comers.

This seaside city has been having a moment, with apartment buildings sprouting along its famous beach - just a 14-minute ride from downtown Boston and renting at a fraction of the price.

Revere’s revival was well underway until COVID-19, which has hit it as hard as almost anyplace else in the state, wreaking health and economic havoc in a city that’s home to many immigrants and service industry workers. When and how it emerges from the crisis will provide a measure of the “new” Revere’s resiliency, and how well it can serve everyone from longtime lower-income residents to the more-affluent newcomers.

“At this point, it’s really important for us to keep our foot on the gas,” said Mayor Brian Arrigo. “A lot of the oxygen has been sucked out because of COVID, but we need to keep firing on all cylinders.”

That’s not easy to do this summer.

Even as development surges, Revere has been clobbered by COVID-19. Only two cities in Massachusetts, neighboring Chelsea and Lynn, currently have higher infection rates, according to state data. And at 27.6 percent, Revere’s unemployment rate in June was second in the state only to Lawrence’s, reflecting job losses among the huge numbers of residents who work in hotels, restaurants, and other hard-hit service industries.

Helping those people will be essential to any recovery and broader growth for the city, said Wendy Millar-Page, executive director of the Revere Chamber of Commerce.

For years, Revere residents have had a sense the city was on the cusp of change. Suffolk Downs, on the Boston line, was long a front-runner for the casino that ultimately went to Everett. Then it was pitched as a site for Amazon’s so-called HQ2. Neither mega-project came to pass, but “we were winners in losing,” said Robert O’Brien, the city’s director of strategic planning and economic development. Those bids helped Revere catch the eye of builders, and suddenly, he said, the city “was no longer hidden in Boston’s shadow; it had its own spotlight.”

Today, many see revitalization being realized in the strip of glimmering new apartment buildings that dot the waterfront, and in an Amazon warehouse that opened in July in the former Necco factory.

But to some, these changes are not entirely new. They say Revere’s promising future is simply an echo of its past.

Celebrated as the first public beach in America, Revere Beach, with its noisy arcades, amusement rides, and famous fried food, served as a cheap and easy escape from downtown Boston for over a century. But gradually, the good times faded. The roller coaster came down, and the dance halls closed. The summer crowds, once huge, moved on. The destruction caused by the Blizzard of ’78 provided a final blow. A handful of beach bars and ice cream stands — and the original Kelly’s Roast Beef — serve as reminders of those glory days. So do the pictures of Revere’s heyday that hang from the walls of local restaurants, as well as the intricately designed pavilions along the oceanfront promenade that hint at lost grandeur.

But while some people bask in Revere’s nostalgia, others have a vision for a future built on its colorful past.

“Mayor Arrigo approached me, and at first I was a little turned off about Revere,” said Michael Aldi, a Boston restaurateur and developer Arrigo courted to do business in the city. “I have family here, and I know what it’s all about, but it wasn’t there yet.” But Aldi saw promise in the oceanfront views and decided to take a chance: Last fall, he opened Dryft, the city’s first fine-dining restaurant, on the plaza overlooking the beach.

“My goal was to bring a Boston-style restaurant to the beach, something they’ve never had before,” Aldi said. “What I look for in a deal is parking, waterfront and, public transportation - and this deal had all three.”

Aldi plans to open a second restaurant on the Ocean Avenue strip. He believes that more tourism and retail business is on the horizon and wants to get in on the front end of the coming boom. “This is the oldest beach in America,” he said. “It almost reminds me of a New England-style Miami Beach.”

Some of this newfound glitz is driven by forces far beyond Revere. As in other lower-cost parts of Greater Boston — especially those with good MBTA access - newcomers have arrived in Revere in droves as rents have soared in the core of the region. Developers - and restaurants and retailers - have followed, gradually drawing a wealthier clientele.

That brings opportunity, said Rafael Mares, executive director of Neighborhood Developers, a housing nonprofit that works in Revere and Chelsea. But it also risks pushing out the immigrants and working-class renters who have long called the city home.

“The regional housing crisis has made people look in places they didn’t look before. Revere is one of them,” Mares said. “It’s like the ocean. We have this high tide that’s going up.”

One of the biggest waves is forming at Suffolk Downs, where plans for a huge new neighborhood are taking shape. About 40 percent of the vast, now- shuttered horse track is in Revere, and while the permitting has been slow next door in Boston, Revere officials in 2018 quickly approved plans for about 2,400 apartments, retail space, and a cluster of office buildings on the city’s section of the site. When it’s all built - years from now - the development will boost Revere’s commercial tax base by more than 50 percent, said economic development director O’Brien, and make room for white-collar jobs on a scale Revere has never seen.

It’s a long-term play, said Tom O’Brien (no relation to Robert O’Brien), managing partner at Suffolk Downs’ developer, HYM Investment Group. But it’s one he’s confident will long outlast the pandemic.

HYM is just now demolishing the old stables near the MBTA’s Beachmont Station. Construction on the first buildings won’t start until spring, O’Brien said, and by the time they open in 2023 he’s hopeful the public health crisis will be just a memory — and the Blue Line will again be a pipeline from the heart of Boston.

“We’re developers, so we’re always optimistic,” he said. “We see the bright side. But the bright side has typically worked out.”

Still, some worry all this change is too much, too fast. Especially now.

“There’s interesting growth happening, and a lot of resistance to the growth, as well,” Millar-Page said. “There’s a fear that people are going to be pushed out, and where do they go, especially during this COVID time. Where do you go if you’re already unemployed or furloughed?”

Her answer is to take steps to ensure current inhabitants will be able to stay as Revere evolves. That means reexamining transportation options to help people move around the city. It also means implementing programs to help service workers advance as their industries recover, and capturing some of those office jobs at Suffolk Downs.

It means building hotels, but also creating a tourism infrastructure to lure people who might not know there’s a fun beach resort close by Boston, while encouraging new residents to celebrate and patronize the immigrant-owned businesses that have made Revere unusual.

Some of those efforts are underway. The city released a draft master plan at the start of the year, with detailed recommendations for transportation, economic development, and housing. The plan is already providing a framework for recovering from the pandemic, with the city focusing resources on training programs for laid-off workers and allocating cash to help restaurants stay afloat.

Still, Arrigo said, today’s circumstances are unprecedented.

“There’s no handbook for this,” he said. “We’re just trying to make sure that we’re planning for and creating opportunities and a high quality of life for every single person in this city.”

The Boston Globe announced a new program that will allow people to ask the newspaper to update or anonymize past coverage of them online. The “Fresh Start” initiative is part of a broader effort to rethink the Globe’s criminal justice coverage and how it affects communities of color, amid a national reckoning over racial inequity.

“It was never our intent to have a short and relatively inconsequential Globe story affect the futures of the ordinary people who might be the subjects,” said Brian McGrory, editor of The Boston Globe. “Our sense, given the criminal justice system, is that this has had a disproportionate impact on people of color. The idea behind the program is to start addressing it.”

Jason Tuohey, managing editor for digital, said the Globe would consider all requests and would set an especially high bar for updating or anonymizing stories about public figures or serious crimes.

To apply, people fill out a short form online with an explanation of why they are requesting a review, including any relevant court documents.

Similar efforts have sprung up internationally in recent years as newsrooms grapple with the long-term impacts even minor stories can have in the digital age. The Cleveland Plain Dealer launched a similar online initiative in 2019, curtailing the use of mugshots and allowing people who have received court expungements to apply for their names to be removed from the site. The Globe’s initiative does not require people to get a court expungement, in which the court permanently erases a criminal record, before applying.

The Globe created a Fresh Start committee over the summer, made up of 10 employees from across the Globe newsroom and sister site Boston.com, Tuohey said. The committee reached out to a range of informal consultants, including formerly incarcerated people, professors of journalism ethics, and advocates for survivors of domestic violence.

Tuohey said the initiative is an experiment and the committee will examine each case individually. Possible outcomes include removing certain stories from Google search results or anonymizing names in stories.

Altering or delisting some information online raises thorny questions for media outlets that have long viewed themselves as the first draft of history, said Deborah Dwyer, a fellow at the Missouri School of Journalism who studies the ethics and practicalities of unpublishing.

“Are you going to accept requests from corporations? From government agencies?” Dwyer asked. “I caution people that just because it’s old doesn’t mean it’s not valuable.”

(Tuohey said the Globe would accept requests from individuals only.)

Dwyer said initiatives like this that require people to apply also raise questions about who will hear about them and therefore benefit.

The Globe plans to advertise the initiative through social media and sustained community outreach. Still, Dwyer said, a prominent white attorney who reads the Globe and was arrested for driving under the influence may be more likely to apply to have his name removed from an article than a Black teenager of lower socioeconomic status arrested for the same crime who does not read the Globe.

“Is it fair that only the people who raise their hand get a fresh start?” Dwyer asked.

Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel of the Committee for Public Counsel Services in Massachusetts, said the public defender agency welcomed the initiative, calling it “fantastic.”

Often, he said, clients of the CPCS are written about early in the criminal process. Reporters rarely follow up when the initial information turns out to be wrong or less serious than initially reported, he said. In other cases, people are convicted and serve their sentences, but when they apply for a job, articles about past misdeeds prevent them from succeeding.

“They’re trying to put their life back together and move on and be a productive member of society, and the press around whatever it was that got them into trouble continues to haunt them,” Benedetti said.

Tuohey said the initiative was part of a broader drive in the Globe newsroom to update criminal justice reporting.

“It’s changing how we look at our coverage,” he said. “If we change a story like this with the Fresh Start committee, why would we assign one like it next week?”

Yes, but not just old men. I discover that prostate cancer is extraordinarily common. Nearly 200,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with it every year, and 30,000 die from it.

The trials of 2020 sparked a new song for John Fogerty. “Weeping in the Promised Land ” — released, of all days, on Jan. 6 — touches on the Black Lives Matter movement, the pandemic, and the struggles of frontline workers.

He’s not just talking the talk.

A lifelong Fogerty fan, Boston Medical Center nurse Sarah Demers played Fogerty hits in her neurology and infectious diseases unit to brighten the mood.

“Music is very healing for us,” Demers said in a recent phone interview. “It puts a smile on all our faces [at the hospital]. His music symbolizes hope, strength; we can get through anything.”

And so she wrote Fogerty a letter a few months back, telling him how much his music means to her at BMC. She didn’t expect a response — but he sent her some face masks and a CD.

So she wrote back in January to thank him — this time commenting on how much his new song means to her as a nurse. Fogerty sent her a custom Fender acoustic guitar.

This week, Demers (and her co-workers) got another surprise: The former frontman of Creedence Clearwater Revival sent 10 Fender guitars to BMC. Demers and her co-workers unwrapped some of the presents Thursday.

“I’m a musician, so my initial instinct is to send music,” said Fogerty. “My wife, Julie, told Fender Guitars what we were doing and they jumped on board and donated a bunch of guitars. ... Music is just so healing and joyful. We all respond to it. We can’t help it, it’s in our soul. So, having the guitars in their breakroom, well, they can pick it up, sing a song, and feel good for a minute.”

While she doesn’t play guitar, Demers says she “might start,” adding with a laugh, “I was wondering if John could give me some lessons.”

She’s the co-creator of Dear Pandemic, a popular website that addresses common questions about COVID-19. Also a mom with her own older parents.

To answer these questions, I turned to Dr. Elissa Perkins, associate professor of emergency medicine, vice chair of emergency medicine research, and director of emergency department infectious disease management at Boston University School of Medicine/Boston Medical Center. She’s a mom with older parents, too.

Congratulations! If your 75-and-over parent scored a vaccine without you, middle-aged child, melting into a Zombie-like state in front of 30 open tabs trying to land them an online appointment, I applaud you. But now, new questions: Can they safely visit? Go on vacation with you? Hug grandchildren?

Here’s their advice.

Please, get the vaccine. Your parents might be concerned about side effects, especially if they have other conditions. Although there are very rare exceptions — and, of course, your parents should consult their physicians first — side effects from a vaccine are far less dangerous than actually contracting COVID-19 as an elderly person.

“For virtually everybody, the benefits strongly outweigh the risks of the vaccine. People with co-morbidities are likely to do far worse with COVID,” Perkins says.

Yes, there are side effects. Perkins had shaking chills and a fever. However, she says, these symptoms should resolve within 48 hours. Just plan to feel yucky for a couple of days.

Don’t expect instant immunity after your shots. Your parents — anyone, actually — will remain susceptible to COVID within 14 days of getting the first shot. That 14-day window, especially, is not the time to let your parents take kids for a mask-free weekend, despite the relief.

And, even after they’re fully vaccinated, they’re not immune.

Advertisement

“The temptation will be to change behavior once people are vaccinated, and they need to know within the first 14 days, they are not safe. Even after that, vaccines are 95 percent effective,” Perkins says.

That’s the catch: The vaccine isn’t a magic bullet. That said, even though it’s not 100 percent effective in preventing infection, it is effective in preventing severe infection and death, which is hugely reassuring. Just remember that your child can still transmit COVID-19 to an older person, though the impact should be less severe.

Ultimately, says Leininger, we need to get to a place where risk of transmission is low, risk of exposure is low, and risk of a poor outcome is low if you do still get COVID-19. We’re not there yet, and those stars need to align.

But are kids safe from grandparents? The tables have turned, Perkins says. Kids used to be the threat to grandparents; now it could be the other way around.

“Previously, I was terrified about getting my kids together with grandparents, frightened my children could unknowingly have COVID and pass it on to my parents, who would then get deathly ill. That’s much less of a fear. I am comfortable that my parents won’t get deathly ill — the vaccine is protective enough that it won’t cause death for them. However, I now have a fear that my parents can unknowingly have COVID and accidentally infect my children,” Perkins says.

The good news is, children appear to be remarkably resilient. More likely? A lesser infection that could keep them out of school with runny noses and fevers, says Perkins.

Advertisement

We’re not yet clear if people who have been vaccinated can still transmit the virus to others, though Perkins expects to know more in a month or two.

“Based on what we know about vaccines in general, and [about] this virus, I think there is a very good chance that we will find once you have been vaccinated, it’s unlikely for you to transmit it to someone else,” she says — making those grandparent-kid interactions even safer.

“When my children are with my parents, I still plan to keep them masked and not on top of each other. But there’s a noticeable shift in the risk,” she says.

What if my whole family is vaccinated? If you’re looking ahead to summer — maybe gathering at a beach house or going on a big family vacation after even middle-aged people get their jabs — Perkins is more sanguine. If everyone is vaccinated, she says, it’s much safer to gather indoors. But she still recommends taking “basic precautions, like keeping masks on, staying distanced, and making sure windows are open a crack,” she says.

A word about variants. We’re hearing about new variants from other areas, but Perkins believes our current vaccines provide “substantial immunity” against them, and that they could be further mitigated with a booster shot down the road. The current hurdle is getting more people vaccinated in the first place and racing against time to do that.

Advertisement

“Looking to the future in the next 5 to 10 years, we don’t have to worry too much. It is easy enough to adapt to variants, but what that means for the next three to six months is that we can’t count on the vaccine technology to mitigate the problems we will see,” she warns.

In Massachusetts, the rollout needs to ramp up. She hopes non-tech-savvy older adults can work with primary care doctors and other community resources, such as Councils on Aging, without relying on frustrating online registration systems. She also hopes that people younger than 75 will begin to get vaccinated in a “matter of weeks.”

Should your kid double mask around grandma? We’re also hearing a lot about double-masking to protect against more transmissible variants, but Perkins says that compliance is more important than adding fabric. Kids especially are accustomed to masking at this point, and telling them to change their patterns and slap on one more layer might actually have the opposite effect — improper wear and poor adherence.

“I am strongly in favor of prioritizing fit and comfort over a double mask. If we were to now introduce double-masking to them, I think we would lose compliance significantly,” she warns.

So, will summer look normal? Camps? Trips? Going to the beach without bringing an electric-shock fence? That’s the million-dollar question, but take heart: “Masking requirements aren’t going away before summer, but vaccinations, warmer weather, and increased knowledge will make summer look more normal,” Perkins says. “The one caveat is that new variants may throw a wrench into it. I hope we can up our vaccination game. But, overall, I would say that I believe the summer will look significantly more normal.”

Ask Len Libby matriarch Maureen Hemond: Lenny was her idea, back in the 1990s. “We were already making chocolate mousse candy, a soft center mousse dipped in chocolate,” she says. And she’d seen some sculptural chocolate creations on her travels. But an actual chocolate moose — the largest antlered animal in North America, no less — would be so fabulous, and so Maine. Her husband, Master Chocolatier Fern Hemond, wasn’t amused. “He thought we were crazy,” Maureen says.

SCARBOROUGH, Maine — Need more proof that New England is, indeed, the best place on the planet (and probably the wackiest)? Consider this: Maine is home to the largest chocolate moose — yes, that’s moose — in the world. His name is Lenny, he weighs 1,700 pounds, is 9 feet long and 7 feet tall, and has been making candy-crazed kids squeal with delight since 1997. Lenny resides in a blue-tinted white chocolate pond at Len Libby Candies, along with a 380-pound chocolate black bear named Libby and her 80-pound cubs, Cocoa and Chip. Gawkers are welcome, but don’t count on sneaking a piece of Lenny when nobody’s looking. “We’ve got a fence up now, because everybody wants a bite!” says John DeGrinney, who runs the business with his wife, Gisele. This edible ungulate may well be the largest chocolate animal — never mind moose — in existence. (“We’ve never heard of a larger one!” DeGrinney says.) Lenny has been featured on TV’s “Good Morning America” and in the board game Trivial Pursuit. Try finding another moose who’s done that.

But they did it, preparing the chocolate themselves and enlisting students from the Maine School of Art to make the moose. Steel beams and wire mesh support 10-pound blocks of real chocolate, which was applied like paste to the sculptural base. Sculptor Zdeno Mayercak, who had never worked in chocolate before, chipped away, one chocolate curl at a time, to make the life-like Lenny. (His inspiration, they say: The stuffed moose in the lobby of L.L. Bean in Freeport.) Project Lenny took a entire month and cost $50,000, Hemond says. Media outlets as far away as Europe picked up the story. The bear came along a few years later, to give Lenny some company. A video monitor plays the story of Lenny’s creation on a continuous loop.

Showcased in a woodsy-themed corner of the candy store, Lenny has attained celebrity status. “People who were here before bring their kids and grandkids,” DeGrinney says. “You can hear them squealing from across the building. It’s the best part of the job,” he adds. The shop sells little Lenny likenesses, in milk and dark chocolate, along with “moose on the rocks” (a chocolate moose with chocolate pebbles) and numerous other moose- and bear-themed confections.

But Lenny and company are just part of the sweet story at Len Libby. Libby, “considered the dean of Maine candy makers,” according to DeGrinney, opened the shop in 1926. It has always been a family business. Libby sold it to Dr. Fernand Hemond in 1949, and his son Fern (Maureen’s late husband) took it over in 1956; now, their kids and assorted nieces and nephews work alongside Maureen, age 81, John, and Gisele, who’s Maureen and Fern’s daughter. That’s four generations of candy-making.

They make 95 percent of the candy they sell, in a candy kitchen attached the shop. Besides Lenny, they’re known for their Maine Needhams, made with fresh coconut they crack themselves (“Nobody does it like we do,” DeGrinney says), and Bangor Taffy. The taffy, a rich caramel rolled in confectioner’s sugar, was served on the Maine Central Railroad more than a century ago. The company continues to make it using the original recipe.

Fans come to pay their respects to Lenny, but they always leave with a little something besides a selfie. This 5,000 square-foot space is filled to the rafters with goodies and Maine-themed gift items. This summer, the family hopes to open a viewing window to their candy kitchen, so customers can see the magic happen.

Speaking of magic, how is it that Lenny looks so fresh and dewy at 24 years old? Let’s just say he’s had some work done. “Every couple of years, we scrape him and clean him and put another layer of tempered chocolate on him,” DeGrinney says. Hmmm: Exfoliation, cleansing, a layer of chocolate — might be worth a try.

That is why I immediately said yes when the Globe’s Love Letters’ columnist Meredith Goldstein asked if I’d be interested in taking on this new monthly column devoted to self-help books with her. Part of me is still drawn to the idea that the solution to all my problems lives inside a book I just need the courage to open. Another part of me suspects that I, a Black queer woman, am not the target audience for these books—but still, the curiosity remains.

As a teen who was prone to whiling away hours in bookstores, I’d often wander through the self-help section. I couldn’t tell you why I — a relatively well adjusted Black teen — felt drawn to a genre that I associated with recently divorced white women. I don’t have any memories of actually reading the books, just running my hand along the spines, taking comfort in the idea that someone had answers.

Because it’s February and a certain holiday is lingering on the horizon, I figured there was no better way to start than with two books published this month on the subject of — say it with me — terminal singledom.

“Single and Forced to Mingle,” by Melissa Croce, Atria Books, $16.99

Ostensibly a guide to making your way through social situations as a single person — weddings, parties and the like — “Single and Forced to Mingle” was born of a viral tweet by Croce, who works in children’s publishing. Its style is akin to the chatty girl at your office who’s had a few glasses of wine at the holiday party and has been talking to you for a half hour, showing no signs of exhaustion. Croce clearly wants to make the case that it’s fine to be single, and I wholeheartedly agree, but that message gets a little lost in endless jokes and quizzes. If you’re a person who is truly wondering “What Kind of Chain Restaurant You Should Eat Your Feelings At?” depending on how your last relationship ended, this book is absolutely for you! I just kept looking for the actual guide part. It’s possible I’ve been single for long enough that I no longer feel awkward about mingling, but I think it’s more likely that societal expectations, like marriage and kids, forced on single, heterosexual women are not as present (yet!) for queer women.

It’s a fun, breezy read, and Croce is an entertaining writer, as long as you aren’t bothered by wink wink references to a certain subset of millennial culture — “rosé all day” and avocado toast come up very quickly. I did appreciate that she kept the references to former and potential partners gender neutral.

Who it’s for: People who like Buzzfeed quizzes; anyone who misses the Internet culture of 2015; anyone who has gone to more than three baby showers and/or engagement parties in a three month period.

“Single. On Purpose” by John Kim, HarperOne, $24

Kim’s book covers many things one would hope to find in a guide to getting from “alone and disconnected to alone and fulfilled”: how to make friends as an adult, the importance of having a healthy relationship with your body, learning how to be lonely. But it turns out it’s actually not that pleasant to read a book that encourages you to be vulnerable when it is coming from a man who is equal parts condescending and self deprecating. I suppose I could have expected to find the book’s tone off-putting, knowing that Kim goes by “The Angry Therapist,” and describes his approach to therapy as “self-help in a shot glass.” I had a hard time not tossing the book against a wall.

There are some interesting and helpful insights —like Kim’s insistence that long, lasting friendships are the kind of relationships we should focus on building. The problem is that all the good advice is lost in a sea of obnoxious language (“Like a stripper who uses the stage to get her power back.”) and derision for the women he dates (“yoga girl”) that gave me the impression Kim doesn’t particularly like or respect women, which made it rather challenging to take anything he said seriously.

Granted, the title of his previous book is “I Used to Be a Miserable [expletive],”and his self-deprecating schtick makes me think that when he writes about former relationships, he’s trying to point out he wasn’t giving his partners what they deserved, as a caution to readers not to repeat his mistakes. Unfortunately, the way Kim tells these stories is closer to “high school football player reliving his reckless youth” than “man who learned something about himself and how he treated women.” The book might be the most beneficial for anyone who identifies as a serial monogamist and is interested in trying to break that cycle. Or maybe you just have to be the kind of person who enjoys being lectured by a man in his forties.

In Senegalese yassa ginaar, slow-cooked onions melt into a sauce that’s brightened with lime juice and habanero peppers. In Colombia, a quick — and simple — homemade coconut milk serves as a base spiked with allspice, garlic, and turmeric. And in Morocco, chicken thighs and chickpeas soak up savory ras el hanout, a spice blend that includes cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, ginger, black pepper, and allspice.

Makes 4 servings

With just a few ingredients, yassa ginaar delivers multiple layers of flavor — savory yet sweet with lightly caramelized onions, citrusy with lime zest and juice, meaty from the deeply browned chicken, and spicy from the heat of habanero chili. Our version is based on a recipe in Yolele! by Pierre Thiam, in which the chicken is marinated then seared, then the marinade is used as a base for a flavorful sauce. Bouillon concentrate adds to the savoriness of the dish; our preferred brand is Better Than Bouillon. Serve with steamed rice.

The chicken shouldn’t be marinated for longer than two hours; the acidity of the lime juice will soften the meat. And steer clear of uncoated cast-iron pots. The lime’s acidity will react with the metal, causing the sauce to taste metallic.

4 tablespoons peanut oil, divided

3 tablespoons grated lime zest, plus 6 tablespoons lime juice

1 habanero chili, seeded and minced

Kosher salt and ground black pepper

2 teaspoons chicken bouillon concentrate (see headnote)

2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts, thighs, or drumsticks, trimmed

3 medium yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced

Finely chopped fresh chives, to serve

In a large bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons of oil, the lime zest, habanero, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Transfer 2 teaspoons of the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. To the remaining oil-zest mixture, whisk in the lime juice, bouillon, and ¼ cup water. Add the chicken and onions and toss. Cover and let marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate up to 2 hours, stirring once.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Set a colander over a large bowl and strain the onions, reserving both the marinade and the onions.

To a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat until barely smoking. Add the chicken, skin side down, and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat. Set the pot over medium heat and stir in the onions and ¼ cup water, scraping up any browned bits. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are softened and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Stir the reserved marinade into the onions. Return the chicken, skin side up, to the pot, nestling the pieces in the sauce, then pour in any accumulated juices. Reduce to medium-low heat, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the thickest part of the meat meets no resistance, about 25 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a serving platter or shallow bowl. Off heat, stir the reserved oil-zest mixture into the onions, then taste and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the onions and sauce around the chicken and sprinkle with chives.

Colombian coconut-braised chicken and coconut rice. Connie Miller of CB Creatives

Colombian Coconut-Braised Chicken and Coconut Rice

Makes 4 servings

Traditionally, pollo con leche de coco is made with fresh coconut milk. We found that canned coconut — both regular and light — to be so rich and heavy that it eclipsed the other ingredients. Instead, we opt to make our own coconut milk using unsweetened shredded coconut and hot water. The process takes only a few minutes and yields a light, flavorful milk that works beautifully in the chicken braise, as well as for cooking the rice. If you have a large enough blender, the milk can be made in one large batch rather than two smaller ones. For a shortcut, coconut water is an acceptable substitute, but the flavor will be less complex.

Use warm water when pureeing the shredded coconut — it slightly softens the shreds so they break down and release their flavor more easily.

4½ cups unsweetened shredded coconut, divided

2 tablespoons grape-seed or other neutral oil

1 teaspoon ground turmeric

1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped

8 medium garlic cloves, minced

1 tablespoon tomato paste

1½ teaspoons ground allspice

1 tablespoon soy sauce

Kosher salt

2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed

1½ cups long-grain white rice, rinsed and drained

1 tablespoon lime juice, plus lime wedges to serve

1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, quartered

In a blender, combine 2¼ cups of the coconut and 3 cups warm water.

Let stand until the coconut begins to soften, about 1 minute. Blend on high until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large measuring cup or medium bowl, pressing on the solids. Discard the solids. Repeat with the remaining coconut and another 3 cups warm water. You should have a total of 4½ cups strained coconut milk; set aside.

Set a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add the oil and heat until shimmering. Stir in the turmeric and cook until fragrant and the oil has turned yellow, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and allspice, then stir in 1½ cups of the coconut milk, the soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, then

nestle the chicken in an even layer in the liquid, cover, and reduce to medium-low heat. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink when cut into, 18 to 22 minutes, flipping the pieces once halfway through.

While the chicken is cooking, in a medium saucepan over high heat, stir together the remaining 3 cups coconut milk, the rice, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce to low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork and stir in any coconut oil on the surface. Drape a kitchen towel over the pan, replace the lid, and let stand.

When the chicken is done, use tongs to transfer the meat to a bowl. Bring the liquid in the pot to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced by about half and thickened, about 12 minutes. Pour in any accumulated chicken juices and simmer another minute.

Off heat, stir in the lime juice and tomatoes. Taste and season with salt, then return chicken to the pot, turning to coat. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with lime wedges and the rice.

Moroccan-style braised chicken and chickpeas. Connie Miller of CB Creatives

Moroccan-Style Braised Chicken and Chickpeas

Makes 4 servings

This skillet braise was inspired by a recipe from A Flash in the Pan by John Whaite. Look for ras el hanout in well-stocked supermarkets, spice shops, or Middle Eastern grocers, but if you cannot find it, substitute an equal amount of the more widely available garam masala. The flavor profile of the dish will become more Indian than Moroccan but still will be delicious. Serve with couscous or rice.

It’s fine if the chicken isn’t cooked through after browning; it will finish cooking after the thighs are returned to the pan with the apricots and chickpeas. Avoid browning the garlic and ras el hanout; their flavors will turn acrid. Cook, stirring constantly, only until fragrant, then pour in the sherry.

3 teaspoons ras el hanout (see headnote), divided

Kosher salt and ground black pepper

2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

4 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced

½ cup dry sherry

3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, divided

½ cup dried apricots, chopped

15½-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained

1 tablespoon grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice

2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

In a small bowl, stir together 1 teaspoon of ras el hanout, 2 teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, then sprinkle onto the chicken. Set a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil and heat until barely smoking. Add the chicken and cook until browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes; transfer to a plate.

Set the skillet over medium and add the garlic and remaining 2 teaspoons ras el hanout. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the sherry and 2 tablespoons of molasses; bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the apricots and chickpeas, then nestle in the chicken, browned sides up, and any accumulated juices. Cover, reduce to low, and cook until a skewer inserted into the chicken meets no resistance, about 20 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Set the skillet over medium-high and cook, stirring, until the sauce is thick enough that a spoon drawn through it leaves a trail, 3 to 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in the lemon zest and juice and the remaining 1 tablespoon molasses. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with cilantro.

Think back through the pandemic. Think about the moments that stand out as beacons in the haze — signposts of how it would change all of our lives.

Not all of these moments were clear at the time. China’s decision to shut down cities of millions of people in January was staggering, but to most Americans, this new coronavirus remained an ocean away, not something that would demand our own version of a lockdown.

Other moments form pits in our stomachs when we look back. Perhaps, for you, it’s when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention touted it was developing its own test for SARS-CoV-2 instead of relying on international designs. Or when leaders in New York delayed containment plans as cases built. Or when President Trump embraced the unproven and ultimately fruitless hydroxychloroquine as a miracle drug.

Then there were moments when the new reality arrived with the subtlety of a sonic boom. Take March 11: Trump halted most travel from Europe. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they had Covid-19. The NBA suspended its season.

Now — with health authorities saying it may not be until at least the end of 2021 before there’s a degree of post-Covid normalcy in our lives — look forward. Imagine the next 15 months and what life will be like.

In this project, STAT describes 30 key moments, possible turning points that could steer the pandemic onto a different course or barometers for how the virus is reshaping our lives, from rituals like Halloween and the Super Bowl, to what school could look like, to just how long we might be incorporating precautions into our routines.

This road map is informed by insights from more than three dozen experts, including Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates, people on the frontlines at schools and hospitals, as well as STAT reporters. It largely focuses on the U.S.

Perhaps making forecasts during what’s habitually described as “unprecedented” is foolish. “I’m kind of done predicting — none of my predictions worked out for me,” Kelly Wroblewski of the Association of Public Health Laboratories said, with a resigned laugh, about when she thought the testing problems that have dogged us from the earliest days might get resolved. And indeed, some of the events will unfold in different ways and at other times than we’ve charted out.

Yet for all that’s caught us off guard about Covid-19, some factors — like how a virus spilled from animals and swept around the world — are straight out of pandemic playbooks. We can see the coming crossroads.

So many challenges still lie ahead. Flu season. An ongoing child care quandary. A tumultuous election and potential transition of power. Whoever wins, we’ll need them to shepherd a vaccine rollout — a logistical and public relations campaign without (here’s that word again) precedent.

“The virus is not through with us yet,” said family physician and epidemiologist Camara Phyllis Jones of Morehouse School of Medicine. “The virus has only one job. And that’s to replicate itself, and to go from person to person to person — and it doesn’t care which person.”

Throughout the pandemic, what’s maddened U.S. public health experts has been the nation’s inability and unwillingness to take the steps that could reduce illness and death, steps that other countries have used with success. Instead, we’re trying to force the activities — commerce, schools, and festivities — that controlling the virus in the first place would enable but that, in our case, are contributing to infection counts.

“There’s this attitude that public health measures are getting in the way of opening up the country,” Fauci, the country’s most prominent infectious disease expert, told STAT. “It’s exactly the opposite. In a prudent way, the public health measures are the gateway, the vehicle, the pathway to opening the country. That’s the point that gets lost in this that’s so frustrating.”

As Fauci monitors the coronavirus’ trajectory, so do the rest of us, wondering what other hallmarks the pandemic will soon touch — like Thanksgiving feasts. At Adams Turkey Farm in Westford, Vt., they’re anticipating this year selling fewer of their “signature” birds around 24 pounds — “Oh my gosh, they’re beautiful,” said owner Judy Adams — and more smaller birds. The holiday meal will still happen; there just might be fewer people squeezing around the table.

“We’ve weathered different things — certainly not a pandemic — but I just trust in the holiday, I trust in the turkeys,” Adams said. “But if this is the year that we make less money, well, that will be OK, and we will get through this.”

Fall starts: Will it be wrenching, or really wrenching? Overstretched ambulance crews. Overflowing hospitals. Overstuffed morgues. The grimmest images from the spring and summer peaks could appear again this fall and winter if the country doesn’t drive its case count down urgently. “If we’re not going into the fall with a huge running start in terms of having cases at very, very low levels … we run the risk of having uncontrollable outbreaks,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. People are returning to offices or schools and interacting with others more. Residents of the northern half of the country, who embraced al-fresco summers, will move indoors. States and cities are inclined to keep easing restrictions. Then there’s the virus itself. While this is our first fall with SARS-2, experts believe that its activity could accelerate as temperatures drop, as is the case with other viruses, including the four coronaviruses that cause common colds. These viruses survive longer in cold, dry settings, tied to a measure called absolute humidity. But the virus spread like gossip this summer in the South. Was the heat really slowing it down? To an extent, experts think. But whatever advantage summer provided was overtaken by the fact that none of us was protected against the virus, and that restrictions like closing bars were lifted. “The summer epidemic probably would have been worse if it had been winter,” said disease ecologist Marta Shocket of UCLA. Some communities will have one partial shield this fall: a level of population immunity. Most people who recover from Covid-19 will be protected from a second case for some time, it’s thought. In hard-hit areas, 20% of residents or more have had the illness already — many without knowing it — meaning fewer people can be infected and spread the virus. “We’re not dealing with a situation like we were in February and March when it was a totally naive population,” said epidemiologist Wafaa El-Sadr of Columbia University. These areas have not reached herd immunity — when the percentage of protected people is high enough that the spread burns out — but, El-Sadr said, “it’s a plus.” Mathematical epidemiologist Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University has what could be considered an almost optimistic autumnal outlook: a flat number of cases, as increases in the northern half of the country offset declines in the South and some safeguards are kept up. But Chowell doesn’t imagine the real glass-half-full scenario: cases going down. “Having seen how U.S. society is split on face masks, I’m not very hopeful,” he said. It’s possible the fall won’t realize our worst fears. The flu season could be mild. Outbreaks in nursing homes and prisons could be prevented. But we’re approaching the danger zone with lots of virus circulating, when it was presumed that the country would be in a better position. Ahead of the fall, “we were envisioning that there would be a continued downward trajectory of Covid-19, new infections and deaths,” Brian Hainline, the NCAA’s chief medical officer, said in August. “That there would be a national surveillance system, national testing, and national contact tracing that would allow us to really navigate this pandemic and to resocialize both in sport and in the rest of society. And that hasn’t happened.” Sept. 28: A college quarantine strategy faces the test For colleges, there’s one over-arching dilemma: How can they safely keep students on campus? As we look for clues, the University of Wisconsin-Madison is one to watch. Desperate to contain the virus, the school this month mandated that residents of two dormitories and 22 Greek houses quarantine for two weeks. “I literally felt like I was being arrested,” one student told a TV reporter. As the students emerge in the coming days, it will become clear whether the gambit worked. If it does, it could show that universities might be able to hem in the virus and slog through this semester. If it doesn’t, it might be a sign that more schools will have to throw in the towel, following the likes of Colorado College and the University of North Carolina in canceling their in-person plans after students showed up. Some schools have gone from in-person to virtual teaching and then given in-person another chance. College clusters are fueling a sizable portion of new Covid-19 infections around the country. But some schools are soldiering on: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and schools in New England, for example, have unveiled ambitious testing schemes. Some are holding lectures in basketball gyms or in tents. But colleges, by design, bring packs of people close together. If cases crop up, they easily beget more. And if one thing’s clear from the start of the semester, it’s that college kids like to party, Covid or not. “It would be pure luck if you didn’t have clusters of cases” at some point during the semester, said epidemiologist Nita Bharti of Pennsylvania State University. The colleges that allowed students to return did so in part because it’s what students wanted. They pleaded they were missing out on spontaneous 3 a.m. philosophical discussions and intellectual breakthroughs that come only after a group all-nighter. But for the schools, it was also a grasp at a financial lifeline as budgets collapsed. “Universities are in such a hard place,” said Meira Levinson, an educational ethicist at Harvard. “They are educating people who have the transmission patterns of adults but who are developmentally not making choices the way older adults would.” The deeper impact of college closures could come if schools don’t sequester students before sending them home. Absent that, they could spray the virus across the country like shrapnel. Sept. 29: At first debate, Trump and Biden square off over Covid You can practically mouth the script: On stage at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland (and before a limited audience), former Vice President Joe Biden lambastes Trump for the nation’s disastrous pandemic response and for failing the American people. Trump tries to convince millions of viewers that the U.S. has turned a corner — that his administration defeated the virus and is this close to a vaccine. And with that, experts say, the election discourse poses real risks. Since the beginning of the pandemic, scientists have struggled to address Covid-19 misinformation from the administration. While they would normally advise looking to the Food and Drug Administration or CDC, the agencies at times have become megaphones for White House messaging. “We have offices that have credibility and we have noncredible people in those offices,” said Penn State’s Bharti. “That has created a disconnect for us for how to handle misinformation.” Trump’s attempts to paint a rosier picture of the situation could make it worse, experts say. If politicians prematurely declare victory, it sends the message that people no longer need to wear masks or distance from others. “I’m worried that if leaders say to the public like they did back in April or May, that this will be over, if those messages come back, it will confuse people again and we’ll see another surge in cases,” said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s really important for leaders not to sugarcoat things when they are not going well.”

Oct. 2: ‘A lost generation of workers’? Picture the cable news coverage of September’s unemployment report, a crucial proxy for the economy and the last one before the election. A flashing chart showing the pandemic’s toll on jobs, and an immediate pivot to the political implications. Trump will likely be watching. There had been hopes that the economy would bounce back from the depths of the spring in a V-shaped recession. Jobs returned as states allowed more business activity heading into the summer, but only to an extent, and hiring has since cooled. A bad or stagnant jobs report, then, could drive Trump to demand that states lift the remaining restrictions meant to keep a lid on Covid-19. But the central reason for the sputtering economy, economists say, is the uncontrolled epidemic. Government restrictions certainly dampened activity, but much of the persistent drag is because people do not feel safe traveling or hitting the town or spending money in their usual ways. “People look around and say, ‘the risks are too high, I’m not going to go about my activities,’” said economist Kosali Simon of Indiana University. This recession stands out for how quickly the economy cratered and for how it devastated select industries while leaving others unscathed. It’s also amplified the divide between white-collar workers who could slide into working from home, and lower-wage employees, many of whom lost their jobs or risked infection at their workplaces. The looming concern is that the pain may spread. Government spending has kept components of the economy treading water. If that support ends before a vaccine arrives, demand could collapse, unemployment could become long-term, and the recession could become entrenched. “We’re setting the stage for another decade of massive unemployment and a lost generation of workers,” said Harvard economist James Stock. A public health response is not only about saving lives, “it’s holding the economy in its hands.” The solution is not another lockdown, said Stock, who’s studying the effectiveness of interventions. Simple but sustained strategies, he said, can sufficiently drive infections down: donning masks, minimizing super-spreading opportunities, maintaining distancing, and restricting indoor activity. Build up testing. If cases get low enough, contact tracing becomes feasible. It’s essential that the country embraces these measures uniformly, Fauci said. “If one area in the country does it really well, and another area is careless and it surges up, that’s like playing whack-a-mole.” Early October: After 100 million tests, it’s still not enough It’s too early to say we’ve overcome all the horrors of testing, from a CDC test that didn’t work to shortages of swabs and reagents to delayed (and thus meaningless) results. But, perhaps, finally, things are looking up. “A lot more ubiquitous testing is coming,” Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s public health school, said at a STAT event in September. “I’ve been saying that for months, but maybe now it will actually be coming.” Faster and cheaper tests are becoming available, supported by a National Institutes of Health program. The Trump administration is distributing millions of antigen tests (which detect viral proteins) to nursing homes. Employers and universities have hatched ambitious testing strategies that could be models. A potentially more potent tool could also arrive in the coming months: rapid, at-home coronavirus tests, akin to pregnancy tests. This type of antigen test, which could use a saliva sample and is still in development, is not as accurate as PCR diagnostics (which detect the virus’ genetic material). But the vision is that it could offer individuals a pretty good clue as to whether they have infectious Covid-19 within minutes — information that would allow them to go about their lives (with precautions) or isolate themselves. “Having a test that can find you when you’re transmissible is the whole goal,” Harvard’s Mina said. Still, plenty of challenges remain. Experts say testing capacity needs to be expanded many times over. Test kits abound on movie sets and in professional sports, yet many people still have trouble locating one. Whatever national testing strategy exists is defined by deferring to states, leaving local labs more vulnerable to supply chain snags and to getting overwhelmed. “The idea of what a rational testing plan looked like — you know, we were on the phone with all the key people in the federal government in those key months [February and March], and it just didn’t happen,” Bill Gates told STAT. Mid-October: Can more K-12 schools get students back? Within two weeks of schools in Cherokee County, Ga., opening in August, when local coronavirus transmission was still high, more than 1,000 students and staff found themselves in quarantine and three high schools reverted to online learning. In the Northeast, as schools considered welcoming students for in-person instruction in September, communities generally had low Covid-19 rates — the surest signal that schools can reopen safely. But even there, last-minute snafus threw some plans into disarray, showing the difficulty of trying to hold together a strategy in a changing pandemic. New York City, which planned to open schools for a mix of classroom and remote learning Sept. 21, delayed for another week on Sept. 17. In Carle Place School District on Long Island, the superintendent made the call to switch to virtual learning two days before school started, after parties led to a spike in Covid-19 cases. “As we are learning the hard way, the actions of a few can impact the many,” Superintendent Christine Finn wrote in a letter to families. By mid-October, the northeastern schools that did welcome students back will be a month in — time for a report card on their strategies. Rhode Island, for example, opened schools in most districts, starting with some students as they moved toward full classes. There will also be signals whether schools that needed more time to get staff on board with in-person plans or to retrofit classrooms to meet safety standards can get kids back. Other countries have made it clear that low community transmission levels and rigorous strategies can enable schools to reopen and stay open. In a recent editorial in Science, researchers wrote that with distancing, limited classroom size, ventilation, and masks, “transmission within schools has been rare.” But in the U.S., schools haven’t been prioritized. In some places, movie theaters and gyms and indoor dining came back, even as local viral levels were deemed too high for in-person teaching. “We’re making choices that don’t necessarily make a lot of sense,” said Zoë McLaren, a health policy expert at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Cases will be detected at school, experts stress. The question is what happens then. Districts need plans for how extensive quarantines should be, how many cases would trigger a shutdown, and how long that should last. Returning to school, of course, is not just about the risk to kids, who are much less likely to get serious Covid-19 cases than adults. About 40% of teachers and 40% of adults living with children have health conditions that increase the likelihood of more severe Covid-19, according to one study. Many children live with a grandparent. Households have been key transmission points during the pandemic, and kids can’t isolate from their family. “If your kid gets sick, you’re probably going to get sick too,” said Maia Majumder, a computational epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. Mid-October: SARS-2 treatments start to arrive The first treatments specifically crafted to fight SARS-2 could join clinicians’ armaments this fall. Called monoclonal antibodies, they are designed to block the virus from slipping into cells. A number of candidates are in clinical trials, with results possible starting in October. The real boon could be if monoclonals keep patients with mild Covid-19 from progressing to more severe illness. They are also in earlier-stage testing to see if they can stop infection, akin to a vaccine. “What we really need are therapies that can be administered early to prevent someone from actually needing to go to the hospital,” Fauci said. “That’s the big gap that we have.” When the pandemic erupted, the world’s medicine cabinet was bare of any coronavirus therapies. Researchers adapted, finding that an experimental antiviral called remdesivir helped hospitalized patients recover faster and that common steroids reduced deaths. They’re exploring blood thinners to stop clots, and ways to calm overhyped immune systems that paradoxically cause many patients’ deaths. And then there’s the still maybe-beneficial convalescent plasma — an antibody-rich blood component donated by people recovered from Covid-19. Monoclonals have been seen as providing a bridge for the pandemic — a treatment for patients who get sick while vaccines are being rolled out. But there are questions about whether their development will take too long to make a real impact. There hasn’t been a significant push, for example, to manufacture them en masse. “It makes sense for something like Ebola, sure, when there aren’t that many people” who get infected at a time, said Juliet Morrison, a University of California, Riverside, virologist. But with Covid-19, “can we scale up to really do that for the whole population?” Oct. 22: The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee meets in a showdown over scientific integrity Usually, these meetings are eye-glazing to anyone beyond scientists and drug companies, yet another expert gathering in a conference room at the FDA’s suburban Maryland campus. But the topic will be Covid-19 vaccines, and given the timing — 12 days before the election — people nervous about potential White House interference in the FDA’s evaluations have this date circled on their calendars. At a routine meeting of these outside scientific advisers, the group might discuss the composition of that year’s flu shot or debate clinical trial data for a vaccine. At this one, it’s expected that results from Covid-19 vaccine candidates won’t be ready. Still, the (virtual) meeting could be a chance for the experts to build up a scientific bulwark against meddling from Trump — a moment when they will punctuate the importance of a rigorous review of immunizations, conducted only once adequate safety and efficacy data are available. “The medical science community must stop this dance as we get closer to rolling out a vaccine for Covid-19 because we now know that we won’t get any help from the federal government,” Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the Science journals, wrote in an editorial. “We’re on our own.” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has said that the meeting is part of the agency’s commitment to being “as open and transparent as possible” and that it will help the public understand “the data needed to facilitate [vaccines’] authorization or licensure.” Hahn has pledged that politics and pressure from the White House won’t force the agency’s hand. But the president has already accused the agency of harboring the “deep state” and slowing treatment development. He’s also staked his reelection on a vaccine, promising at the Republican National Convention that “we will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, maybe even sooner,” without mentioning the uncertainty around clinical trials. Oct. 23: A vaccine gets a divisive FDA emergency authorization OK, so this one might not happen. But if it does, imagine the juxtaposition. A spike-the-football Trump tweet, and scientists fretting that a hastily released vaccine desecrated the regulatory process. To be clear, there is a small but legitimate possibility that, should one of the vaccine candidates be wildly effective, clinical trials could demonstrate that by the end of October. Executives at Pfizer have said they could have results by then. But most experts think that the requisite data won’t be available until later. Everyone involved in the vaccine review process, including the companies testing them, says they are committed to ensuring the safety and efficacy of immunizations. And yet … experts still can’t shake the feeling that something untoward might happen before the election. Call it an October surprise, pandemic style. Perhaps the FDA will try to thread the needle. Hahn has suggested a possible authorization for a vaccine for certain populations, such as health workers. But the great fear is that, if some issue emerges with a vaccine after it is authorized, it will only steepen the uphill climb vaccine campaigns are facing. A not insignificant portion of Americans are dubious about Covid-19 vaccines. Unforced errors could only entrench their uneasiness. “If [the FDA] is bullied on this for vaccines, there are going to be a lot of people who stand up and say, ‘I wouldn’t get this vaccine.’ And then what you’ve done is you’ve scared people and you only get one chance to make a first impression,” Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in August. Even if a vaccine meets the standards for an emergency use authorization, it might still raise eyebrows. “The track record of the FDA for EUAs with Covid has not been good,” said UMBC’s McLaren, citing the flip-flop on the hydroxychloroquine EUA and the politicization around the convalescent plasma EUA. “The endgame is not vaccine No. 1,” McLaren said, noting that the world will need multiple vaccines to have enough supply. “If trust in the EUA pathway is further damaged with vaccine No. 1, it’s going to hurt vaccines No. 2, 3, 4.” Oct. 31: A scary Halloween indeed Parents, it may be time to have a difficult talk with your children. Los Angeles County has advised against trick-or-treating. Towns in Ohio have canceled public trick-or-treating events. And in Salem, Mass., a city of 43,000 that normally hosts a monthlong Haunted Happenings festival that welcomes half a million people, “pretty much all the events had to be canceled, rescheduled, or go virtual,” said Kate Fox of Destination Salem. Fox said people will still make the pilgrimage to Salem, but stressed that Massachusetts requires a negative Covid-19 test or a quarantine for people coming from most states.

Nov. 3: A momentous election indeed Perhaps nothing will change, or everything will. If Biden is elected, he has said his first post-election phone call would be to Fauci, with a request that the scientist continue his service. He has a plan to assemble a new team of health officials to guide the country out of the pandemic. If Trump is re-elected, don’t expect any major shifts in strategy. But it’s not Covid-19 policy differences driving voters, said Robert Blendon of Harvard, an expert on the intersection of politics and health policy. When it comes to the pandemic, voters are thinking pragmatically — how a Trump or Biden presidency would affect whether they can go to work and send their kids to school, or whether their businesses will survive. And, Blendon added, “What’s important to understand is that if there was some public health miracle in October, the polls would change dramatically.” November: Covid, meet flu In 2018, so many people came down with the flu that Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley Health Network threw up tents to handle the influx of patients. In April of this year, the hospital almost had to turn operating rooms into ICUs for Covid-19 patients. The question for Lehigh Valley is: What would a double whammy look like? “My hope is that with all the education of the public, maybe it’s not as bad,” Jennifer Rovella, the system’s chief of critical care, said about the approaching flu season. It’s clear why experts worry about a wave of Covid-19 coinciding with a bad flu season — what’s been dubbed the twindemic. But it’s also possible that all the precautions against SARS-2 will reduce transmission of influenza; the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season, for instance, was remarkably mild. Health officials aren’t taking chances. They’re warning that people could get infected by both viruses, potentially making them more likely to get seriously ill. They’re pleading with the public to get flu shots, which, even if they don’t prevent infection, reduce the chances of severe disease. “We’ve ordered about twice the number of flu vaccines as we normally do,” said Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania’s health secretary. Beyond the threat to health systems, distinguishing between the infections will be a head-scratcher for clinicians. Flu and Covid-19 have overlapping symptoms, including cough, fever, and aches. Doctors often don’t even test for flu and diagnose a case based on an exam, but they won’t be able to do that this year. Some tests that detect both viruses are being rolled out, but the urgency to tell if someone has flu or Covid-19 or both — with implications for isolation and contact tracing — could worsen bottlenecks. “You rely on the same laboratories and very similar testing supplies and equipment,” said the lab association’s Wroblewski. Thanksgiving: Will holiday travel set us back? Can you break a wishbone over Zoom? The thought of people traveling for Thanksgiving and the December holidays, at the same time that college students who make it through the semester will be scattering home, makes experts anxious, to say the least. Still, some families will get together. The safest way would be for everyone to quarantine for two weeks and gather with people within driving distance. Whatever the plan, they’ll need to have the Covid version of “the talk”: sussing out exactly what risks others are taking — are they seeing friends? are they going to the gym? — and establishing ground rules for the weeks leading up to the holidays. “People like to think their friends and family are like them, and their risk behaviors are the same as mine, but so often that’s not true,” said Boston Children’s Majumder. Summer travel was down by 15%, the first decline since 2009, with air, rail, and cruise trips taking huge dives, according to AAA estimates. But with the virus potentially and silently piggybacking on travelers, even pared-back holiday journeys could seed new spread. Family gatherings pose specific risks. The number of contacts people have over the holidays drops from regular days, but as demographer Audrey Dorélien of the University of Minnesota said, “the age of those contacts changes.” People could pick up the virus at work or at school or among friends, and then, in addition to the gravy boat, pass it to grandma and grandpa. Late November: The 250,000th American death When the official U.S. death toll hit 100,000, the New York Times dedicated its front page to the names of the dead. When it hit 200,000, Time put a black border on its cover for only the second time ever; the first was Sept. 11. How do you memorialize a quarter of a million Americans dead? “The numbers are so shocking compared to the numbers of people who are often commemorated on public monuments, like war dead,” said Kirk Savage, a professor of the history of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh. “That raises the question, if we’ve got more numbers, why aren’t we recognizing it?” We’ve grown a bit numb to the pandemic’s despair. We’ve cocooned ourselves from bad news, like we’ve trained ourselves to guard against SARS-2. But when the confirmed death count hits 250,000 (an undercount by some unknown amount), it might shake us out of our stupors. We’ll, for a time, consider the lives lost, and the family members who didn’t get to hug and kiss and hold their loved ones as they died. While the scale is difficult to comprehend, many have felt the impact. The staff at Carmon Community Funeral Homes in Connecticut faced an incredible sprint in March, April, and into May. They were arranging so many more funerals while adapting to the strictures of the pandemic. Churches weren’t open, so they found other spaces for services. They webcast hundreds of funerals. The firm typically arranges about 1,500 funerals a year. “This year we will probably have served over 2,000 families,” said John Carmon. The death count will mean different things to different people. Some might compare it to historical milestones or scale it to other data points: five times the number of U.S. combat deaths in Vietnam, the equivalent of 500 747s crashing, more than 80 Sept. 11ths. Savage, who studies monuments, thinks that such a tragedy ultimately deserves a memorial. It might not be a statue or wall of names, but “something ",Charting the pandemic over the next 12 months — and beyond

Winter in the northern United States will soon drive even the most diehard outdoor diners and backyard socializers indoors, bringing with them heightened risk for contracting and spreading Covid-19. The worry is not just that people might mingle more closely inside, but that the air they breathe will make the virus more dangerous.

Cold, dry air facilitates the spread of the coronavirus, and the social distancing that helped outside won’t be as effective indoors, scientists said.

“I do worry about this pandemic potentially getting worse this winter,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told STAT. “All the same kind of concerns that usually apply to other respiratory infections are the same with this virus.”

The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 will thrive this winter for three reasons: dropping temperatures, diving relative humidity, and drier respiratory tracts. When the weather turns cold, air gets drier. And turning on the heat dries both the air and the tissues lining the airways, impairing how well mucus removes debris and invaders like SARS-CoV-2.

Studies show significantly more infections happen and spread when the relative humidity falls from between 40% and 60% — a range typical in warmer weather — to 20%. That research draws from past outbreaks of flu and MERS, which is caused by another coronavirus. More recent case reports from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic’s early days in China and Seattle conclude the same thing: The virus stays stable longer and finds purchase on receptors in our airways better when the relative humidity sits at a wintry 20%. That’s one reason why we catch more colds and flu in cold weather.

Limiting the number of people in a confined space, wearing a mask, and ensuring good ventilation can help reduce the risk of infection indoors. But still, the viral particles from an infected person are unlikely to just blow away, as they might outside on a windy day. Consequently, the admonition for people to stay six feet apart may not be adequate in offices, schools, restaurants, and other indoor spaces, some scientists said. Even when social distancing outdoors, “six feet is not magic,” Iwasaki said.

Martin Bazant, professor of chemical engineering and mathematics at MIT, urges people to think “beyond six feet,” which is how he and his colleague John Bush titled their paper posted to the preprint server medRxiv last month.

“It was recognized early on that so-called superspreading events, which invariably occur indoors among persons separated by more than six feet, can only be explained by airborne transmission,” he said in an interview.

Models for indoor air assume that pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus are distributed uniformly throughout indoor rooms. “In such well-mixed spaces, one is no safer from airborne pathogens at 60 feet than 6 feet,” Bazant and Bush wrote.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued conflicting guidance. In September, the agency changed the information on its website about airborne transmission of Covid-19, first saying it could be spread beyond six feet through droplets or small particles in aerosols produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. Three days later, CDC removed information about aerosols and distances greater than six feet, saying a draft guidance had been mistakenly posted.

A CDC scientific brief posted Oct. 5 held to the six-foot standard: “Available data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has spread more like most other common respiratory viruses, primarily through respiratory droplet transmission within a short range (e.g., less than six feet).” The agency also said it found no evidence of routine, rapid spread to people far away or who enter a space hours after an infectious person was there.

“Unfortunately, 10 months into the pandemic, public health agencies are still reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission, let alone question the six-foot rule. Official guidelines still focus on large-drop transmission in coughs and sneezes, where six feet is an arbitrary distance for those droplets to settle to the floor,” Bazant said. “Aerosol transmission was previously implicated in the spread of SARS and measles with less evidence than we have now for Covid-19, so I am hopeful that change will come soon, as the scientific consensus grows.”

Bazant and Bush, an expert on respiratory fluid mechanics, have created a guideline to gauge the risk of airborne transmission that takes into account factors such as exposure time, room size, ventilation, and human activity. They designed a spreadsheet and online app intended to be simple enough for public health agencies to endorse and the public to use.

“Depending on ventilation, mask use, air filtration, and other variables, any indoor space may carry either low or high risk of transmission,” Bazant said.

Local regulations may govern ventilation in public places, but they don’t go far enough in the view of Yale’s Iwasaki. She and others are urging the World Health Organization to add relative humidity to indoor-air standards for such public places as schools and nursing homes. “It’s really to take action by setting the standard from 40 to 60% humidity, because that’s the optimal humidity for health and respiratory infection prevention,” she said about the online petition.

Pending such a move, there’s always the mask option indoors.

Masks are more effective than ventilation or air filtration because they filter aerosols and large drops at their source, as a person emits them. That means either more people can safely be in a room together or they can safely spend more time there, compared to a space that has only ventilation or air filtration.

Hospital intensive care units typically have negative air pressure ventilation — forcing out internal air — to protect their extremely ill patients, but that’s not necessarily the case for beds on regular floors, Iwasaki said, putting patients at risk.

Two other scientists have appealed to the medical community and public health bodies to provide more guidance about precautions for indoor spaces. “Hand washing and social distancing are appropriate but, in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people,” Linda Morawska of Queensland University of Technology and Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health wrote in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “This problem is especially acute in indoor or enclosed environments, particularly those that are crowded and have inadequate ventilation relative to the number of occupants and extended exposure periods.”

Iwasaki advises people to buy humidifiers for their homes, if they can. She has always told her children to bundle up with scarves over their noses when they go out in the winter, and she herself, back when she used to travel, always wore a mask on an airplane. She had three reasons: to prevent viruses from reaching her mouth and nose, to keep them warm, and to keep them moist.

“We don’t know where this is going to end up — we haven’t had a year with it yet,” she said about the pandemic. “I think we have to be extra cautious going into the winter.”",Covid-19’s wintry mix: Dry indoor air helps the virus spread

The hospital’s first employee to die of Covid-19 was a kitchen worker named Marie Deus. She was 65, and a longtime germophobe. Years before the pandemic, years before the new coronavirus was known to exist, she always kept a stash of masks and Purell in her bag. She was never without paper towels, to shield her hands from whatever unseen dangers lurked on doorknobs, on handholds in the bus. She’d come home from the grocery store with Lysol, Pine-Sol, ammonia, Clorox. She didn’t just like rooms tidy; she wanted them spotless and disinfected.

“She wasn’t that way when she was in Haiti,” said her sister, Yolanda Desir. It was only after she moved to Boston in her 20s that her fear arose. Growing up, she’d dreamed of becoming a nurse; in a new country, with its unending rush of bills, she needed a job fast, and becoming a nursing home assistant seemed like the next best thing. She liked the work, but she knew how easy it would be for her to catch something, spending days with patients, leaning close enough to spoon-feed them.

She avoided touching things, made a ritual of washing her hands. She kept doing it when she got the job at Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital 15 years ago, scrutinizing surfaces, wary of anything that might not be clean. “Terrified she’d get sick,” said her colleague Antonette Brade. Extreme as it might’ve been, the fixation made Deus a model kitchen worker, a ringleader of hygiene, a hand-sanitizer-in-chief. “Everybody was pleased with what she do,” Brade said. When the pandemic arrived, she only seemed more prescient.

Her family had gently ribbed her about her obsession; it almost seemed like a kind of superstition, and they teased her about that too, laughing at the books she used to interpret dreams. Occasionally, she’d stop in at the corner store after work to pick out lottery tickets, and the numbers she chose always came from those books. She loved sitting in the kitchen with her niece, watching Nigerian movies, and she’d translate the plot twists into auspicious numbers to play. If she had a dream about a car, she’d play the digits of the license plate. If she dreamed about you, she’d ask how old you were and play your age. Sometimes she won — $500, $700, $1,000 — nothing huge, no quit-your-job jackpots, but enough to convince her that she was onto something.

“Because she knew, if you can’t come to work, sooner or later you may be losing your job. … That’s the only way we can keep up in America, you know?” Daniel Joseph, lead cook at Faulkner hospital

The morning she collapsed began like any other, getting up before sunrise, catching the bus in the gathering light. She liked being early. She liked arriving an hour before she was expected, whether going to work or taking her niece to ballet. On weekdays, she’d leave the house by 5 or 5:15. She’d change into her uniform — blue shirt, black pants — have coffee, eat a piece of toast. If the opening manager were a minute late unlocking the kitchen, she’d be there by the time clock, waiting, ready to punch in. “Bonjour, Marie, bonjour,” he’d often say, his American accent trying to fit inside the French words.

She’d been sick in the days before, tired and sneezing. Allergies, she insisted. Her sister kept asking if she had fevers, chills, anything that could be a sign of coronavirus? No, no, no, Deus replied, nothing like that — and it made sense. “She was the last person you would believe would have corona,” her sister said. She took a few uncharacteristic days off to rest, and by April 1, she was her usual workaholic self, anxious to be back.

“Don’t forget, we’re foreigners,” said her friend Daniel Joseph, a lead cook at Faulkner, who’s also from Haiti. Even after decades in Boston, the feeling could be hard to shake: the constant wariness, the knowledge that at any moment, even the most meticulous life could come apart. Deus often told him that if the hospital cut staff, she’d be first. She was older, she said, her English imperfect.

To him, that was why she was always early, always hand-washing, always terrified of getting sick. “Because she knew, if you can’t come to work, sooner or later you may be losing your job. … That’s the only way we can keep up in America, you know?”

That morning she hardly made it past the door. She was by the checkpoint where everyone was screened for coronavirus symptoms when she collapsed. A team rushed out of the emergency room with a stretcher, and carried her in. The doctor on duty, Luis Lobon, recognized her right away. She was someone he saw all the time, wheeling a trolley of meal trays to patients, someone he said hi to, but didn’t know well. Now, it scared him. I might be the last person she ever talks to, he thought.

She wasn’t gone yet. She wasn’t lethargic or somnolent or drifting in and out. Instead, she was electric, wide-eyed, using every bit of her energy to keep herself alive. She stared at Lobon with terror, with the knowledge that she was trapped somewhere airless and awful and needed help getting out. “That classic look of the really bad asthmatic,” Lobon said. “This very, very penetrating look, almost like they’re drilling through your brain.”

She didn’t want to be intubated, didn’t want to be taken to the ICU. She wanted to talk to her sister. Though there wasn’t much time, someone handed her a phone, and Desir soothed her, said it was OK, a ventilator might help her breathe — but then Deus’ vital signs started plummeting and Lobon interrupted to say sorry, he needed to put her to sleep, she would be OK, she should say goodbye to her sister until they could speak again.

The IVs and sedatives were already in place. As he threaded in the breathing tube, Lobon noticed that the muscles of her airway, which should have been red with oxygen-rich blood, were now grayish. Everyone in the room was tense. If a hospital kitchen worker were infected — someone who didn’t spend much time with patients — what did that mean for them?

Lobon was worried for Deus, worried for his staff, worried for himself. When he caught the eye of a colleague from behind his goggles, what he saw through her face shield wasn’t so different from the petrified stare he’d gotten from Deus. “She looked at me like, ‘Oh my goodness, this is one of us. … Who’s going to be next?’”

Luis Lobon, chief of emergency medicine at Faulkner Hospital, was the doctor on duty when Deus collapsed.

Her illness was part of a pattern, but not the one her clinicians were worried about. Deus was among their first Covid-19 patients, just as the Faulkner’s curve of cases was about to get steep, and they expected that they — doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists — would be at the greatest risk of infection. They were on the front-most of the front lines, pressing electrodes onto skin, listening to the fluid-filled crackle of lungs, suctioning out secretions.

But they weren’t the employees getting sick at the highest rates. Among the 25,000 or so people who staff the hospitals and clinics of Brigham Health, certain units that didn’t have much patient contact were testing positive more than their bedside colleagues. By mid-April, 4.1% of environmental services workers were infected — though they wore protective gear when cleaning patient rooms — while 1.2% of nurses were. The percentage was 2.7 for those like Deus, who prepared and delivered food, which was similar to that of respiratory therapists, who fiddled with Covid-19 patients’ breathing tubes.

Overall, about 1% of employees were infected — and that proportion stayed the same when you divided those who provided direct care from those who didn’t. The transmission didn’t seem to be originating with patients. In fact, ever since late March, when they’d started requiring everyone onsite to be masked and to declare any possible symptoms at the door, epidemiologists hadn’t seen a worker infection they could trace back to a patient as its most likely source, said Chuck Morris, one of the hospital’s pandemic incident commanders, on April 15.

That left the question of where these unexplained cases were coming from. Morris wondered if they might be linked to the city’s coronavirus hot spots, or to some unseen crack in the hospital’s infection control, or both. Either way, Deus’ story made the numbers harrowingly real: They contained not only the risk of further spread, but also the possibility of more people like her, sick enough to become inpatients at their own workplaces.

The data weren’t perfect. Some divisions had 20 or so employees; others had hundreds, and a few had thousands. There were enough cases to show there was a problem, but not enough to pinpoint why it arose. Plus, hospital leaders knew they were probably missing some. While coronavirus testing was accessible to all employees — if you had symptoms, you could get swabbed — environmental services and food workers weren’t getting them as much as nurses and doctors. “As much as I feel like we try to flatten hierarchies,” chief medical officer Sunil Eappen said, “there is a hierarchy here.”

Tackling the curve, he knew, would mean tackling that, too. “’If I’m symptomatic and I step out of work and I test positive, do I have job security?’ You do, but are we sure that you know it?” Eappen went on. “‘And if I get sick, am I covered?’ There was definitely reassurance that went out about both of those issues … and even despite that, you might still be scared.”

Desir’s apartment building in the Mattapan neighborhood of Boston.

Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital

When Desir got the call from the emergency room, and heard her sister gasping for air after every word, she immediately thought about her nephew. He was in his 30s, working as a concierge in a downtown high-rise, and he’d been coughing, too. They all lived together, with Desir’s 11-year-old daughter, four people in a three-bedroom. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?’”

She was sitting at her desk, at another hospital, where she helps figure out how much of a procedure will be covered by insurance, how much a patient will have to pay. Hearing snatches of what was going on, her boss let her go home. By the time she brought her nephew to Boston Medical Center later that day, he was so weak he sank into a wheelchair. That night, he was back in his own bed, self-isolating, waiting for coronavirus test results.

They were positive. Desir kept her daughter as far from him as the space would allow, but someone had to take care of him. Cautiously, a few times a day, she brought him water and food, so he wouldn’t have to leave his room. She’d make him tea from mint and mugwort and bay leaf, have him gargle water with lemon and baking soda and salt.

She worried he would end up in the same state as his mother, hospitalized, organs damaged, unable to talk. By now, she’d been transferred from the Faulkner to the Brigham. The house felt strange without her. Marie the workaholic, leaving for the hospital long before she had to; Marie relaxed on her day off, dredging fish fillets in flour with her niece, rolling meatballs she wouldn’t eat herself. Marie, who was 10 years older, part of the reason that Desir had come to Boston from Haiti in the first place.

They’d lost their parents early, to a car accident, and they were raised in Port-au-Prince by their uncle. He also hosted their cousins from the countryside, who’d come down to the capital for school, and the house was bursting with kids, everyone like a sibling to everyone else, swapping clothes and shoes. They grew up minutes from the Palais National, Haiti’s domed-and-columned answer to the White House, with a line of stately palm trees out front, like sentinels. It was a desirable neighborhood, favored by intellectuals — “pretty much in the center of everything,” Desir said.

Yet it was also at the turbulent center of everything under the Duvalier regime, infamous for the secret police force known as the Tontons Macoutes. Named after a mythological bogeyman, a child-snatcher who stuffs his prey into a big gunnysack, they were agents of disappearance, arriving with machetes and guns and taking people away. Their targets were exactly the sorts of journalists and academics who lived on Desir’s street. As a teenager in the late ’70s, she would see them near her house, their presence a source of terror. “They even come to my school,” she said. “They come in and they hunt some of the teachers.”

The neighborhood they knew began to empty out. Her uncle had already left some 15 years before, fleeing the repression of the Duvalier family’s first dictator. Around that time, Haitian scholars say, their country acquired an extra, unofficial province, its territory stretching from the Bahamas to Miami, Brooklyn to Montreal, Dominican sugarcane fields to Parisian arrondissements. As Desir put it, “That generation, they moved all over the world. Canada has a lot of teachers thanks to Duvalier.”

In 1980, Deus joined their scattered ranks, following her uncle to Boston. Desir wasn’t far behind. The city held the third largest enclave of Haitians in the United States, and its epicenter was a neighborhood called Mattapan — an area of triple-deckers with its own history of comings and goings.

In the unrest that broke out after the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, a group of bankers wanted to look like they were doing something, anything, to address racial inequality. What they did was to draw a blue line around certain tracts of Boston, pinpointing sections of the city where they would offer Black families loans. It was a kind of shadow redlining: Rather than keeping people of color from getting mortgages and buying homes, as governments and banks and realtors had done since the ’30s, now these suits-and-ties were providing lines of credit — but only within those geographical confines.

The story was often told to explain the re-segregation of Boston, and specifically, how Mattapan went from majority white to majority Black. Yet the shift had already started earlier in the 1960s. Black families, some displaced by demolitions, began settling in areas that white suburbanites-to-be were leaving — and speculators dove in, scaring residents into selling, flipping houses at a profit, providing neither repairs nor the inspections that would have revealed the need for them. As demographics shifted, racist officials downgraded property values. “Once African Americans start settling in Mattapan, all the white institutions of our society start saying this isn’t a desirable neighborhood,” said Gerald Gamm, a professor at the University of Rochester, whose book, “Urban Exodus,” is about that change.

That meant space was affordable for the pioneers of the Haitian diaspora, who founded churches and opened shops, and it was into this landscape that Deus and Desir arrived, staying at their uncle’s until they could find work and housing of their own. Their current apartment is a 15-minute bus ride north of there. They each had stints in other places, but for the past decade or so, Mattapan has been home. Each wave of new arrivals could talk about the forces in Haiti that brought them here: one Duvalier dictator and then his son, earthquake and hurricane, food shortage and political turmoil.

Back in the day, they understood themselves to be Haitian, first and foremost, no matter how people in the US saw them, explained Carline Desire, executive director of the Association of Haitian Women in Boston. Yet slowly, identities shifted, still Haitian, but becoming American as well.

In many ways, Deus’ career was familiar in her circle, the years of work in a nursing home, the transition to a more stable job in a hospital. The way Desir was caring for her nephew wasn’t so different from what Deus had been doing for a living all along, feeding patients, often surrounded by other Haitian-Americans, some her clients, some her colleagues. When nursing home residents asked, she’d make them joumou, winter squash soup. When she got to the Faulkner, and was assembling patient meals on the tray line, she’d sometimes sing her favorite Haitian crooner classic, and the others who knew it would join in:

“Marie, tu es très charmante,

Tu es une rose san pareil.”

Marie, you are so charming,

A rose like no other.

Desir near her home in Boston.

Desir imagined her sister had caught the virus in her work at the hospital, but she couldn’t be sure. She didn’t blame anyone for her sister’s illness. No matter how careful you were, she said, there were still risks that came with working in health care, with going to work in general. “That’s the thing about corona, you don’t know where you can get it,” she said. “It’s everywhere and nowhere.”

The hospitals’ infection trackers sometimes felt something similar. Certain cases were straightforward, with no breaches in personal protective equipment but a clear exposure to a family member whose symptoms clearly predated the employee’s — or, in the pandemic’s early days, close contact with a surgery patient who’d only been revealed to have coronavirus after a while in the hospital. But other cases were fuzzier. Could anyone remember if a specific patient was wearing a mask? What if the employee lived with a family member whose symptoms began right around the same time? What if that family member also worked for the hospital?

Their task lay in the details — who’d had lunch in the break room, how many minutes spent with a patient, who lived with whom. Just as Deus’ sister and son had both spent time employed at the Faulkner, one dealing with patients’ finances, the other wheeling them from place to place, for many, hospital work was a family affair. Yet behind those micro-patterns were larger ones, visible only if you zoomed out.

For years already, the Brigham and its sister hospitals had been tracking the ZIP codes of some patients, geocoding immunization rates and cancer screenings, looking at geographic fluctuations in outcomes for patients with hypertension and diabetes. “You are at higher risk of not achieving good blood pressure control if you live in Chelsea, or if you live in Roxbury or Mattapan,” said Thomas Sequist, the Mass General Brigham hospital system’s chief quality and safety officer. One of his first questions, upon seeing more infections in certain groups of employees, was: “Where do our health care workers live?”

By late April, after Deus had been on a ventilator for weeks, the hypothesis around illnesses like hers had shifted. Though the number crunchers were still crunching their numbers, they could see the beginnings of a trend. At Brigham Health, just 0.7% of doctors lived in the Boston area’s coronavirus hotspots, while 5% of nurses did. Among both environmental services and food workers, that proportion was above 40%. Geography, it seemed, might be a better explanation than job description. “It doesn’t matter if you’re working as a nurse, or a medical assistant, or in food services,” said Morris, the Brigham’s incident commander. “Living in certain areas of the city increases your risk.”

By June, the numbers would be even more convincing. The nurses who lived in hotspots had a 4.3% infection rate, while it was 2.3% for those whose addresses were elsewhere. Among food workers, 9.9% of hotspot residents had tested positive, while 3.2% of those from other ZIP codes had. For hospital employees, being on the front-most of the front lines wasn’t just about the patients you worked with, but also the zones in which you lived.

That didn’t mean your job in the hospital was irrelevant. Environmental services and food workers’ jobs didn’t require them to be obsessive email checkers the way physicians’ did. Try as a manager might to convey official messages about the hospital’s ever-evolving pandemic policies, that wasn’t foolproof. Hospital leaders had started holding distanced meetings with workers who were most affected. They heard confirmation that some were afraid to be tested, afraid they’d lose their jobs if sick. They set up a multilingual texting service, so that information would ping onto phones in the language of your choice, in a medium these teams actually used.

But that was only part of the story. The other part lay in the very air and architecture of the city, in the discrimination that has shaped who lives where, with how much. It was coiled into the anxiety of “keeping up in America,” as Deus’ coworker Daniel Joseph put it, which for him means working two jobs, one full-time at the Faulkner, one part-time at an assisted living facility.

He lives in Mattapan, too — a neighborhood of essential workers, where getting to work often means taking the bus, where making ends meet often means a patchwork of nursing home gigs that don’t necessarily provide benefits or proper PPE. It was the ZIP code with the second highest coronavirus rate in Boston, where 24.3% of those tested have been positive.

To Dieufort Fleurissaint, associate pastor at Voice of the Gospel Tabernacle, a Haitian church, it was partially a question of economics: The vise-grip of Boston housing prices only becomes tighter if you’re sending part of your paycheck back to Haiti, or hosting the newest arrivals as they get on their feet. “I know a house of three bedrooms that had two families, and each family has four children, and you can imagine the parents are working in a nursing home,” he said. “If one person is infected, the whole household is infected.”

That’s layered onto a long, long history of structural racism, visible in everything from hypertension geo-data to police violence. “The virus — that hasn’t left anybody’s mind. But there are other factors that are just as deadly,” said Fatima Ali-Salaam, chair of the Greater Mattapan Neighborhood Council. “I’ve heard plenty of people say, if it’s not this virus, it’s going to be something else … look at the average lifespan of communities of color.’”

She saw that in the 20 people she knew who’ve died of Covid-19. Fleurissaint saw it in the unending stream of online funerals he and his Haitian pastor colleagues faced: “Every day in April, two, three people passed away.”

Joseph Kim, an internal medicine resident at Brigham and Women’s, kept Deus’ family updated on her status as Covid-19 restrictions kept them from visiting the hospital.

Whenever he had a difficult phone call to make, Joseph Kim would find a secluded spot, away from the hum of doctor talk and foot traffic. One of his favorites was a storage closet on Brigham and Women’s ninth floor, which held an ultrasound machine and a stand of oxygen tanks and just enough unimpeded floor for him to pace.

He was 28, an internal medicine resident, and he’d found himself ducking in there more and more lately, to update families who couldn’t visit their Covid-sick relatives. That was where he told Desir that, as her sister’s health care proxy, she’d soon have to make a choice. Deus’ heart and kidneys were fragile from their lapse in oxygen, her lungs papered with scars. After weeks at anchor in her windpipe, the ventilator’s plastic tubing posed an ever-growing risk of injury that would eventually outweigh its help.

“You can’t keep someone on a ventilator forever,” Kim said. “It has to be a bridge to something.” He hoped it would be a bridge back to unassisted breathing, but when they tried tapering the airflow, her lungs couldn’t draw in what they needed on their own. That left two possibilities, diametrically opposed. The doctors could keep trying, with even more instruments — food entering the gut by surgical conduit, breath whizzing in through a slit in her throat — or they could withdraw all treatments but those that helped her stay comfortable.

For Desir, it was hardly a choice. Deus’ years of nursing-home work had left her with a profound fear of becoming one of the people she cared for, daily rhythms dependent on aides and tubes. When Desir relayed the doctor’s description — more time in the ICU, a long stretch of rehab if she recovered — her family said, no, no, no, you couldn’t do that to her. “They would have to put her in one of those houses she never liked,” Desir said. “She work in them, she doesn’t want to be in them. She just feel that if she can’t live the way that she like, she might as well go to the Lord.”

Every coronavirus case, Kim knew, was a fuzzy snapshot of a life. He couldn’t talk to Deus herself. Often, he couldn’t even see her up close, but only from a protective distance, peering in through the window of her room, examining her through her lab values, hearing her voice through his storage-closet calls with her sister. He couldn’t know her Port-au-Prince self, her Mattapan self. He hardly knew her at all. Yet he’d rotated through the Faulkner, knew the wards and hallways where she had spent her days. Always, he carried some bit of hurt home with him, but this time, the loss felt closer, more personal.

The priest came on a Tuesday evening, to give Deus the last rites. Kim called Desir afterward to say her sister was sleeping, that she should try to sleep, too. The next morning — after a final, unsuccessful attempt to coax Deus’ lungs into breathing on their own — the clinicians asked whether Desir and her nephew wanted to come in for a last visit. It was April 22. They hadn’t seen her in three weeks.

She wasn’t awake when they arrived. They spoke to her anyway, through their layers of protective gear, telling her they loved her, each putting a reassuring hand on her skin. Her sister prayed for her, asking God to receive her, to make sure she would be cared for the way she had always cared for them. “And I said my goodbye,” she said, “told her I would see her on the other side.”

Then, they gathered up the things she’d had with her on the day she collapsed. That morning had been cold, the air near freezing at dawn as she’d left her house. They took her blue jeans, her puffy gray coat, the long wig she liked to fit over her hair and tie into a ponytail. The nurses said they were sorry that the circumstances were so difficult. “One nurse came to me,” Desir recalled, “he said, ‘When I told her that her son is fine and that he’s back to work … I’d never seen her so peaceful.’”

In the long days afterward, Desir forced herself to go into her sister’s room, to pack up her belongings, so a friend could take them back to Haiti and give them away. Everywhere, she found the remnants of germophobia: Purell bottles in pockets, masks and disinfectant wipes at the bottom of a purse. It was too much. Just before Deus had gotten sick, the four of them were about to move, out of their apartment in Mattapan to a single-family house in the suburb of Randolph, with a garden and a basement and what felt like a cavernous amount of space. They were supposed to sign the papers on April 30. “All we had to do was the closing,” Desir said.

But neither she nor her nephew could stomach moving into those rooms, where they’d imagined Deus picking out curtains, queuing up an endless stream of Nigerian films. Nor could they keep living where they were, remembering, every time they passed her door, how Deus liked to sleep with the light on, how they would always see the comforting yellow glow of it filtering out into the hall.

They started their search from scratch. It was a strange mourning ritual, clicking through listings, looking at square footage and pictures. On weekends, while waiting for the church to reopen so they could hold a proper funeral, Desir drove from town to town to town, passing through kitchens and backyards, trying to imagine what their lives might be like if this were where they lived.","In the death of a hospital food worker, a microcosm of the pandemic"

After briefly falling behind, Williams swept 10 consecutive games and beat Laura Siegemund, 6-1, 6-1, on the first day of the tournament Monday.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Serena Williams had a wobbly start at the Australian Open — for one game.

“This was a good start — vintage ’Rena,"" she said. ""It’s definitely good. I’m pretty good at pacing myself at a Grand Slam.”

Williams wore a colorful one-legged catsuit, and her game looked flashy, too. She lost only nine points on her serve and hit 16 winners.

Her sister, Venus, won a Grand Slam match for the first time since 2019. Playing in her 21st Australian Open, the elder Williams beat Kirsten Flipkens, 7-5, 6-2.

At 40, Venus is the oldest woman in this year’s draw and just the sixth player in her 40s to compete at the Australian Open.

Three-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, who won the title in Melbourne two years ago, played the opening match in Rod Laver Arena and beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, 6-1, 6-2.

The first tournament of this year’s Grand Slam season began after a three-week delay because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“Physically I feel like everyone, their bodies are shocked, coming in and playing so suddenly after such a long break,” Osaka said. “I think we’re all getting used to it and everyone is just happy to be here.”

That includes the Williams’ sisters.

“Listen, this is amazing,” Serena said. “Last year was very scary for the world. To be able to do what I love and be able to come out and compete … it makes me appreciate the moment even more.”

Canadian Rebecca Marino, a former top-40 player competing in a Grand Slam event for the first time in eight years, beat wild-card entry Kimberly Birrell, 6-0, 7-6 (7-9). Marino was sidelined by depression and a serious foot injury.

In early men’s play, No. 14-seeded Milos Raonic defeated Federico Coria, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. American Reilly Opelka hit 18 aces and beat Lu Yen-hsun,, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3.

Serena Williams overpowered Siegemund, moved well and saved one of her best shots for the final game, racing forward to flip an off-balance backhand off her shoestrings for a cross-court winner.

For the past four years, Williams has been trying to equal Australian Margaret Court’s record of 24 major titles. Williams’s most recent Grand Slam championship came at Melbourne in 2017.

Osaka drew a potential tough opening opponent in Pavlyuchenkova, a Russian ranked 39th who reached the quarterfinals in Melbourne three of the past four years.

But Osaka breezed through the first set in 21 minutes and barely slowed after that. She finished with more winners than errors and lost only five points on her first serve.

Up to 30,000 fans — about 50 percent of capacity — will be allowed on the tournament site, but seats were mostly empty for the early matches on a cool day.

Recited Gorman:

Gorman read an original poem Sunday during the pregame festivities in Tampa, Florida. The poem, titled “Chorus of the Captains,” was a tribute to three people for their contributions during the pandemic: educator Trimaine Davis, nurse manager Suzie Dorner and Marine veteran James Martin.

NEW YORK (AP) — Amanda Gorman, the 22-year-old poet who stirred America at the inauguration of President Joe Biden last month, again commanded the spotlight on one of the country’s biggest stages, the Super Bowl.

“Let us walk with these warriors,

Charge on with these champions,

And carry forth the call of our captains.

We celebrate them by acting,

With courage and compassion,

By doing what is right and just.

For while we honor them today,

It is they who every day honor us.”

That Gorman brought poetry to the Super Bowl was an almost unthinkable collision of grace and glitz. But if the Super Bowl, an annual rite of excess, was an unlikely platform for a poet, it showed just how much Gorman has seized the nation’s spotlight since the inauguration.

Gorman, previously the country’s first National Youth Poet Laureate, was the youngest person to ever recite a poem at the U.S. presidential inauguration. Her reading of “The Hill We Climb” at the Capitol immediately became a sensation. An illustrated book of her poem quickly zoomed to the top of bestseller lists. Shortly after the inauguration, she signed with IMG Models, an agency that represents supermodels, tennis star Naomi Osaka and playwright Jeremy O. Harris. This week, she covers Time Magazine, in an interview conducted by Michelle Obama.

Gorman’s Super Bowl appearance had been planned before the inauguration. She seemed to grasp the unlikeliness of her pre-game reading, the first in Super Bowl history. And with potentially 100 million viewers on the CBS telecast, it made for one very well-attended poetry recital.

“Poetry at the Super Bowl is a feat for art and our country, because it means we’re thinking imaginatively about human connection even when we feel siloed,” Gorman said Sunday on Twitter. “I’ll honor three heroes who exemplify the best of this effort. Here’s to them, to poetry and to a Super Bowl like no other.”

It marks the seventh Super Bowl win of Brady’s illustrious career, and first as a member of the Buccaneers. The 43-year-old quarterback was also named Super Bowl MVP for the fifth time in his career, a league record .

Tom Brady finished off a dream season Sunday night, leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 31-9 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV.

Tampa Bay used a nice blend of run and pass to decimate Kansas City. The quarterback finished 21-for-29 for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He was supported by Leonard Fournette (16 carries, 89 yards, one touchdown) and Rob Gronkowski (six catches, 67 yards, two touchdowns).

“I’m so proud of all these guys,” Brady said. “We had a rough November but we came together at the right time. We knew this was gonna happen. We played our best game of the year.”

On the other side of the ball, Patrick Mahomes was 26-for-49 for 270 yards and two interceptions.

The Chiefs were hobbled by a series of ill-timed penalties at key moments in the first half — Kansas City was flagged for 10 penalties for 110 yards on the night, and the self-inflicted wounds would come back to haunt the Chiefs.

Compounding Kansas City’s issues was the fact that the Chiefs were without both starting tackles, which allowed Tampa Bay to generate a consistent pass rush that had Mahomes on the run much of the evening.

The Bucs spotted Kansas City a 3-0 lead, but a touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski shortly before the end of the first quarter gave Tampa Bay a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. Two second-quarter touchdowns passes to a pair of ex-Patriots — Gronkowski and Antonio Brown — made it 21-6 at halftime.

The Chiefs cut the lead to 12 early in the third quarter on Harrison Butker’s third field goal of the night, but the Buccaneers git cranked up again when Fournette punched it in from 27 yards out, and Ryan Succop added a 52-yard field goal to make it 31-9 at the end of the third.

A fourth-quarter drive from Mahomes and the Kansas City offense ended with a red-zone pick with less than two minutes to go to close things out.

Bruce Arians became the oldest coach at age 68 to win the Super Bowl. His mom, 95-year-old Kay Arians, witnessed it in person. Brady, Gronk and defensive coordinator Todd Bowles helped Arians get that Vince Lombardi Trophy.

“This really belongs to the coaching staff and our players. I didn’t do a damn thing,” Arians said after he was handed the trophy.

Here’s how the game unfolded:

Mahomes picked again — 10:11 p.m.

That should do it.

Brady’s new mark — 10:05 p.m.

Also, this is going to mark the first time Brady will have won four playoff games in one year.

Looks like ‘03-’04 Pats are safe — 9:48 p.m.

Chiefs turn it over on downs — 9:30 p.m.

Three thoughts as the ball goes back to the Buccaneers with 13:32 left in the game.

•Mahomes is killing himself by running backwards as much as he is on these scramble plays.

Advertisement

•Mahomes hasn’t completed a pass on third down.

•I’m not entirely sure why the Chiefs haven’t tried to move heaven and earth to get Tyreek Hill in space. Line him up in the slot. Put him in the backfield. The guy has world-class speed. You have to find a way to get him the football.

End of the third -- 9:23 p.m.

It’s 31-9 at the end of the third quarter. The Chiefs are driving here — and they seem to have found Tyreek Hill — but is it too little, too late?

Tampa keeps scoring — 9:17 p.m.

The Bucs are just running downhill at this point. Taking over with great field position after that interception of Mahomes, the Tampa Bay running game battered the Kansas City defense, getting into the red zone after some bruising runs on the part of Fournette. The series ended with a 52-yard field goal from Succop was good. It’s 31-9 with 2:46 to go in the third quarter. There’s still a lot of football left to be played, but this could very well be the first time the Chiefs have been blown out in a meaningful game in the last couple of years.

Mahomes picked off — 9:07 p.m.

A slow-developing play ends with Mahomes’ first pick of the night. Brady and the Tampa Bay offense have been given great field position again -- the KC 45-yard line -- and a big lead. Can the Bucs’ punch it in again?

Bucs are rolling — 9:01 p.m.

The Chiefs’ defense needed a stop, a turnover … something to swing the momentum back in their direction. It didn’t get it. Brady and the Bucs responded in impressive fashion with a drive that included a 25-yard pass play to Gronkowski that looked straight out of 2011. It was capped with a 27-yard burst around right end from Leonard Fournette that made it 28-9 with 7:45 to go in the third quarter. Fournette now has 10 carries for 64 yards and a touchdown, while Brady is 19-for-23 for 180 yards and three touchdowns. There’s a lot of football left to play, but if we’re looking for early MVP favorites, it’s Brady vs. the rest of the field.

Chiefs answer with field goal — 8:53 p.m.

It’s 21-9 after that field goal, the end of a nice drive that ended up cutting the Tampa Bay lead to 12. The Chiefs opened the second half with their biggest offensive play of the night, a 26-yard run from Edwards-Helaire. That was followed by a nine-yard connection to Kelce, and a 10-yard pickup by Edwards-Helaire off a nice jump cut. The Chiefs were stopped just after that, but a 52-yarder from Butker was good. You’re not going to win with field goals, but at this point, it’s better than nothing. There’s 11:26 to go in the third quarter.

Good stat — 8:43 p.m.

Halftime takeaways — 8:18 p.m.

The Buccaneers lead 21-6 after two quarters in Super Bowl LV.

Tom Brady: 16-for-20, 140 yards, 3 TDs

Ronald Jones: 6 carries, 33 yards

Rob Gronkowski: 5 catches, 42 yards, 2 TDs

Patrick Mahomes: 9-19, 67 yards, 5 carries, 33 yards

Travis Kelce: 5 catches, 47 yards

A few quick takeaways:

•The Chiefs committed eight penalties for 95 yards in the first half, including two that really killed their defense on the second Tampa Bay scoring drive and an ugly defensive pass inference call that set up the Bucs for an Antonio Brown touchdown at the end of the first half. Sloppy, foolish football from a team that is known for playing better. Can’t play like that and expect to win a Super Bowl.

•One of the biggest plays of the first half was when the Chiefs stopped the Bucs, sitting on fourth-and-short on the goal line. Tampa Bay ran behind Vea, who lined up at fullback, and still couldn’t get it. Astounding. (Was I the only one who was wondering why we didn’t see a quarterback sneak from Brady on that play? Who’s making that call, Pete Carroll?) The Chiefs couldn’t take advantage, but if this thing ends up as a one- or two-point differential, that one will loom especially large.

•Through the first quarter-plus, the Chiefs were having issues finding consistency in the passing game. Not sure how much of that has to do with them trying to lean on what they might perceive as their strength — the run game — or how much is a lack of confidence or other issues with their backup tackles in the game. Or maybe the Bucs are throwing a wrinkle into their pass defense that Kansas City hasn’t seen quite yet? Either way, they appeared to find their collective groove toward the end of the first half (Mahomes completed his first six passes of their last drive of the second quarter, four of them to Kelce.) The Chiefs will need more of that in the second half.

•Special teams has been a mixed bag for both teams. Some punting issues, especially with Kansas City, who saw Tommy Townsend drop a punt (he recovered), and after a penalty, punt one away that was significant shorter. The Chiefs also had a nice return, and Butker added 49- and 34-yard field goals. Feels like this one has the potential to turn on another special teams play before it’s all done.

•The Chiefs will get the ball to start the second half. Kansas City’s margin for error is growing slim.

Bucs make it 21-6 — 8:14 p.m.

Ugly defensive sequence that looked an awful lot like what happened with the Packers in the NFC title game. It led to a touchdown with six seconds left in the half -- it’s 21-6 with six seconds left im the second quarter.

Chiefs cut lead to 14-6 — 8:05 p.m.

The 34-yard field goal from Butker is good, which makes it 14-6. That drive had a sense of real urgency for the Chiefs, one Kansas City really needed. Mahomes was able to get things going with his legs, finding some room to run to really get things going. But that was also the best drive for the Kansas City passing game — Mahomes completed his first six passes of the drive (four to Kelce) on the way to the field goal. It’s 14-6 with 1:01 to go in the first half. Have to hold here to close out the first half if you’re the Chiefs’ defense.

Brady, Gronk leading Bucs — 7:53 p.m.

Tom Brady is 12-for-16, 111 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions.

Rob Gronkowski has four catches for 37 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

Gronk with another touchdown — 7:50 p.m.

The Chiefs couldn’t make anything happen after stopping Tampa Bay on the goal line — in fact, they barely got the ball away after a dicey punt from Tommy Townsend. Gifted with good field position, the Buccaneers continued to live right; they dodged a bullet when a Tom Brady pick was called back after a defensive holding call. They got another gift from the Chiefs when a penalty was called on a field-goal attempt that allowed them to keep the drive alive. Given another chance, Brady found Gronkowski for the second touchdown of the night, a 17-yarder. It’s 14-3 with 6:05 to go in the first half.

Kansas City has been hit with five penalties so far. FIVE. This is not championship football for the Chiefs.

Tampa stopped — 7:33 p.m.

HUGE play there — if this ends up being a close loss for Tampa Bay, we’re all going to point to that play. Fourth-and-goal and they can’t get in. (The drop from Haeg looms large — somewhere, Nate Solder is smiling.) Let’s see if the Chiefs can take advantage.

Tampa Bay leads after one — 7:18 p.m.

Bucs up 7-3 after one quarter. Brady is 6-7 for 50 yards and a touchdown. Leonard Fournette has five carries for 29 yards. Meanwhile, Mahomes is 2-8 for 9 yards, and has 3 carries for 24 yards.

Brady, Bucs answer — 7:13 p.m.

Good sequence there for the Bucs, who had struggled to find offensive consistency out of the gate, but hit the Chiefs with some play-actions and screens to get some quality yardage. In the end, it was Brady who found Gronkowski for the first touchdown of the evening. Tampa Bay leads, 7-3, with 37 seconds left in the first quarter. It’s the first first-quarter touchdown in the Super Bowl for Brady.

Chiefs take lead — 7:03 p.m.

The Chiefs take a 3-0 lead on a 49-yard field goal from Butker with 5:10 to go in the first quarter. Said at the start the Kansas City special teams is betting than its Tampa Bay counterparts, and we saw a glimpse of that when a 33-yard punt set the Chiefs up nicely to start that drive. (Not a great punt — or great punt coverage — which meant the Chiefs started at their own 38-yard line.) Kansas City got some quality yardage in the early stages of that drive, including an 11-yard pickup for Mahomes, to get things cranked up. (The 11-yarder is the Chiefs’ longest of the day to this point.) Kansas City stalled a bit and had to settle for the field goal, but it was a good — not great — series for the Chiefs.

KC gives the ball back — 6:48 p.m.

Mahomes picked up he initial third down, but the Chiefs’ stalled out at roughly midfield. It’s scoreless with 11:21 to go in the first quarter. Tom Brady and Tampa Bay will take over at its own 20-yard line. Both offenses feeling each other out in the early going.

Bucs punt early — 6:41 p.m.

Not an ideal start for the Bucs with that three-and-out. As we said earlier, Tampa Bay can’t afford a slow start. In the NFC title game, the Bucs did well to string those third down conversions together in the early going.

Chiefs win toss — 6:35 p.m.

Kansas City wins the toss and defers. Time for some football.

Kickoff looming — 6:20 p.m.

Interesting stat — 6:10 p.m.

Official Price Prediction — 6:00 p.m.

It goes against every fiber of my being -- after covering Brady for 20 years, I picked against him and the Bucs in the divisional round and NFC title game -- but I’m going with Kansas City. Even with some questions along the line, that Chiefs’ offense is just too good. If Brady has issues out of the gate — just a combined three first-quarter points in the nine previous Super Bowl trips — Kansas City has the potential to turn this into a blowout. If the Bucs can slow-play things and run a ball control offense effectively, Tampa Bay has a real chance. But if the Bucs can’t string together successful third-down chances early, they’ll be in trouble. (As a special-teams apologist, I’m also contractually obligated to tell you I like the Kansas City special teams’ more than Tampa.) In the end, I’m going with the Chiefs, 31-23, and Mahomes as the MVP.

Brady warming up — 5:46 p.m.

No weather worries — 5:45 p.m.

Lots of talk this week about the potential for precipitation, but according to our pals at weather.com, it shouldn’t be an issue. Temps are expected to be in the low 60s, with a light wind. Good conditions for football this evening in Florida. In my experience, sloppy weather would have given an edge to the underdog Bucs, but a non-weather game likely favors the Chiefs.

2003-04 Pats still gold standard — 5:15 p.m.

While Kansas City has a shot at following in the footsteps of the 2003-04 Patriots, regardless of what happens against Tampa Bay, one area where it won’t quite measure up is total wins. The ’03-’04 Patriots went 34-4, the best win total in NFL history over a two-year span. If the Chiefs beat the Bucs, they would be 32-6 overall since the start of the 2019 season.

At the same time, a 30-plus win season over two years would still put Kansas City in some exclusive company — here’s a look at some of the more notable teams that hit the mark.

Pats represented in Tampa — 4:50 p.m.

Ground and pound for Brady, Bucs? — 4:43 p.m.

One of the biggest things to take into account today is the fact that in his previous nine Super Bowls, for all his greatness, Tom Brady’s offenses have scored a combined three points. I don’t think Brady and the Bucs can afford a similarly slow start this afternoon against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs; if it’s 14-0 Kansas City after one quarter, it could very well end up being a blowout.

One way to potentially avoid that sort of situation? I wouldn’t be shocked to see Tampa Bay try and operate like the Patriots did in the AFC title game a few years ago — angle for a series of slow and steady drives, grinding out yardage and imposing their will on the KC defense. Really, in my experience, a ball control offense is quite possibly the best way to beat the Chiefs. Keeping Mahomes off the field is the best way to beat Kansas City. Run the ball, use a short and intermediate passing game, and use every second of that play clock.

Super Bowl parties could spur new cases, while more transmissible variants of COVID-19, particularly a highly contagious strain first identified in Britain , could result in spikes this spring.

Also as the workweek begins, the state will ease capacity restrictions on businesses such as restaurants and stores, with the goal of resuming some sense of normalcy amid a downturn in coronavirus cases nearly a year into the pandemic.

As Massachusetts continues its battle against COVID-19, a new mass vaccination facility in Lowell is expected to open Monday and the state’s new call center will start its first full week helping eligible people navigate a serpentine sign-up process for getting appointments statewide.

“We are definitely at risk,” said Dr. Robert Horsburgh, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University. “We have way too many cases and deaths happening each week to be comfortable that we’ve got it on the run.”

The new vaccination center, overseen by Lowell General Hospital and the Circle Health system, will start Monday administering about 400 doses a day at the Cross River Center in the city, said Amy Hoey, the chief operating officer of Lowell General Hospital.

The goal will be to administer 1,000 daily doses at the center when it has an adequate supply of vaccines, she said. The facility is designed with the capacity to administer more than 5,000 doses a day and officials hope to eventually be able to do that many.

“It’s a national, state, and regional goal to get as many people vaccinated as possible,” Hoey said.

Meanwhile, the state call center will have more than 500 workers available to help potentially thousands of eligible residents book appointments for vaccinations. On Friday, on the call center’s first day, it received about 7,100 calls and scheduled about 1,200 appointments, according to the state’s COVID-19 Respond Command Center.

The state will loosen capacity restrictions on businesses such as restaurants, gyms, and stores, raising them from 25 percent on Monday to 40 percent.

The move is supported by Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, who urged officials to focus on messaging that can help direct the state safely out of the pandemic and back to normal life.

“We’ve got to tell [people], if we mask up, they do the testing, they get vaccinated, we protect those who are vulnerable, we can take measured steps to getting back to our lives,” Hurst said. “We have got to give those who have been hurt some measure of hope as we move forward.”

On Sunday, the state’s Department of Public Health reported 3,004 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, along with 76 new deaths. Those latest figures bring the total number of infections in Massachusetts to 516,530. The death toll rose to 14,698.

The pandemic continued to take its toll over the weekend.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst announced Sunday it would pause athletics for at least 14 days after the campus’s risk level for the virus was raised from “elevated” to “high,” the school’s athletic department said on Twitter.

And Deborah B. Goldberg, the state treasurer, announced in a statement that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Goldberg is monitoring her symptoms, following public health guidelines, and is quarantining at home, according to the statement.

In Lowell, hospital officials are working with primary care providers affiliated with Circle Health, as well as through local organizations, to contact eligible people about scheduling vaccinations, according to Hoey. She said they plan to launch a website to allow any eligible Massachusetts resident to sign up for a vaccination shot.

The state call center, which Governor Charlie Baker announced Friday, can be reached by calling 211 and is scheduled to be open Mondays through Fridays 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Translators will be available in about 100 languages, according to Baker.

Criticism over the difficulty of using the state’s website, which connects people to separate registration systems for vaccination appointments, poured in before Baker implemented the call center.

But problems persist with the state’s online sign-up.

On Saturday in Framingham, dozens of seniors were mistakenly allowed to sign up to receive shots at a local school intended to serve as a vaccination site for city residents only.

In Springfield, where the Eastfield Mall opened as a state mass vaccination site Jan. 29, many people who signed up for their first of two shots were not able to schedule second doses, said state Senator Eric Lesser, a Longmeadow Democrat.

“Something that I am hearing from every community is that it is very confusing and unclear how you actually access the vaccine if you are eligible,” Lesser said.

When he announced last week that the state would roll back some capacity restrictions, Baker cited the state’s progress against the coronavirus in Massachusetts. As of Friday, the state’s seven-day average of new cases had fallen from a record high of more than 6,200 cases Jan. 8 to almost 2,300 reported Feb. 5.

But Horsburgh expressed frustration with the state’s progress on tamping down new infections, noting that current statistics remain deeply troubling, particularly the daily numbers of new deaths.

The rolling seven-day average of new deaths has been declining from a recent high of 74 deaths reported Jan. 10, according to the state. But that figure has remained above an average of 50 daily deaths for much of that time.

“I do think Massachusetts has not done enough to restrict the spread of the virus, compared to other states,” Horsburgh said. “There is too much ability for people to go out and congregate.... It doesn’t make sense to be allowing people to go out and do things that put them at risk for spreading the virus.”

Bob Luz, president of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, said restaurants have closely hewed to public health rules, including strict measures for social distancing and protective equipment for servers and other workers.

The eased restrictions will help them stay in business and retain their workforce, he said.

“Restaurants do what they are told to do; they follow those protocols,” Luz said. “They take them seriously because they don’t want to ever be closed again.”

Dr. David Hamer, a physician at Boston Medical Center and a Boston University epidemiologist, said the state should be moving more slowly, particularly with the concerns about spikes resulting from Super Bowl parties.

“I would have preferred that the state waited at least two weeks, and see what happened after the Super Bowl weekend,” Hamer said.

There are about 1.1 million residents in the state eligible to get COVID-19 vaccine, including about 450,000 people age 75 and older, health workers, and first responders, according to the state.

As of Sunday night, the state’s COVID-19 Response Command Center reported about 833,000 vaccine doses in Massachusetts have been administered to people, out of more than 1.24 million vaccine total doses delivered to the state.

Hamer said the state’s vaccine rollout has been inconsistent; if he were to assign the state a grade, it would be a B-minus.

“Massachusetts has so much biotech and health care capacity, you’d think we could deliver vaccines effectively,” Hamer said.

Traffic specialists have theorized that, with the roads emptier, more motorists were driving faster, increasing the risk of fatalities. Indeed, the number of tickets for high-speed driving was also on the rise.

There were 334 deaths on Massachusetts roads in 2020, according to a state database. Although that is slightly fewer than 2019's total of 337, it came despite significant reductions in roadway traffic and overall crashes. And while the number of pedestrians killed in crashes is down, the number of motorcyclists and bicyclists who died increased.

The coronavirus made Massachusetts roads noticeably more empty during 2020, but did little to stem another public health issue: the number of people killed by car crashes.

The crash and fatality numbers are preliminary and subject to revision. But they reflect a trend that played out across the country last year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that, after three straight years of declines, fatal crashes were up by more than 4 percent in the first nine months of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. After adjusting for the fewer overall miles driven, the fatality rate actually increased 23 percent in 2020.

“To be honest, I was surprised when deaths went up so significantly,” said Cathy Chase, of the Washington, D.C., organization Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. She called on states and the federal government to adopt new laws for the roads and regulations for cars to improve safety.

“If it took a pandemic and the emptying of roads to advance these measures, then it’s given light to much-belated solutions to problems that have been on the roads for a long time,” Chase said.

In Massachusetts, the roadway fatalities included 185 drivers and 33 passengers. The crashes also killed 51 motorcycle operators, an increase from 2019, as well as 10 cyclists. The 50 pedestrian fatalities, meanwhile, represented a significant decrease from 76 in 2019, according to the database.

The problem was most apparent in the early days of the pandemic, when severe lockdown measures practically emptied highways and roads. Yet in April, there were four more deadly crashes than in the year before, according to the state’s numbers. State officials at the time sounded an alarm and began pushing for increased enforcement while implementing a new messaging campaign on electronic highway signs to urge safe driving.

“We were noticing that we were having a sharp influx of fatalities when we had less than 50 percent of the volume,” said Neil Boudreau, a highway official for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. “That was shocking, but also trending along with the fact that perhaps people were driving faster than they had been.”

Indeed, increased speeds, made more possible by lower traffic volumes, have been widely cited by officials and experts as a likely cause of the higher crash rates. With fewer cars on the road, people may have seen wide-open space ahead and sped up, resulting in more-violent crashes.

Traffic rebounded in the summer but still trailed pre-pandemic levels, while the fatality count nearly mirrored the 2019 total.

“Even a slight increase in speed can literally mean the difference between life and death, or minor and serious injuries,” said AAA Northeast spokeswoman Mary Maguire.

Moreover, the number of violations involving speeds over 100 miles per hour increased by about 40 percent last year, according to state numbers. While that may partially reflect increased enforcement amid the safety concerns, the numbers also reflect a higher percentage of all citations, compared to 2019.

David Procopio, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police, said it is the department’s “educated speculation” that lower congestion yielded higher speeds and more deadly conditions. But he stressed that is unproven.

In Greater Boston, a higher portion of fatal crashes occurred during the morning and afternoon periods, compared to 2019 — which would typically align with rush hour, when traffic is heaviest and slowest.

However, many crashes occurred at times and on days not normally associated with heavy traffic volumes. And Boudreau cautioned that fatalities, while tragic, are small enough in number to see significant fluctuations from year to year. They can also be difficult to compare from one year to the next because of changing variables of crashes, such as causes and locations. He added that the fatality rate improved in the latter part of 2020 as driving increased.

There would be troubling implications for transportation policy if lower traffic levels — a longtime goal of frustrated commuters and policy makers alike — were to bring a lasting fatal downside.

Boudreau said that highlights the importance of designing roads that will lower speeds and reduce swerving from lane to lane. He suggested possibly using rumble strips on more roads and narrowing lanes in certain areas.

Traffic volume, however, may not be the only factor. Drivers may have also been behaving differently because of the pandemic.

Federal research issued in 2020 suggested the pandemic may have led to higher death rates from drunken driving or not wearing seat belts. Massachusetts data do not reflect that, though the numbers are subject to change. And the increase in fatalities could point to people driving more riskily during the pandemic, some advocates say.

“There are so many rules that people are expected to follow about wearing a mask or being risk-averse,” said Emily Stein, president of the Safe Roads Alliance. “I think people saw their cars as this COVID risk-free zone . . . and decided that following the rules of the road were not what they were going to do.”

Or, to be more exact, the failure to get the vaccine to the Black and brown communities in Boston that have been affected most dramatically by the coronavirus.

What began as worry quickly turned into alarm, then anger over the state’s botched rollout of the COVID vaccines.

“The attorney general had a call on Friday [with activists] and the level of anger was palpable,” said Horace Small of the Union of Minority Neighborhoods. “If she could do something, she would. But this is all on [Governor] Charlie Baker and [Health and Human Services Secretary] Marylou Sudders. This is about saving people’s lives.”

The Baker administration has already tacitly admitted that the initial rollout plan hasn’t worked. Locating distribution at the Reggie Lewis Center, in the heart of Roxbury, was a good idea. Failing to ensure that residents of the neighborhood and those surrounding it could get vaccinated there was a major bust. On Friday, the governor, in the face of mounting criticism, vowed that the state would do better, and announced modifications to the system, including a media campaign to combat hesitancy and a call center to help people sign up.

But many people are still skeptical that simply opening up more slots for vaccinations will fix the problem. If the state is serious about doing this right, more of the vaccine should be available in many more locations, including community centers, churches, and perhaps public housing. In addition, there should be a plan to help seniors — the main group currently eligible for the vaccine — to get to the locations giving it out.

Advertisement

In short, this calls for a coordinated grass-roots campaign.

Weeks ago, Baker was talking about the need to ensure that the vaccine would be widely available in the communities that were being hardest hit by the disease. But that hasn’t translated into sufficient access.

While many have expressed concerns that Black and Latino residents might be hesitant to take the vaccine, people I spoke to insisted that 11 months of living through this plague has left people eager for anything that will begin to put it behind them.

“All of the older Black people I talk to are waiting for this vaccine,” said Rev. Jeffrey Brown of Twelfth Baptist Church. “They’ve been in their homes for a year; they’ve been deathly afraid of getting the virus because they’ve heard of or known people who’ve passed away, and they want it.”

Brown cites his own 84-year-old mother — who recently moved to Massachusetts from Pennsylvania — as a case in point. She wanted to get the vaccine as soon as possible, and got her first dose, at the Reggie Lewis, last week.

Brown was on a call with other activists Saturday, brainstorming ways to reach the community more effectively. At this point, people want to take expanded vaccination into their own hands. About two dozen people discussed other places where vaccines should be offered and how to mobilize to get people to those sites, perhaps through working with companies like Uber or Lyft.

“I understand how Fenway Park and Gillette Stadium can be attractive to some communities, but in my community churches are attractive places, community centers are attractive,” Brown said.

“They should think about the places where seniors will feel comfortable and feel they’re being properly taken care of within their community.”

The feeling that community leaders have a better sense than state bureaucrats of how to reach the people they serve isn’t limited to Boston. In Chelsea, the grass-roots organization La Colaborativa, led by Gladys Vega, has already begun working to offer vaccines to residents.

Small points to that Chelsea effort as a model. It’s filling a void, he said, that state government must help to address.

“A lot of this could be handled if we just had the opportunity to sit down with the governor and explain what we can do.”

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the lead prosecutor, said in an interview. “We think that every American should be aware of what happened — that the reason he was impeached by the House and the reason he should be convicted and disqualified from holding future federal office is to make sure that such an attack on our democracy and Constitution never happens again.”

In making Trump the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, Democrats have essentially given themselves an unprecedented do-over. When Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., was preparing to prosecute Trump the first time for a pressure campaign on Ukraine, he read the 605-page record of President Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial cover to cover, sending aides as many as 20 dispatches a day as he sought to modernize a proceeding that had happened only twice before.

This time, a new group of nine Democratic managers need reach back only a year to study the lessons of Schiff’s prosecution: Don’t antagonize Republicans, use lots and lots of video and, above all, make succinct arguments to avoid lulling the jury of lawmakers into boredom or distraction.

Trump’s lawyers have indicated that they once again intend to mount a largely technical defense, contending that the Senate “lacks jurisdiction” to judge a former president after he has left office because the Constitution does not explicitly say it can. Though many legal scholars and a majority of the Senate disagree, Republicans have flocked to the argument in droves as a justification for dismissing the case without weighing in on Trump’s conduct.

But the lawyers, Bruce L. Castor Jr. and David Schoen, also plan to deny that Trump incited the violence or intended to interfere with Congress formalizing Biden’s victory, asserting that his baseless claims that the election was “stolen” are protected by the First Amendment. And Castor told Fox News that he, too, would rely on video, possibly of unrest in American cities led by Democrats.

The managers will try to rebut them as much with constitutional arguments as an overwhelming compendium of evidence. Raskin’s team has spent dozens of hours culling a deep trove of videos captured by the mob, Trump’s own unvarnished words and criminal pleas from rioters who said they acted at the former president’s behest.

The primary source material may replace live testimony. Trying to call new witnesses has been the subject of an extended debate by the managers, whose evidentiary record has several holes that White House or military officials could conceivably fill. At the last trial, Democrats made an unsuccessful push for witnesses a centerpiece of their case, but this time, many in the party say they are unnecessary to prove the charge and would simply cost Biden precious time to move his agenda without changing the outcome.

“It’s not that there should not be witnesses; it’s just the practical realities of where we are with a former president,” said Daniel S. Goldman, a former House lawyer who worked on Trump’s first impeachment. “This is also something that we learned from the last trial: This is a political animal, and these witnesses are not going to move the needle.”

Raskin and other managers declined to speak about strategy, but current and former officials familiar with the confidential preparations agreed to discuss them anonymously. The prosecutors’ almost complete silence in the runup to the trial has been another departure from the strategy of Trump’s first impeachment, when Democrats set up a sizable communications war room in the Capitol and saturated cable television airwaves in an all-out battle against Trump in the court of public opinion.

They have largely left it to trusted allies like Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to publicly discuss their case and bat back criticism about why the House is pressing its case even now that Trump is out of office.

“If we were not to follow up with this, we might as well remove any penalty from the Constitution of impeachment — just take it out,” Pelosi told reporters who questioned why Democrats would consume so much of Congress’ time with a former president.

Key questions about the scope and shape of the trial remain unsettled. Senators spent the weekend haggling over the precise structure and rules of the proceeding, the first time in American history a former president will be put on trial.

Prosecutors and Trump’s defense lawyers expected to have at least 12 hours each to make their case. Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, has been coaching his colleagues in daily meetings to aggressively winnow down their arguments, cling to narrative where possible and integrate them with the visual aids they plan to display on TVs in the Senate chamber and on screens across the country.

Behind the scenes, Democrats are relying on many of the same lawyers and aides who helped assemble the 2020 case, including Susanne Sachsman Grooms from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and Aaron Hiller, Arya Hariharan, Sarah Istel and Amy Rutkin from the Judiciary Committee. The House also temporarily called back Barry H. Berke, a seasoned New York defense lawyer, to serve as chief counsel and Joshua Matz, a constitutional expert.

Schiff said his team had tried to produce an “HBO miniseries” featuring clips of witness testimony to bring to life the esoteric plot about Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine. Raskin’s may appear more like a blockbuster action film.

“The more you document all the tragic events leading up to that day and the president’s misconduct on that day and the president’s reaction while people were being attacked that day, the more and more difficult you make it for any senator to hide behind those false constitutional fig leaves,” said Schiff, who has informally advised the managers.

To assemble the presentation, Raskin’s team has turned to the same outside firm that helped put together Schiff’s multimedia display. But Raskin is working with vastly richer material to tell a monthslong story of how he and his colleagues believe Trump seeded, gathered and provoked a mob to try to overturn his defeat.

There are clips and tweets of Trump from last summer, warning he would only lose if the election was “rigged” against him; clips and tweets of him claiming victory after his loss; and clips and tweets of state officials coming to the White House as he sought to “stop the steal.” There is audio of a call in which Trump pressured Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” the votes needed to reverse Biden’s victory there; as well as presidential tweets and accounts by sympathetic lawmakers who say that once those efforts failed, Trump decisively turned his attention to the Jan. 6 meeting of Congress for one last stand.

At the center is footage of Trump, speaking outside the White House hours before the mob overtook the police and invaded the Capitol building. The managers’ pretrial brief suggests they are planning to juxtapose footage of Trump urging his supporters to “fight like hell” and march to the Capitol and confront Congress with videos posted from members of the crowd who can be heard processing his words in real time.

“Even with this trial, where senators themselves were witnesses, it’s very important to tell the whole story,” Schiff said. “This is not about a single day; it is about a course of conduct by a president to use his office to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power.”

But the proximity could also create complications. Several people familiar with the preparations said the managers were wary of saying anything that might implicate Republican lawmakers who echoed or entertained the president’s baseless claims of election fraud. To have any chance of making an effective case, the managers believe, they must make clear it is Trump who is on trial, not his party.",Impeachment case aims to marshal outrage of Capitol attack against Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is set to announce this week that it will reengage with the much-maligned U.N. Human Rights Council that former President Donald Trump withdrew from almost three years ago, U.S. officials said. The decision reverses another Trump-era move away from multilateral organizations and agreements.

Trump pulled out of the world body's main human rights agency in 2018 due to its disproportionate focus on Israel, which has received by far the largest number of critical council resolutions against any country, as well as the number of authoritarian countries among its members and because it failed to meet an extensive list of reforms demanded by then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.

In addition to the council’s persistent focus on Israel, the Trump administration took issue with the body’s membership, which currently includes China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russia and Venezuela, all of which have been accused of human rights abuses.

One senior U.S. official said the Biden administration believed the council must still reform but that the best way to promote change is to “engage with it in a principled fashion.” The official said it can be “an important forum for those fighting tyranny and injustice around the world” and the U.S. presence intends to ""ensure it can live up to that potential.”

That official and three others familiar with the decision were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the announcement, and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Although the U.S. will have only nonvoting observer status on the council through the end of 2021, the officials said the administration intends to seek one of three full member seats — currently held by Austria, Denmark and Italy — from the “Western Europe and other states group” that come up for election later this year.

The U.N. General Assembly makes the final choice in a vote that generally takes place in October every year to fill vacancies in three-year terms at the 47-member-state council.

U.S. engagement with the council and its predecessor, the U.N. Human Rights Commission, has been something of a political football between Republican and Democratic administrations for decades. While recognizing its shortcomings, Democratic presidents have tended to want a seat at the table while Republicans have recoiled at its criticism of Israel.

Trump's withdrawal from the UNHRC, however, was one of a number of U.S. retrenchments from the international community during his four years in office. He also walked away from the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the World Health Organization, U.N. education and cultural organization, UNESCO, and several arms-control treaties. Trump also threatened to withdraw from the International Postal Union and frequently hinted at pulling out of the World Trade Organization.

Since taking office last month, President Joe Biden has rejoined both the Paris accord and the WHO and has signaled interest in returning to the Iran deal as well as UNESCO.

WASHINGTON — Top House Democrats are preparing to unveil legislation that would send up to $3,600 per child to millions of Americans, as lawmakers aim to change the tax code to target child poverty rates as part of President Joe Biden’s sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

“The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it’s devastating,” said Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, chair of the Ways and Means Committee and one of the champions of the provision. “This money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone’s head or food on their table. This is how the tax code is supposed to work for those who need it most.”

The credits would be split into monthly payments from the IRS beginning in July, based on a person’s or family’s income in 2020. Although the proposed credit is only for a year, some Democrats said they would fight to make it permanent, a sweeping move that could reshape efforts to fight child poverty in America.

The one-year credit appears likely to garner enough support to be included in the stimulus package, but it will also have to clear a series of tough parliamentary hurdles because of the procedural maneuvers Democrats are using to muscle the stimulus package through, potentially without Republican support.

With House Democratic leadership aiming to have the stimulus legislation approved on the chamber floor by the end of the month, Congress moved last week to fast-track Biden’s stimulus plan even as details of the legislation are still being worked out. Buoyed by support from Democrats in both chambers and a lackluster January jobs report, Biden has warned that he plans to move ahead with his plan whether or not Republicans support it.

Republicans, who have accused Biden of abandoning promises of bipartisanship and raised concerns about the nation’s debt, have largely balked at his plan because of its size and scope after Congress approved trillions of dollars in economic relief in 2020.

But the child tax credit could provide an opportunity for some bipartisan support, since Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, introduced a similar measure that would send payments of up to $1,250 per month to families with children. Romney’s proposal, intended to encourage Americans to have more children while reducing child poverty rates, would distribute payments through the Social Security Administration and offset costs by eliminating other government safety net spending.

“If you’re President Biden, and you’re serious about having a bipartisan — working together with people on the other side, bringing people together in unity, he has the opportunity to do it,” Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” (Toomey has said he would not support Biden’s proposal because of the price tag.)

Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, warned Sunday that the United States labor market was stalling and in a “deep hole” that could take years to emerge from if lawmakers did not quickly pass the stimulus package.

Yellen rebutted concerns that big spending would lead to inflation and said the economy would face the kind of long, slow recovery that it experienced after the 2008 financial crisis if lawmakers did too little.

“The most important risk is that we leave workers and communities scarred by the pandemic and the economic toll that it’s taken,” Yellen said on CNN. “We have to make sure this doesn’t take a permanent toll on their lives.”

Yellen said that passing the stimulus package could allow the economy to reach full employment by next year. Failing to do so, she said, could leave the jobless rate elevated for years to come.

The provision expanding the child tax credit is among the legislative proposals intended to address the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic and help families weather the nation’s faltering economy. Researchers at Columbia University found that Biden’s overall stimulus proposal could cut child poverty in half in 2021 because of the expansion of the child credit, as well as other changes to tax credits and expansions of unemployment and food assistance benefits.

“The moment is here to make dramatic cuts in child poverty that could improve the lives and the future of millions of children,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said Sunday. She said she would push to make the credit permanent.","Democrats, including Representative Neal, to unveil up to $3,600 child tax credit as part of stimulus bill"

The latest hearing was postponed last month due to lockdown restrictions on public gatherings.

Netanyahu was indicted last year for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. In recent months, Israelis have held weekly protests calling on him to resign over the charges and criticizing his government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse could be heard inside the room where the hearing was being held.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pleaded not guilty on Monday as his trial on corruption charges resumed in a Jerusalem courtroom just weeks before national elections in which he hopes to extend his 12-year rule.

Israel’s longest serving leader is also the first sitting prime minister to go on trial for corruption. Israeli law requires Cabinet ministers to resign when charged with criminal offenses, but does not specifically address the case of a prime minister under indictment.

Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and has dismissed the charges against him as a “witch-hunt” orchestrated by biased law enforcement and media. He has refused to step down and has used his office as a bully pulpit against critics and the criminal justice system.

At Monday’s hearing, Netanyahu’s lawyers submitted a written response pleading not guilty. They then argued against the cases on procedural grounds, saying the attorney general had not properly approved the investigations in writing.

After around 20 minutes, Netanyahu left the courtroom without explanation and his motorcade departed.

The hearing continued in his absence, with his lawyers arguing for more than an hour that constitutional procedures had not been followed. The judges appeared skeptical and repeatedly called on the defense lawyers to wrap it up. The prosecution then rejected those arguments, saying the attorney general had approved the investigations in dozens of meetings.

At the start of his trial last May, Netanyahu was flanked by a cohort of Likud party allies as he railed against the media, police, judges and prosecutors. He said the trial aimed to “depose a strong, right-wing prime minister, and thus remove the nationalist camp from the leadership of the country for many years.”

Netanyahu has served as Israel’s prime minister since 2009, and in the past two years has managed to hang onto power through three tumultuous, deadlocked elections. His flimsy ruling coalition collapsed in December, and he now faces a major battle for reelection in March 23 parliamentary elections.

Netanyahu hopes to campaign on having pulled the country out of the pandemic through one of the world’s most successful vaccination campaigns. He boasts of having personally secured millions of doses from major drug makers, allowing Israel to vaccinated more than a third of its population of 9.3 million. He hopes to vaccinate the entire adult population by late March.

But his government has faced heavy criticism for other aspects of its response to the crisis. The country is only now starting to emerge from its third nationwide lockdown, and the closures have sent unemployment skyrocketing.

An emergency government formed last May to combat the coronavirus outbreak has been mired in bickering. The country’s leaders have struggled to enact consistent policies and repeatedly accused each other of playing politics with the pandemic. Israel has meanwhile reported nearly 700,000 cases since the outbreak began, including 5,121 deaths.

One major controversy concerns Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, many of whom have openly flouted restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu will need the ultra-Orthodox parties to form a ruling coalition, and his critics accuse him of turning a blind eye to their violations.

Polls show Netanyahu’s Likud winning the most seats but struggling to form a 61-seat majority coalition in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. The margin of victory could be extremely tight, potentially allowing a small, fringe party to decide who heads the next government.

South Africa halted use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford coronavirus vaccine Sunday after evidence emerged that the vaccine did not protect clinical trial volunteers from mild or moderate illness caused by the more contagious virus variant that was first seen there.

Advertisement

The developments, coming nearly a week after 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine arrived in South Africa, were an enormous setback for the country, where more than 46,000 people are known to have died from the virus.

They were also another sign of the dangers posed by new mutations in the coronavirus. The B.1.351 variant has spread to at least 32 countries, including the United States.

The number of cases evaluated as part of the studies outlined by South African scientists Sunday were low, making it difficult to pinpoint just how effective or not the vaccine might be against the variant.

And because the clinical trial participants who were evaluated were relatively young and unlikely to become severely ill, it was impossible for the scientists to determine if the variant interfered with the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine’s ability to protect against severe COVID-19, hospitalizations or deaths.

The scientists said, however, that they believed the vaccine might protect against more severe cases, based on the immune responses detected in blood samples from people who were given it. If further studies show that to be the case, South African health officials will consider resuming use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, they said.

Advertisement

The new research findings have not been published in a scientific journal. But the discovery that the AstraZeneca-Oxford product showed minimal efficacy in preventing mild and moderate cases of the new variant added to the mounting evidence that B.1.351 makes current vaccines less effective.

Pfizer and Moderna have both said that preliminary laboratory studies indicate that their vaccines, while still protective, are less effective against B.1.351. Novavax and Johnson & Johnson have also sequenced test samples from their clinical trial participants in South Africa, where B.1.351 caused the vast majority of cases, and both reported lower efficacy there than in the United States.

“These results are very much a reality check,” Shabir Madhi, a virologist at University of the Witwatersrand who ran the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine trial in South Africa, said of the findings released Sunday.

The pause in the country’s rollout of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine means that the first shipments will now be put in warehouses.

Instead, South African health officials said they would inoculate health workers in the coming weeks with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has shown strong efficacy in preventing severe cases and hospitalizations caused by the new variant.

Johnson & Johnson has applied for an emergency use authorization in South Africa. But health officials there indicated that even before it is authorized, some health workers could be given the vaccine as part of an ongoing trial.

In the AstraZeneca-Oxford trial in South Africa, roughly 2,000 participants were given either two doses of the vaccine or placebo shots.

Advertisement

There was virtually no difference in the numbers of people in the vaccine and placebo groups who were infected with B.1.351, suggesting that the vaccine did little to protect against the new variant. Nineteen of the 748 people in the group that was given the vaccine were infected with the new variant, compared with 20 out of 714 people in the group that was given a placebo.

That equates to a vaccine efficacy of 10%, though the scientists did not have enough statistical confidence to know for sure whether that figure would hold among more people.

Researchers also conducted laboratory experiments on blood samples from people who had been vaccinated and found a significant reduction in the activity levels of vaccine-generated antibodies against the B.1.351 variant compared with other lineages.

Beyond the troubling news about the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, Madhi reported evidence suggesting that past infection by earlier versions of the coronavirus did not protect people in South Africa from the B.1.351 variant.

In order to determine who had previously been infected by the coronavirus, researchers tested blood samples from people who had enrolled in a trial of the Novavax vaccine, but who were given placebo shots and not the vaccine itself.

The researchers compared the levels of infection by the new variant in people who showed evidence of having previously had COVID-19 with the levels of infection in people who did not, and found no difference.

That suggested, Madhi wrote on a slide presented Sunday night, that “past infection by ‘original’ variants of SARS-CoV-2 do NOT protect against mild and moderate COVID-19 from the B.1.351 variant.”

He said it was possible that the potential of the B.1.351 variant to evade immune responses in people who had previously been infected accounted at least in part for why South Africa has suffered such a devastating second wave of the virus in recent months.

Researchers from the University of Oxford acknowledged Sunday that the vaccine provided “minimal protection” against mild or moderate cases involving the B.1.351 variant. They are working to produce a new version of the vaccine that can protect against the most dangerous mutations of the B.1.351 variant, and have said they hope it will be ready by the fall.

“This study confirms that the pandemic coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected,” Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said in a statement. “But, taken with the promising results from other studies in South Africa using a similar viral vector, vaccines may continue to ease the toll on health care systems by preventing severe disease.”

Moderna has also begun developing a new form of its vaccine that could be used as a booster shot against the variant in South Africa.

B.1.351 has become the dominant form of the virus in South Africa and has been found in several dozen countries. A small number of cases have been reported in South Carolina, Maryland and Virginia.

Scientists believe that B.1.351 may be more adept at dodging protective vaccine-generated antibodies because it has acquired a mutation, known as E484K, that makes it harder for antibodies to grab onto the virus and prevent it from entering cells.

Novavax said its vaccine was just under 50% effective in preventing COVID-19 in its South Africa trial. Johnson & Johnson reported that its single-shot vaccine was 57% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 in South Africa, though it still offered complete protection against hospitalization and death after four weeks.

Another fast-spreading variant of the virus, known as B.1.1.7 and first identified in Britain, does not appear to interfere with vaccines. All five of the leading vaccines, and most recently AstraZeneca’s product, have been found offer similar levels of protection against B.1.1.7 compared to earlier lineages of the virus.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine has been authorized by around 50 countries, including Britain, which has found dozens of cases of the variant first seen in South Africa. While many countries scarcely sequence the virus, making it difficult to know whether the B.1.351 variant has taken hold there, it does not appear to be dominant yet in any of the countries outside South Africa that are looking for it.

In the United States, regulators are waiting on data from a large, late-stage clinical trial of the AstraZeneca-Oxford that is expected to report results in March.",AstraZeneca’s vaccine does not work well against virus variant in South Africa

The following day, he said, the Slovenian authorities handed him over to Croatian police at the border, who beat him with batons wrapped with barbed wire as he lay handcuffed before deporting him to neighboring Bosnia.

ROME — To escape persecution in his homeland, a 27-year-old Pakistani man walked over mountains and through woods on an arduous 18-month journey across Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia until he finally reached the Italian border.

“I thought I would be safe once I reached Europe,” said Mahmood, who asked to be identified by his last name only out of concern for his safety. “But I was wrong.”

Mahmood spoke in a phone interview from Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he has been sleeping since August in an abandoned building with temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 Celsius) at night.

He is one of about 1,300 migrants sent back by Italy last year as they arrived at the country’s northeastern border through the so-called Balkan route. Many of them ended up stranded in Bosnia and living in dismantled migrant camps or abandoned buildings, exposed to freezing winter cold.

Left-wing lawmakers in Italy and migrant advocacy groups say these informal returns — summarily sending migrants back without any formal identification procedures or opportunity to apply for asylum — violate Italian, European and international laws. Their position was supported by a court ruling in Rome last month.

In 2020, there was a spike in the number of migrants the Italian government returned in this informal way compared with 2019, according to government data. The tougher stance was motivated in part by trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which hit Italy particularly hard. But it was also in line with a general hardening on the issue of migrants across Europe.

The Italian government has said that a bilateral agreement with Slovenia allows it to return illegal migrants who cross their common border immediately. Both countries are members of the European Union, meaning migrants should benefit from the same asylum rights on either side of their border.

But humanitarian organizations accuse Italy of exploiting the coronavirus crisis to send back migrants and say that sets off a chain of rejections that leaves migrants vulnerable to police abuse in Croatia — which human rights groups say is prevalent.

“Through these pushbacks they are initiating, they are directly contributing to putting people in this precarious position,” said Simon Campbell, a field coordinator with the Border Violence Monitoring Network, a group of associations that monitor human rights violations along the Balkan route.

Campbell accused Croatia, also a member of the EU, of what he called “torturous practices” and said Italy shared a “direct complicity.”

The Croatian government has denied committing abuses.

After the rejections by Italy and Slovenia, the migrants are left vulnerable to eventually being pushed out of the EU to countries like Bosnia, which are not bound by the bloc’s standards on the treatment of migrants.

All of these concerns came up last month when a national court in Rome heard Mahmood’s asylum case, which detailed his journey to reach Italy and the rejections that sent him back to a vulnerable existence in Bosnia.

A judge ruled that Italy’s refusal to allow him entry on the Slovenian border was illegal because the government knew full well that its actions would “expose migrants and asylum-seekers to inhuman and degrading treatment” inducing what she called “chain pushbacks” to Bosnia. In general, the judge ruled that such informal returns of migrants to Slovenia are illegal.

Italian nationalists, who sit in the opposition, have seized on the bump in migrant arrivals over the summer and coronavirus outbreaks in overcrowded shelters to reinvigorate a national debate about migration.

Italy’s government has responded by increasing the military and police presence at the northeastern border around Trieste, urging officers to send more migrants back.

Last year Italy informally returned about 1,300 migrants who arrived from Slovenia under the bilateral agreement compared with about 250 in 2019, according to the Interior Ministry.

“We have to keep the pandemic from spreading,” Luciana Lamorgese, the Italian Interior minister, said at a news conference in Trieste in September as she announced stricter patrols outside migrant shelters in the region and along the border.

Mahmood, who is gay, said that he fled Pakistan because he felt he could not live freely in the country, where homosexuality is a big taboo.

His journey to the Italian border began by crossing from Pakistan into neighboring Iran. From there, traveling on foot or in smugglers' vans, he made his way through Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece and North Macedonia before he reached Bosnia. Then it was on to Croatia, Slovenia and finally Italy.

When he arrived at the border crossing in Trieste, he said local volunteers were treating his leg injuries suffered on the journey when plainclothes Italian officers appeared and took him to a police station. He said he told the police twice that he wanted to seek asylum in the country.

Migrants are supposed to be identified and listed as asylum-seekers in the first European country where they arrive, but often they hope to travel beyond the southern or eastern European countries where many enter the bloc. Nonetheless, authorities are supposed to take up the migrants’ asylum request in any European nation.

Mahmood should have been granted the possibility to file for asylum in Trieste.

The Border Violence Monitoring Network compiled a report on his case, and two Italian lawyers took it to the courts.

Silvia Albano, the Roman judge who decided Mahmood’s case, found that Italy had breached international, European and Italian law and was required to issue Mahmood a visa and allow him to apply for asylum. Mahmood said this past week that he had not yet received his visa.

A representative for the Interior Ministry did not appear in court, and the Italian authorities did not respond to requests for comment on the case. Local media have reported that the Interior Ministry intends to appeal the decision.

The court also found that Italy violated EU regulations that allow asylum-seekers to start their application in any member country that they reach.

Last July, Achille Variati, an undersecretary in the Italian Interior Ministry, cited the 1996 bilateral agreement with Slovenia as the grounds for Italian authorities sending migrants back to Slovenia without any formal procedure, regardless of whether they sought to apply for asylum.

But the Interior minister, Lamorgese, later amended that statement, insisting that authorities always provide migrants the chance to file asylum requests.

Other migrants said they too were not afforded such an opportunity.

Shahid Mehmood, a 23-year-old Pakistani refugee, said he reached Italy this summer after being pushed back several times by the Croatian and Slovenian police. He burst into tears of relief when he crossed the border into Italy, he said. But his joy was also short-lived.

Italian officers put him on a bus to a Slovenian police station, he said.

CHICAGO — Joe Biden, the first sitting US president to openly oppose the death penalty, has discussed the possibility of instructing the Department of Justice to stop scheduling new executions, officials have told the Associated Press.

The officials had knowledge of the private discussions with Biden but were not authorized to speak publicly about them.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked Friday about Biden's plans on the death penalty, said she had nothing to preview on the issue.

Action to stop scheduling new executions could take immediate pressure off Biden from opponents of the death penalty. But they want him to go much further, from bulldozing the federal death chamber in Terre Haute, Ind., to striking the death penalty from US statutes entirely.

While the coronavirus pandemic and election coverage dominated the news last year, many Americans who paid close attention to the resumption of federal executions under former president Donald Trump were dismayed by their scale and the apparent haste to carry them out.

The executions, beginning July 14 and ending four days before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, were the first federal executions in 17 years. More were held in the last six months under Trump than in the previous 56 years combined.

Executions went ahead for inmates whose lawyers claimed were too mentally ill or intellectually disabled to fully grasp why they were being put to death.

Lawyers for Lisa Montgomery, convicted of killing a pregnant Missouri woman and cutting out her baby, said her mental illness was partly triggered by years of horrific sexual abuse as a child. On Jan. 13, she became the first woman executed federally in nearly 70 years.

Biden can guarantee no federal executions during his presidency by simply telling the Justice Department never to schedule any. But that would not prevent a future president who supports capital punishment from restarting them.

Barack Obama, for whom Biden served as vice president, did place an informal moratorium on carrying federal executions out when he was president, ordering a review of execution methods in 2014 after a botched state execution in Oklahoma.

But Obama never took any steps toward ending federal executions for good. That left the door open for Trump to resume them. Death penalty critics want Biden to slam shut that door.

The surest way to prevent a future president from again restarting executions is to sign a bill abolishing the federal death penalty. That would require Congress to pass such a bill.

Thirty-seven members of Congress urged Biden in a Jan. 22 letter to support the Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act, sponsored by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois.

But Biden would have to persuade Republicans. In the 22 states that have struck the death penalty from their statutes, none succeeded in passing the required laws without bipartisan support.

Biden could draw immediately on his presidential powers and do what Obama did not: commute the death sentences of 50-some inmates still on death row in Terre Haute to life in prison. None of the death sentences could ever be restored.

Commutations in themselves would not stop prosecutors from seeking death sentences in new cases. That would require an instruction to Biden’s Justice Department to never authorize prosecutors to seek them.

Death Penalty Action has called on Biden to order the razing of the Terre Haute death-chamber building. Demolishing the bleak, windowless facility, argued Abe Bonowitz, director of the Ohio-based group, would symbolize Biden’s commitment to stopping federal executions for good.

The breakneck pace and the government’s relentless push in the courts to get them done did galvanize opponents — and also attracted new adherents to their cause, said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Information Center.

“Trump demonstrated more graphically than at any other time what the abuse of capital punishment would look like,” he said. “It has created a political opportunity, which is why death penalty opponents want the president to strike while the iron is hot.”

Death Penalty Action, which organized protests outside the US penitentiary in Terre Haute during the executions, saw numbers of those donating, signing petitions or requesting information soar from 20,000 to 600,000 over the past six months.

Bonowitz said interest spiked after reality TV star Kim Kardashian pleaded on Twitter for Trump to commute Brandon Bernard's death sentence to life. Bernard was executed anyway on Dec. 10.

Biden could get pushback not only from death penalty proponents in the Republican Party but also from some members of his own party who will see bids to abolish capital punishment as a losing issue politically.

Clearing death row would also mean sparing the lives of killers such as Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who in 2015 shot dead nine Black members of a South Carolina church during a Bible study. Biden would be placed in the uncomfortable position of having to explain to victims' families why Roof and others killers should not die.

While support for the death penalty overall has plummeted to just over 50 percent in recent years, many Americans may not want to preclude the possibility of a death sentence in terrorism cases such as the Boston Marathon bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted in that attack, which killed three people and injured hundreds.

The Supreme Court is currently considering an appeal from the Trump administration that sought to reverse a ruling by a lower court tossing Tsarnaev’s death sentence. The Biden administration may have to decide soon whether to continue that appeal or tell the high court the government now accepts the lower court's decision.",Big challenge: Biden is pressed to end federal death penalty

I’m talking to Bernie Sanders. I’m talking to AOC.’”

But Schumer was eager to offer reassurance. At one point, he described himself as a former tenant organizer who was now in a position to deliver on housing issues on a grand scale, several participants recalled.

On a recent Sunday evening, about a dozen liberal housing activists from New York gathered for a virtual meeting with Senator Chuck Schumer. Although the newly anointed majority leader had served in Congress for four decades, a number of participants had scarcely interacted with him before, and some regarded him as an uncertain ally.

The January meeting was one in a series of steps Schumer has taken to win over leaders of the left in New York and Washington before his campaign for reelection in 2022. Armed with a sweeping set of policy promises, he is courting the activists, organizers, and next-generation elected officials in New York who would be likely to make up the backbone of an effort to dethrone him, should one ever arise.

He is facing an extraordinary balancing act in the coming days as he seeks simultaneously to forge a massive relief bill to counter the coronavirus pandemic and to manage the impeachment of the former president, Donald Trump. Both tasks are seen as urgent practical and moral imperatives by the Democratic Party’s electoral base.

Schumer, 70, has been attempting to channel his party’s sense of impatient purpose: In recent days, he has publicly urged President Biden to “go big and bold” with his economic policies and executive actions, defying pressure from Republicans and a few centrist Democrats to pare back campaign promises.

Over the last week, Schumer has backed a new push to decriminalize cannabis; signed on to Senator Cory Booker’s Baby Bonds proposal, a plan to address the racial wealth gap; and appeared with Senator Elizabeth Warren and other progressives to call on Biden to cancel student debt.

On impeachment, too, Schumer has taken an into-the-breach approach, demanding Trump’s removal from office the morning after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and casting the upcoming trial as a crucial ritual of accountability, even if it is highly improbable that two-thirds of the Senate will vote for conviction.

Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, said Schumer was emphatic in private conversations that he intends to “get really big things done,” despite the daunting Senate math. Mitchell said he spoke frequently with Schumer but had not yet discussed the 2022 campaign with him.

“He’s going to have to use all the tools at his disposal to keep his caucus together. He gets that. We all get that. It’s not a surprise,” Mitchell said. “I think he’s also really clear that the alternative is unacceptable — that he absolutely has to deliver.”

The new Senate leader appears to recognize that his political playbook requires updating. A compulsive retail politician and prodigious fund-raiser, Schumer climbed to power less as a legislative engineer and an author of big ideas than as a campaign tactician with a financial base on Wall Street and a keen eye for finding the political midpoint between liberal New York City and its historically conservative suburbs.

David Carlucci, a former state senator from Rockland County who lost a House primary in 2018 to a more progressive candidate, Representative Mondaire Jones, said a diverse new generation was transforming state politics. Schumer appears relatively secure, he said, but no Democrat should feel immune.

“Any politician that’s part of the old guard has to be very concerned about a potential primary,” Carlucci said.

In a statement, Schumer said he was trying to “do the best job for my constituents and for my country” and acknowledged a shift in the scope of his governing goals.

“The world has changed, and the needs of families have changed,” he said. “Income and racial inequality has worsened; the climate crisis has become more urgent; Trump has attacked our democracy — all of these things require big, bold action, and that is what I am fighting to deliver in the Senate.”

At the moment, the most serious potential challengers to Schumer — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chief among them — have not taken steps toward a campaign. Ocasio-Cortez, a 31-year-old Queens lawmaker, has told associates she has not decided whether to run but believes the possibility of a challenge serves as a constructive form of pressure on Schumer, people who have spoken with her said.

Other potential opponents appear more focused on assembling a bid to unseat Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Yet Schumer seems to want to deter even a quixotic opponent who could become a nettlesome distraction, or worse. He has taken to using Twitter and cable news interviews to demand that Biden take bold executive action on matters like student debt and climate change.

And as he assumes the expanded powers of the Senate majority, Schumer is drawing on old and new alliances to help him govern.

Starting last spring, Schumer convened several conference calls to craft pandemic relief plans with some of the big policy minds of the Democratic Party. They included more centrist voices, like former Treasury Department official Antonio Weiss; progressive economic thinkers like Felicia Wong of the Roosevelt Institute and Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University; and liberal think tank leaders Heather Boushey and Michael Linden, who now serve in the Biden administration.

Schumer’s regular meetings with national liberal advocacy groups have intensified in recent weeks, and he has been spending time with a cohort of New York progressives elected over the last year.

Representative Ritchie Torres, 32, a progressive who captured an open House seat in the Bronx last fall, said Schumer was the first official to contact him after Torres won a contentious primary; soon afterward, Schumer visited his district for a meeting about expanding the federal child tax credit.

Torres said he intended to back Schumer in any contested primary. “Without a doubt, he deserves to be reelected,” Torres said.

Should Schumer struggle to turn his splashy endorsements of bold action into law, or come to be seen as balking at certain clashes with Republicans, a serious challenge could well emerge. Schumer faces a dense ideological minefield on matters ranging from economic recovery legislation to abolishing the filibuster and achieving statehood for Washington, D.C.

“The pressure is on now that he is one of the most powerful politicians in the entire country,” said Assemblyman Ron Kim, a progressive legislator. “If he can’t deliver, it’s not just him — it’s the party that will suffer in two years or four years.”

John Washington, a Buffalo housing organizer who participated in the January meeting with Schumer, said he had seen a marked shift in the senator. In the past, he said, Schumer would seek out support for his own priorities and offer “radio silence” on activist goals.

“I think it’s clear to everyone that there is kind of a new age of politics,” he said.

One of the lead defense lawyers for Trump has informed Senate leaders that he is an observant Jew who strictly adheres to the commandment against working on the Sabbath and thus would be unable to participate in any proceeding that stretched past sundown on Friday or met Saturday.

Democrats and Republicans eager to tidily conclude former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial within a week may have a fresh obstacle in front of them: the biblical commandment to keep the Jewish Sabbath.

Advertisement

“I apologize for the inconvenience my request that impeachment proceedings not be conducted during the Jewish Sabbath undoubtedly will cause other people involved in the proceedings,” Schoen said in the letter. “The practices and prohibitions are mandatory for me, however; so, respectfully, I have no choice but to make this request.”

The letter was sent to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader; Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader; and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who as president pro tempore is presiding over the trial.

In a statement Saturday evening, a spokesperson for Schumer said an allowance would be made for Schoen but did not elaborate on how.

“We respect their request and of course will accommodate it,” said the spokesperson, Justin Goodman. “Conversations with the relevant parties about the structure of the trial continue.”

While the leaders have yet to agree on a precise timetable for the trial, which is set to begin Tuesday, people familiar with the process had said they were planning for a proceeding that was very likely to stretch into the night Friday and continue Saturday.

But members of both parties are hoping for a speedy trial. Democrats, knowing there are almost certainly not enough votes to convict Trump, want the process over quickly to avoid any further distractions from President Joe Biden’s agenda, particularly his push to quickly pass a stimulus bill and confirm the remainder of his Cabinet. Republicans, who have been badly divided by the push to impeach Trump and do not relish a detailed discussion of his role in provoking the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, have their own reasons for wanting the trial over with quickly.

It is unclear how Senate leaders will honor Schoen’s request. If they moved to fast-track the trial to ensure it was concluded by sundown Friday, it would make for by far the speediest presidential impeachment trial in history. If they suspended it as Schoen has asked, the proceeding could bleed into a federal holiday Monday and what was supposed to be a holiday week for the Senate, when its members were supposed to get a break to go home to their states. If leaders opted instead to delay it further, that would punt planned action on confirming Biden’s nominees and advancing his pandemic aid bill.

Schoen said in a telephone interview Friday that he had not heard from the leaders about a range of issues related to the trial, including its schedule and how much time each side would receive to present arguments. Schumer, who has been negotiating with McConnell over those matters, is expected to announce the details shortly before the trial begins.

Schoen is part of a second group of lawyers who has stepped in to represent Trump in his second impeachment trial. The first team quit after its lawyers refused to commit to making the former president’s preferred trial strategy — that they defend him by repeating his baseless claims that the election was stolen from him.

Now Schoen joins a list of prominent Jews who have run into issues in Washington over observance of the Sabbath. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the former president’s daughter and son-in-law who are Orthodox Jews, said they had received special permission from a rabbi to attend Trump’s inaugural festivities in 2017. They said they had obtained a similar exemption at least once later in Trump’s presidency to travel on the Sabbath.

During the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton in 1999, a Connecticut senator at the time, Joseph Lieberman, who is an observant Jew, walked 4 miles from his Georgetown apartment to Capitol Hill to sit as a juror. Because Jewish law teaches that one may break the Sabbath if the matter involves “concern for human life,” Lieberman, in consultation with his rabbis, devised his own rule whereby he refrained from campaigning or performing any strictly political activity on the Sabbath but would attend Senate sessions and vote, if necessary.

He did not, however, ride in a car or elevator, in line with a restriction that comes from a prohibition against creating sparks and fires.

Schoen’s request will now have to be factored in with decades-old impeachment trial rules and the schedule, work habits and politics of the Senate. The rules say the Senate should meet Monday through Saturday for impeachment trials and break only on Sunday, the schedule that was followed during both Trump’s last trial and Clinton’s.

Schoen noted in his letter that the Sabbath would end at 6:25 p.m. Saturday and proposed that the trial resume Sunday.

“While I would not, of course, want to in any way interfere with anyone’s religious observance on Sunday, perhaps since the proceedings do not commence each day until the afternoon, Sunday proceedings will not affect anyone else’s religious practice (e.g. church attendance),” he wrote.",Trump lawyer asks to pause impeachment trial if it runs into Sabbath

“I think more than anything else, humor is going to rule the day,” said Tim Vaccarino, executive creative director at MullenLowe in Boston. “Brands are really vying for the opportunity to allow people to escape from everything we’re dealing with, even for just a beat.”

DraftKings: The sports-betting company developed its first Super Bowl ads with its in-house team. The two 15-second spots feature DraftKings on-camera host Jessie Coffield, and are aimed at driving fan engagement with the game. Among other things, DraftKings is running a free-to-play contest in which fans can enter to win cash prizes for those who correctly predict the most fourth-quarter outcomes, from a list of 10 questions. DraftKings is going big with this bet, given that 30 seconds of airtime in the national broadcast sells for $5.5 million.

E*Trade: MullenLowe is behind the other national ad with local roots, an E*Trade spot dubbed “Workout.” It’s a return to the Big Game for both companies. MullenLowe crafted its first Super Bowl ad for the Virginia-based online brokerage in 2018. The new 30-second spot was produced last summer, long before the recent GameStop mania in the stock market. The story line: A young, scrawny kid attempts to get in shape. The message: It’s the right time of year to achieve financial fitness. The soundtrack: “You’re the Best,” the Joe Esposito song made famous by the original “Karate Kid” movie.

Boston Beer: The Samuel Adams brewer and its hapless but likable ambassador known as “Your Cousin from Boston” will commandeer the Clydesdales known for promoting Budweiser. In a 30-second spot, the bungling character accidentally unyokes the horses and unleashes chaos. It airs in New York and Boston markets only, at a $770,000 price tag. Boston Beer’s agency is from San Francisco (Goodby Silverstein & Partners), but the spot was directed by Worcester native Matt Aselton and stars Amesbury native Greg Hoyt. Yes, the accent sounds good because it’s real. Maybe he can team up with Hyundai for a Smaht Pahk ad next year.

Arbella Insurance: Quincy-based insurer Arbella lands a local spot for its first Super Bowl ad. This one is only airing in the Boston market, but it features another bumbler. This time, it’s a guy telling jokes that fall flat at a fancy pre-wedding meal. Don’t combine stand-up comedy with a rehearsal dinner, the narrator says, but do combine home and auto insurance with Arbella. The ad was created by Joe Berkeley LLC, a local agency. Joe Berkeley’s firm was also behind the Shields MRI ads a few years ago that featured Pats-turned-Bucs QB Tom Brady and his Super Bowl rings. Roger that? Sorry, Joe. Not this time.

With businesses owned by people of color, the city spent $53 million, or around 2.5 percent.

The study — aimed at uncovering disparities in the way the city spends its dollars — analyzed 47,801 contracts from 2014 to 2019 and found that businesses owned by white women and people of color were considerably underrepresented, according to a 703-page report obtained by the Globe.

Black- and Latino-owned firms landed just 1.2 percent of the $2.1 billion in contracts for construction and professional goods and services that the City of Boston awarded during the first term of the Walsh administration, according to a new report the city commissioned.

Black-owned businesses were awarded only $9.4 million, or 0.4 percent of total spending, while Latino-owned businesses garnered $18.2 million, or 0.8 percent. Asian-American-owned businesses received $22.7 million, or 1.1 percent of city contract dollars.

The study also analyzed the potential population of firms owned by women and people of color that could have done business with the city and found that hundreds more could have been available for these contracts. Black-owned businesses experienced the starkest gap, with the study finding that Boston could have steered 3.6 percent of its contract and procurement dollars to them.

“We should never use lack of capacity as an excuse as to why we’re not building wealth in communities of color in Boston,” said City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu, who cosponsored a 2017 ordinance requiring the city to collect more data on these contracts. “The numbers clearly back up we are well below where we could be.”

The pending release of the report comes as Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who took office in 2014, is about to leave. He is expected to be confirmed as labor secretary by the Senate and could depart City Hall by the end of February.

It also emerges amid a renewed focus on systemic racism, in light of nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd last year.

The new report confirms in much greater detail, and for over a longer period of time, what previous analyses of city contracts have found. Walsh has previously issued executive orders to create a more equitable contracting process, but the city continues to lag its peers.

In a statement, Walsh spokesman Nicholas Martin said the mayor plans “actionable items” in the coming days to get “to the root of the issues around disparities in city contracting.”

“While the results of this study are not surprising, they reaffirm our belief that more work needs to be done to institutionalize these practices into the everyday business of city government, and reaffirm our commitment to getting the work done,” Martin said.

The new study indicates that Boston spent about $238 million, or 11 percent of its contracting dollars, on firms owned by white women and people of color. That overall figure is higher than previously reported.

Even so, Boston remains well behind other cities on the participation rates of diverse contractors: New York (19 percent), the Chicago area (29 percent), and Philadelphia (31 percent), according to an analysis done in 2019 by a coalition of activist groups, including Lawyers for Civil Rights, Massachusetts Minority Contractors Association, and the Greater Boston Latino Network.

The Boston study recommended a series of improvements including: setting participation goals, unbundling large contracts, expanding advertising and outreach, and increasing the minimum number of quotes for purchase orders. The study also highlighted how the city could hire more staff in its procurement office, create programs to further build capacity of diverse suppliers, and collect comprehensive data on subcontracts.

The city does not have race- or gender-conscious measures to help steer contracts to diverse suppliers because of legal concerns they would not hold up to a court challenge. The disparity study, which Walsh launched in 2018, was seen as a way to provide data and analysis to create new contracting policies that could stand legal challenge.

Segun Idowu, executive director of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, said he is not surprised by the dismal findings. Idowu, however, criticized Walsh for not doing more sooner to make the contracting process welcoming to people of color.

“The unfortunate thing to me is we have been waiting for this disparity study to act,” said Idowu.

Idowu called on Walsh to address the problems before he departs and not leave it to City Council president Kim Janey, who will become acting mayor, to handle. “This happened under his watch,” Idowu added. “I hope we see some action before he heads out to DC.”

Walsh, according to a person briefed on the matter, is drafting an executive order based on recommendations from the study.

Sheldon Lloyd, chief executive of City Fresh Foods in Roxbury, who has city contracts to provide to schools and senior centers, said he could do much more business if big contracts were broken into smaller jobs so a local player like him could compete against a bigger corporation.

Lloyd, who is Black, said refining the procurement process can help Boston businesses of color grow, an effort that ultimately is about “keeping jobs and money in the city.”

“The gap is getting wider, the city of Boston is changing, and communities of color are getting pushed out of the process,” said Lloyd.

The extent of her injury was unclear, but production on the movie, which was filming overnight in Brockton, came to a halt as the Oscar-winning actress was rushed off the set around 1:30 a.m. Friday.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence suffered an injury overnight on the set of the big-budget film “Don’t Look Up” when she was hit by debris propelled from a special effects explosion, according to two sources close to the production.

The incident occurred when a trash can went through a window before Lawrence cleared the immediate area. The actress was apparently hit with fragments, and she was seen holding her face as a medic was called.

Work on the film Friday has been canceled, according to the sources. Reports were circulating among the crew that the actress was OK and film production could resume next week.

A representative for Lawrence did not immediately respond to an e-mail or a phone call.

The Netflix film, by “The Big Short” director Adam McKay, follows two astronomers who learn that an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth but find, frustratingly, no one will take their warnings seriously. Lawrence leads a star-studded cast, along with Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothée Chalamet, Cate Blanchett, Rob Morgan, Meryl Streep, and Jonah Hill.

Filming for “Don’t Look Up” has been taking place in Massachusetts since November. On Wednesday, film crews were spotted in Framingham, and scenes have been filmed in downtown Boston and, in December, at South Station.

The comedy was supposed to begin filming in Boston last spring but was delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Lawrence turned up on the streets of Boston on Nov. 7 for a spirited solo celebration after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election. Lawrence, clad in pajamas and a face mask, was captured on video screaming and cheering.

[],https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/04/marijuana/should-psychedelic-drugs-be-decriminalized-mass-advocates-see-opening/,[],"Following the passage of a local measure in Somerville, advocates for decriminalizing psychedelic drugs are recruiting legislative allies for a statewide bill.",[''],en,2/4/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"State Representative Mike Connolly, whose district includes large swaths of Somerville and Cambridge and who has been working with the reformers, told the Globe he is planning to file a preliminary bill that would create a committee of public officials, scientists, criminal justice experts, and others to study whether Massachusetts should decriminalize natural psychedelics and legalize their administration in therapeutic settings statewide.

Fresh off that victory, advocates for decriminalizing such drugs are now bringing their fight to Beacon Hill.

Somerville in January became the first jurisdiction in Massachusetts to move toward decriminalizing plant-based psychedelic drugs, with city leaders voting unanimously to recognize the medical uses of natural entheogens — including psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms” — and make them among the lowest enforcement priorities for local police.

Advertisement

The committee also may study whether to decriminalize possession of small amounts of other currently illicit substances.

Supporters hope votes on more substantive bills implementing the group’s recommendations will follow in the 2022 legislative session.

“This ought to be taken out of the realm of the criminal justice system and become part of the way we look at people’s health,” Connolly said. “It may strike some folks as an unconventional approach, but there’s a growing body of evidence that points to how entheogenic substances can offer hope for people struggling with intractable PTSD, depression, and substance use disorder — all of which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated.”

Proponents of overhauling drug laws argue that decades of law enforcement crackdowns have ravaged communities of color and filled prisons while doing little to reduce the availability of illicit drugs or the rates of their use — as illustrated starkly by an overdose crisis that in 2018 alone killed more than 67,000 Americans. Health care professionals, not police officers, they say, should handle what are essentially issues of mental and physical health.

Advertisement

Meanwhile, peer-reviewed research from the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research and other institutions increasingly backs the efficacy of psilocybin and similar compounds as treatment for many conditions, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety (especially for those in end-of-life care), cluster and migraine headaches, and substance-use disorder.

The federal Food and Drug Administration in 2018 designated psilocybin as a “breakthrough” therapy for treatment-resistant depression, clearing the way for accelerated trials after initial studies showed it is far more effective than currently available pharmaceuticals. That determination intensified calls for the federal government to end its designation of psilocybin as a “Schedule 1" drug with no medical use and a high potential for abuse.

Taken in high doses or stressful settings, psilocybin can sometimes cause unpleasant or overwhelming temporary experiences, and in rare cases may exacerbate existing conditions such as schizophrenia.

But experts said such “bad trips” are easily avoided with proper dosing and preparation, and noted the drug isn’t physically toxic or addictive. Tolerance builds almost immediately, making repeated back-to-back trips impractical; the most enthusiastic users indulge perhaps once a month, with one telling the Globe that taking psilocybin more often would be as unappealing as “having chocolate cake for dinner every night.”

Michou Olivera, a 51-year-old Greenfield resident, said taking mushrooms in 2018 helped her end a long struggle with depression, alcoholism, and marijuana abuse that began when she was 13 in response to relentless bullying about her masculine appearance and voice.

“I lived in a world that was full of black, horrible darkness — I was imprisoned by myself, by my cravings, by feelings of worthlessness. It seemed insurmountable,” Olivera said. “What psilocybin did was allow me to see the roadblocks and what was holding me back without feeling shame.’'

Today, Olivera said, she has happily embraced her identity and appearance, hasn’t touched alcohol in over two years, and has enrolled in college to study psychology in hopes of one day treating others with psilocybin. Like other proponents, she believes the drug can offer benefits even to healthy people, pointing to studies that show psilocybin often has a positive and lasting effect on well-being.

The idea of decriminalizing psychedelic drugs isn’t necessarily far-fetched.

Solid majorities of voters in Oregon last year approved ballot initiatives authorizing psychedelic therapy and replacing criminal penalties for drug possession with a $100 fine (which is waived if the defendant agrees to a health evaluation). Washington, D.C., and other progressive cities from Oakland to Ann Arbor have implemented similar measures, all following in the footsteps of Portugal, where 20 years of decriminalization and aggressive public health and harm-reduction measures have cut overdose deaths by about 80 percent without increasing rates of drug use.

Still, decriminalization proponents acknowledge that their Massachusetts campaign will be an uphill climb, at least initially, with the Legislature distracted by more pressing matters and lawmakers generally lagging behind the public on drug policy. There are also decades of pervasive anti-drug messaging to overcome.

“If marijuana was too heavy a lift, it’s hard to see how other drugs would be something the Legislature would find easier,” said veteran Massachusetts political observer Steve Koczela of the MassINC Polling Group, referring to lawmakers’ unwillingness to take up cannabis legalization before voters forced the issue with a 2016 ballot initiative. “If it’s going to happen, a ballot question would be the most likely way.”

However, Koczela added, voters are dissatisfied with current policing practices, potentially giving reformers an opening. A 2017 MassINC poll found that, by a 2-to-1 margin, Massachusetts voters agree “drugs should be treated as a health issue and favor investing in treatment over locking up drug dealers.”

Sam Chapman, who helped lead the successful campaign to legalize psychedelic therapy in Oregon, said his group took a largely educational approach after finding that voters weren’t particularly politicized or hardened in their opinions about psilocybin, but knew practically nothing about the drug.

Chapman’s team especially emphasized the potential of psychedelics to treat veterans suffering from PTSD and help communities of color with high rates of mental illness amid the pandemic.

“We led with the science and followed with the personal stories,” Chapman said. “It’s a one-two combo that’s incredibly hard to deny.”

Other than objections from a group of psychiatrists, campaigners in Oregon ran into little organized opposition. Instead, their biggest challenge was addressing the widespread, incorrect assumption that the proposed measure would authorize commercial stores selling magic mushrooms, peyote, and the like.

Advertisement

In reality, Chapman said, supporters are wary of corporate involvement and would prefer to simply decriminalize small-scale peer-to-peer exchanges of psychoactive mushrooms and other entheogenic plants, while making supervised psilocybin therapy available to patients.

Possession of a small quantity of psilocybin is a misdemeanor in Massachusetts. Walpole Police Chief John Carmichael, who represented the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association during the drafting of the state’s marijuana regulations, said officers here very rarely encounter such drugs.

Police groups likely wouldn’t oppose supervised psilocybin therapy, especially for veterans, Carmichael said. He also noted that criminal charges for psychedelics are already unusual, with officers almost always preferring to bring subjects in the throes of a bad trip to the hospital instead of the station.

The primary concern of law enforcement is that decriminalization might encourage greater use of the substances, increasing the risk of encounters between police and impaired people, while decreasing the ability of officers to refer subjects to treatment.

“I’m not a big fan of people who possess drugs going to jail,” Carmichael said. “But it could be an opportunity missed to have a mechanism where people get drug education or treatment if necessary. The goal should be to try to help them abstain from drug use.”

[],https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/25/marijuana/northampton-drops-controversial-fees-marijuana-companies/,[],Mayor David Narkewicz says local cannabis facilities simply haven't had much impact on his city.,[''],en,1/25/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"Under a new policy announced earlier this month, however, Northampton officials won’t charge local cannabis firms anything unless their facilities impose a specific cost or impact.

The city has so far collected over $2.6 million in such ongoing, automatic payments, which are typically pegged at 3 percent of a company’s annual revenue — the legal maximum — and are ostensibly intended to offset potential impacts of marijuana operations such as increased traffic or drug use.

Northampton has become the first municipality in Massachusetts to stop charging local marijuana operators an annual “community impact fee,” after Mayor David Narkewicz said his community has seen few negative effects after years of hosting cannabis companies.

Advertisement

“When the regulations were first put in place and we were negotiating host community agreements, I don’t think anyone knew what the potential impacts would be,” Narkewicz said in an interview Friday. “But now, given more experience, we understand that in most respects these businesses operate like any other business, and none of the impacts they do have lead me to believe they should be treated differently.”

The change, he added, is “an acknowledgement that concerns about the impact of these facilities, which were raised primarily by opponents of legalization, simply haven’t materialized.”

He also said it came from a growing awareness among local officials that community impact fees and other municipal red tape have been an “impediment to smaller marijuana entrepreneurs, in particular equity applicants” who were disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.

Ironically, Northampton’s new policy more or less reflects the intent of community impact fees in the first place, as the state’s 2017 marijuana law says any local fees must be justified by specific, enumerated impacts and costs, up to a ceiling of 3 percent.

However, in the absence of oversight, nearly every cannabis operator in Massachusetts pays its host community the full 3 percent, and the money is often funneled to municipal programs or local nonprofits with only spurious connections to the impact of pot facilities.

Advocates and marijuana businesses have complained for years that the requirement to negotiate a host community agreement (with its attendant fees) before applying for a state license is an invitation for shakedowns and corruption, plus a barrier to smaller firms with less capital.

Their arguments gained traction after federal agents in 2019 arrested then-Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia II for allegedly demanding bribes from applicants for local cannabis business permits; US prosecutors have also convened a grand jury and sought copies of every host community agreement in Massachusetts, amid an ongoing broader investigation into the contracts.

Lawmakers in the Massachusetts House passed a bill last year that would grant the Cannabis Control Commission authority to review the agreements, but the state Senate declined to take it up.

Northampton is one of the few communities in Massachusetts that has kept the community impact fees it collected separate from other revenue, and has so far spent some of its haul improving roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks near the busy New England Treatment Access dispensary. As a result, Narkewicz said the new reduction in fees shouldn’t hurt city coffers during the coronavirus crisis, as officials never stirred that revenue into the city’s general budget and relied on it to pay for staff or programming. (The city will continue to collect the standard 3 percent local tax on recreational marijuana sales, however.)

Advertisement

Northampton hosted one of the first two recreational retailers to open in the state, and today has three operating pot shops, plus a number of other growing and retailing facilities in the licensing pipeline.

Not surprisingly, Northampton marijuana businesses said they were delighted by the change.

Charlotte Hanna, founder of Community Growth Partners, which is working to open a marijuana cultivation facility in the city, said in a statement, “I applaud Mayor Narkewicz’s initiative to waive the community impact fee, and hope that other municipalities will follow his lead and recognize that the myriad of taxes imposed on cannabis companies and consumers has already yielded an abundance of income for the Commonwealth and local communities.” She added, “it’s time for reform in order to disincentivize illicit market activity.”

Cannabis commission regulations now require pot businesses seeking state license renewals to ask their municipalities for a voluntary report detailing the community impact fees they’ve collected and how the money was spent. Advocates hope the requests, though they often go unanswered, will help prompt other communities to trim or eliminate their fees.

[],https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/25/marijuana/dispensary-trade-group-drops-lawsuit-against-state-after-backlash/,[],The surprising turnaround came just days after the Commonwealth Dispensary Association sued state cannabis regulators and accused them of « radically upending the established rules. »,[''],en,1/25/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"Marijuana activists and customers quickly responded with threats of an organized boycott, saying the legal challenge was protectionist and struck at a program meant to benefit Black and brown communities disproportionately targeted by police for marijuana arrests.

The Commonwealth Dispensary Association, which represents dozens of established brick-and-mortar marijuana companies, sued the state Cannabis Control Commission earlier this month to overturn recently implemented regulations that created a new, competing class of online pot-delivery retailers — and that reserve the licenses exclusively for disenfranchised entrepreneurs for three years.

The largest marijuana business association in Massachusetts has dropped a lawsuit against the state after more than a dozen key members of the group quit or renounced the litigation in the face of a fierce backlash from advocates.

Advertisement

That criticism apparently stung. Beginning late Friday, a number of CDA member companies — nearly all of which had previously agreed to file and help fund the litigation — suddenly began announcing they were leaving in protest. By Sunday, at least 10 companies had quit, including New England Treatment Access, the state’s largest marijuana operator and the first to renounce the association.

With the group splintering and support for the lawsuit crumbling among remaining members, CDA’s leaders appeared to have little choice but to withdraw the lawsuit. Still, it was a stunning turnaround from just days earlier, when the group charged publicly that the commission had “overstepped its authority and disregarded state law, radically upending the established rules,” and sought to present a united front of large and small pot retailers.

“The CDA has determined it is in the best interest of the industry and our members to drop the lawsuit against the Cannabis Control Commission,” the association said in a statement provided to the Globe on Sunday. “We all need to be working together on achieving our many shared objectives, including increasing the participation of a diverse set of entrepreneurs in the industry.”

Advertisement

The commission declined to comment, saying it does not discuss litigation.

It is unclear whether the companies that left the CDA will now rejoin the association, or if any of the remaining firms will file a similar lawsuit on their own.

The state’s other primary marijuana business group, the Massachusetts Cannabis Business Association, had supported the new delivery licenses, saying they were critical to achieving equity in an industry that so far has little diversity. The group issued a statement Monday “applaud[ing] the focused, tenacious and downright effective work of advocates to hold the emerging cannabis industry accountable” and pledged to advocate for the removal of barriers keeping smaller players out of the business.

Cannabis organizers also celebrated the CDA’s retreat from court, though they gave little credit to the companies that backed out, noting that most initially backed the litigation.

“This is a victory for conscientious consumers, equity delivery companies, and authentic grass-roots activism,” said Grant Ellis, an advocate and medical marijuana patient who helped organize the pressure campaign. “But the fact remains that, until they were forced to do otherwise by public pressure, CDA members were happy to sabotage the roll out of delivery licenses with a lawsuit that was clearly meant to protect their own profits at the expense of equity and a fair market.”

The new permits at issue will allow delivery companies to operate essentially like existing retailers, buying bulk quantities of marijuana products from suppliers and reselling that inventory to consumers — except they can bring orders directly to consumers’ doorsteps in unmarked vans, with no need for the kind of physical storefronts that often garner neighborhood opposition.

Advertisement

The established brick-and-mortar cannabis shops represented by the CDA lobbied stridently against the creation of the licenses last year, saying such delivery operators would unfairly undermine their businesses and represented a sharp departure from the commission’s earlier vision, under which Uber Eats-style couriers would pick up all delivery orders from traditional marijuana stores.

But advocates successfully pressed the agency to stand by the proposal, which gives entrepreneurs in the commission’s social equity and economic empowerment programs — largely Black and brown entrepreneurs affected by the war on drugs — exclusive access to both types of delivery licenses for three years (beginning when the first such operator opens for business).

The dispensary association’s lawsuit was somewhat narrowly tailored along administrative and procedural grounds: Rather than assaulting the commission’s authority to create such an exclusivity period at all, the complaint argued that state law defines marijuana retailers as having the ability to deliver marijuana. It also challenged the validity of the 3-1 vote in favor of creating the licenses, claiming that former commissioner Shaleen Title was improperly serving beyond the end of her term at the time.

That caution didn’t appease the broad coalition of local advocates, national cannabis justice groups, ordinary consumers, and even public officials who confronted CDA members on social media last week with accusations of racism and demands to explain their participation in the challenge. The industry association responded at first by removing the website listing its members, but it was too late: Activists had already saved the information and began circulating a list of dispensaries to boycott.

Yet no one ever questioned the behavior and antics of my colleagues.",[''],en,2/8/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"In 2019, I became the first Black, Haitian-American woman to be elected for the city councilor at-large seat in my hometown of Everett. I did not run with the label of being the first or being Black. I campaigned on issues critical to my city, and Everett needed the most qualified person in the seat. With my background, family experiences, and work history, I believed I was that person. During my campaign, I spoke about my graduating from Bentley University and obtaining my MBA from Boston University. I talked about how I had eight years of work experience in the corporate and nonprofit sector, and about being a small-business owner.

Black women are commonly stereotyped as too aggressive, too hostile, too angry. Categorizing us with these labels has caused Black women to question how we can look, dress, or even speak to provide a softer image to the outside world. These words can negatively impact our careers, our reputation, and how people look at us.

In 2020, my City Council colleagues went to the media and labeled me as too aggressive and said that my ideas were too bold for Everett. The labels reminded me of the many tropes Black women have historically heard for scores of years. I sat and reflected on whether I was too aggressive to be on the Everett City Council. I still had my career to think about and my small business to protect from the impact of COVID-19.

Being in the public eye, I noticed every moment was critiqued, including how I dressed or how I spoke. The extreme pressure to maintain my composure while being positive and likable was not what I expected. I learned to smile more. Smiling helped me to show the world that it cannot break me. I am stronger and have much more fortitude than that. People told me I had to be like Michelle Obama, and keep my composure and stay calm. Yet no one ever questioned the behavior and antics of my colleagues. After being in office for 10 months, I was asked by my colleagues in October to resign because I chose to keep my family safe during the pandemic by not attending closed-room meetings with up to 15 people, many of whom did not wear masks.

Being in politics is not about keeping the status quo; I want to create real change. I want people to relate to their elected officials. I want to speak my mind and, most important, I do not want to change who I am in order for my colleagues to like me.

As I reflect on this recent presidential election, I remember when people questioned and ridiculed our now vice president, Kamala Harris, when she laughed and smiled. I can only assume how she felt, having to stay calm, disciplined, and courageous in the face of adversity. Simultaneously, doing what many women, especially women of color, often do, balancing being disrespected while maintaining professionalism. Smiling and laughing to get through the journey of showing others the importance of a Black woman rising above being labeled as too aggressive.

At last week’s City Council meeting, the topic was linkage fees. The subject is important to me, since I have tried to fight for more funding to build affordable housing in a community that has needed it for 10 years.

Excerpts from Jan. 25 Everett City Council meeting Share Email to a Friend Embed These clips show an exchange between Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria and Gerly Adrien, city councilor at-large for the City of Everett.

During a robust debate with my colleagues on the issue, Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria attacked me. The mayor said he wished he could turn off “pictures” of some members of the council on the Zoom meeting because they were “laughing” and not taking the issue seriously. He was referring to me. So I raised my hand to speak, knowing I could not stay silent. I told him that his wish that he could turn off the video of the only Black city councilor was disrespectful. He wanted me to disappear, to show viewers that my voice was not significant, and that I did not belong. However, being elected by the people of Everett in 2019, leading the race with the most at-large votes, I knew the community needed me. Yet he tried to embarrass me and make me feel like I did not matter.

Donald Trump did the same thing to Harris. Trump criticized her, saying she laughed too much. I wondered what it was about Black women that scared people like Trump and DeMaria.

As a woman in politics, I am consistently criticized about my hair, my looks, and how I speak.

I am proud to be a Black woman in politics. I will not change who I am or what I have to say.

No matter how others try to define me, I know this much is true: I smile because I like to smile. That will never change. I will continue to work hard on behalf of my city and my neighbors. Most of all, I do belong here.

Across the country, Black and brown people are underrepresented in the total number of people vaccinated. In Massachusetts, Black people, who make up 9 percent of the population and 14 percent of health care workers, account for only 3 percent of people who are fully vaccinated . Latinos account for less than 4 percent, despite constituting 12 percent of the state population and 10 percent of health care workers.

In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, just as racial data on COVID-19 started to become available, the United States had to confront an ugly truth: Black and brown Americans were becoming infected at alarmingly higher rates than their white neighbors, a reality that underscored the racial inequality that has long plagued the country’s health care system. As the crisis wore on, structural racism became all the more visible: Black and brown people are more likely to die of COVID-19 , more likely to lose their jobs , and more likely to fall into poverty .

It’s not hard to look at the racial disparities in vaccinations and see the latest manifestation of the nation’s past sins. Confidence in the vaccine among Black people, for example, is very low because of the long history of racist abuse in the medical community. According to a Globe/Suffolk University poll, only 11 percent of Black people in Massachusetts said they wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible compared with 59 percent of white respondents. But the racial gap in vaccinations was not inevitable, and numbers should be seen for what they are: a scandalous failure on the part of governors who failed to adequately plan to go after the coronavirus in the hardest-hit areas.

Unfortunately, Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts is one of those governors. “Frankly, the state has botched the vaccination rollout,” said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, an antidiscrimination advocacy group in Boston. “The program is almost an afterthought when it comes to people of color and immigrants.”

Indeed, Massachusetts has failed in implementing its vaccination plan so far, especially in marginalized communities, as US Representative Ayanna Pressley expressed in a letter to the governor: “I remain gravely concerned that your administration’s vaccination and response plans continue to fall short of serving the needs of the communities most impacted.”

For his part, Baker had pledged early on that 20 percent of the vaccine supply would be reserved for communities that were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 in the second and third phases of vaccine distribution. But it’s clear that those communities needed to see that kind of prioritization sooner.

Though the state neglected to set up these sites at the start of distribution, more have cropped up in recent days, though not nearly enough. After a delay because of the recent snowstorm, the state finally opened up a vaccine clinic at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center at Roxbury Community College to make the vaccine more accessible to some Black residents — over a month after vaccine distribution began. But it appears that the majority of people getting vaccinated at that site are white. This trend can be seen across the country, where wealthier white residents are more likely to get vaccinated at sites in poorer Black and brown neighborhoods.

These problems need to be addressed before the vaccine becomes more widely available, and it will require the involvement of the federal government. Pressley, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, urged federal health agencies to start collecting comprehensive racial vaccination data, since not all states are doing so. The federal government should heed their call; if the degree of racial disparity is unknown, then states can’t effectively create more equitable vaccine rollouts.

On the state level, it’s a matter of rebuilding trust and increasing accessibility. “It’s as simple as connecting with trusted community partners that people have been going to since the beginning of the pandemic for information on how to keep themselves and their families safe,” Espinoza-Madrigal said. “Leverage the ties that these community groups have already developed over the course of the pandemic.”

If governments don’t respond to the racial vaccination gap quickly, the problem will only get worse. Marginalized communities will continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic, and the country will come out of this disaster more unequal and more unjust than it was before.

They’re cute. They’re tasty. And they’re coming soon to a table in front of a TV near you. Made in a muffin tin, the taco cups have corn tortillas as the base with a filling of black beans, plenty of cheese, and spicy ground chicken, turkey, or beef. To make the cups, square off corn tortillas by cutting off the round edges. You will need to warm them slightly to make them flexible; a microwave is the fastest route to do this or wrap them in foil and heat them in a low oven. Then press them into muffin cups and bake them for a few minutes to firm them up. The meat filling, with chunky salsa and canned beans, takes only a few minutes to prep. After the cups are shaped, fill them, bake again, and top with avocado and sour cream. Maybe not a regular Super Bowl Sunday, but the snacks will be good.

Crispy Potato Skins with Kielbasa and Cheese. Sheryl Julian

A bar food staple since the 1980s, potato skins have remained popular for their simple but classic pairing of crispy potato and melted cheese. For the Super Bowl, they’re a perfect addition to the snack buffet. To get extra-crisp skins, bake large russet potatoes, scoop out the flesh (turn it into potato pancakes the next day), brush the insides with butter, sprinkle with salt, and bake the empty skins a second time. Fill them with browned kielbasa and Gruyere, or another cheese you like, and broil them briefly to melt the cheese and crisp the top edges yet again. Sour cream and chives finish the dish. Bake the whole potatoes in advance, if you like, but wait to halve them until you’re ready to bake the scooped-out skins. Don’t skip the sour cream; it adds an essential tang.

Chicken Tenders with Chipotle-Yogurt Sauce. Karoline Boehm Goodnick

Baked and breaded chicken tenders taste a lot like the deep-fried version. These stay juicy in the heat of the oven from a quick brine (up to two hours is sufficient; don’t let them sit overnight because the vinegar in the brine will start to pickle the tenders). While they bake, make a yogurt dipping sauce with canned chipotle peppers, which shine here. Chop them with whatever sauce clings to the pepper as you pull it from the can. Save the rest of the peppers to add to chili, beef stew, or a chicken casserole.

Icelandic trail riding

They’re ancestors of the Vikings’ horses, a breed that’s been purely bred for more than 1,000 years. They’re friendly and easy-going, and comfortable to ride. They’re cute, too. Those are some of the things you’ll learn on this 90-minute adventure package offered by the award-winning Hartstone Inn & Hideaway in Camden, Maine.

You’ll meet the horses at Pepper Hill Farm, located about 15 minutes from the inn in South Thomaston, and then ride the picturesque, groomed trails. Riding is offered year-round (the indoor arena is used during inclement weather) and no experience is needed. The package also includes a two-night stay in a room of your choice, and a chef’s multi-course dinner for two on one night, from $480-$918.

Ask Len Libby matriarch Maureen Hemond: Lenny was her idea, back in the 1990s. “We were already making chocolate mousse candy, a soft center mousse dipped in chocolate,” she says. And she’d seen some sculptural chocolate creations on her travels. But an actual chocolate moose — the largest antlered animal in North America, no less — would be so fabulous, and so Maine. Her husband, Master Chocolatier Fern Hemond, wasn’t amused. “He thought we were crazy,” Maureen says.

SCARBOROUGH, Maine — Need more proof that New England is, indeed, the best place on the planet (and probably the wackiest)? Consider this: Maine is home to the largest chocolate moose — yes, that’s moose — in the world. His name is Lenny, he weighs 1,700 pounds, is 9 feet long and 7 feet tall, and has been making candy-crazed kids squeal with delight since 1997. Lenny resides in a blue-tinted white chocolate pond at Len Libby Candies, along with a 380-pound chocolate black bear named Libby and her 80-pound cubs, Cocoa and Chip. Gawkers are welcome, but don’t count on sneaking a piece of Lenny when nobody’s looking. “We’ve got a fence up now, because everybody wants a bite!” says John DeGrinney, who runs the business with his wife, Gisele. This edible ungulate may well be the largest chocolate animal — never mind moose — in existence. (“We’ve never heard of a larger one!” DeGrinney says.) Lenny has been featured on TV’s “Good Morning America” and in the board game Trivial Pursuit. Try finding another moose who’s done that.

But they did it, preparing the chocolate themselves and enlisting students from the Maine School of Art to make the moose. Steel beams and wire mesh support 10-pound blocks of real chocolate, which was applied like paste to the sculptural base. Sculptor Zdeno Mayercak, who had never worked in chocolate before, chipped away, one chocolate curl at a time, to make the life-like Lenny. (His inspiration, they say: The stuffed moose in the lobby of L.L. Bean in Freeport.) Project Lenny took a entire month and cost $50,000, Hemond says. Media outlets as far away as Europe picked up the story. The bear came along a few years later, to give Lenny some company. A video monitor plays the story of Lenny’s creation on a continuous loop.

Showcased in a woodsy-themed corner of the candy store, Lenny has attained celebrity status. “People who were here before bring their kids and grandkids,” DeGrinney says. “You can hear them squealing from across the building. It’s the best part of the job,” he adds. The shop sells little Lenny likenesses, in milk and dark chocolate, along with “moose on the rocks” (a chocolate moose with chocolate pebbles) and numerous other moose- and bear-themed confections.

But Lenny and company are just part of the sweet story at Len Libby. Libby, “considered the dean of Maine candy makers,” according to DeGrinney, opened the shop in 1926. It has always been a family business. Libby sold it to Dr. Fernand Hemond in 1949, and his son Fern (Maureen’s late husband) took it over in 1956; now, their kids and assorted nieces and nephews work alongside Maureen, age 81, John, and Gisele, who’s Maureen and Fern’s daughter. That’s four generations of candy-making.

They make 95 percent of the candy they sell, in a candy kitchen attached the shop. Besides Lenny, they’re known for their Maine Needhams, made with fresh coconut they crack themselves (“Nobody does it like we do,” DeGrinney says), and Bangor Taffy. The taffy, a rich caramel rolled in confectioner’s sugar, was served on the Maine Central Railroad more than a century ago. The company continues to make it using the original recipe.

Fans come to pay their respects to Lenny, but they always leave with a little something besides a selfie. This 5,000 square-foot space is filled to the rafters with goodies and Maine-themed gift items. This summer, the family hopes to open a viewing window to their candy kitchen, so customers can see the magic happen.

Speaking of magic, how is it that Lenny looks so fresh and dewy at 24 years old? Let’s just say he’s had some work done. “Every couple of years, we scrape him and clean him and put another layer of tempered chocolate on him,” DeGrinney says. Hmmm: Exfoliation, cleansing, a layer of chocolate — might be worth a try.

A boat cruise from Cedar Key will take you into a watery world of bayous and bays, and places with cool names like Atsena Otie and Snake Key. Diane Bair

Cedar Key: 700 (or so) people, stories galore

“We have magical stories here,” says Vice-Mayor Sue Colson. Ask her about how dolphins saved the local police chief, a true story. Just don’t ask her to entertain you — that’s not how it’s done in this low-key zone on Florida’s northwest coast. “We don’t entertain people,” she says. “Just get yourself a golf cart and our walking tour booklet and see it all at your own pace.”

You won’t stumble upon Cedar Key by accident, you have to want to find it — it is located three miles into the Gulf of Mexico and reachable via a series of four bridges. “Cedar Key” isn’t actually a key, it’s a city on Way Key; the Cedar Keys are a group of 13 islands. Formerly a fishing village, Cedar Key is now the largest producer of farmed clams in the country. Locals are quick to mention that Tony’s Clam Chowder, studded with homegrown clams, has won the Newport Great Chowder Cook-Off so many times that they can no longer compete. (We tried it. Delicious.)

So what else do you do in Cedar Key? Dock Street is a major draw, home to shops, bars, and restaurants on stilts that date back to the early 1900s. Dock Street once marked the end of the railroad that ran from the Atlantic to the Gulf, transporting folks to Cedar Key, the second oldest city in the state. History is everywhere here; there’s even a shell mound next to the community center. Soak up the vibe at the Neptune Bar, a beloved local watering hole, at the Island Hotel (c. 1860). See if you can find the bullet hole in the mural, a testament to this property’s rowdy past.

But you won’t stay indoors for long. The glories of Cedar Key are best seen on a boat cruise through myriad bayous and bays. Hop aboard a trip with Tidewater Boat Tours (www.tidewatertours.com) to enjoy Instagram-worthy scenery and hear island lore as you slip past pristine islets like Atsena Otie, Snake Key, and Seahorse Key under a swirl of white pelicans. You’ll want to come back, if only to experience a perfect scoop of luscious white beach on far-flung North Key. Plus, it’s a given that you’ll return. Arriving back in Boston, we had a text message from Colson that read: “You are now part of our Cedar Key family. Come home soon!” We were feeling the small-town love.

Top spots to stay and eat: Sitting atop the businesses-on-stilts on Dock Street, Harbour Master Suites (www.cedarkeyharbourmaster.com: from $135) are steps away from the fishing pier, beach and city park. The roomy suites have refrigerators and microwave ovens, and the best amenity: views of the Gulf of Mexico. For breakfast, don’t miss the crab cake Benedict at Duncan’s On the Gulf (352-543-8004). Plan for a bite at the Island Hotel (www.islandhotel-cedarkey.com). For a starter, order Bessie Gibson’s heart of palm salad; the dish originated here, they say. And see if you think the clam chowder at Tony’s Seafood (www.tonyschowder.com) is worthy of the plaudits.

There’s a free-flying vibe in Fernandina Beach. If you want to decorate your porch with carousel ponies, go for it. Diane Bair

Fernandina Beach: Pirates, hippies, and charm to spare

Located off Florida’s northeast coast, thirty minutes from Jacksonville, Amelia Island isn’t a secret: Condé Nast Traveler has named it among the top 10 “best islands” in the United States. But there’s more to the story than upscale resorts and beaches. The island’s main city, Fernandina Beach, is as vibrant as a Florida sunset, thanks to a 50-block historic district lined with well-maintained Victorian buildings. Its history is just as colorful, peopled with pirates, Gilded Age millionaires, bootleggers, and shrimpers. Soak up the vibe in the Palace Saloon (c. 1903), which bills itself as the oldest bar in Florida. Former mayor Johnny Miller is a bartender there, a gig he maintained while in office. Writer John Grisham has a home here, too.

“Hippies and cowboys co-exist here,” a resident told us as we poked around Fernandina Beach. “People land on the island, and they never leave.”

Hippies and cowboys happily co-exist in Fernandina Beach, locals say, along with pirate lore and Florida’s oldest bar. Diane Bair

Streets are canopied with massive live oak trees, including a street built with a split in the middle to accommodate an ancient specimen. A bicycle tour is a fun way to explore. Riptide Watersports (www.riptidewatersports.com) offers guided tours and beach bike rentals. Among other sites, you’ll see a home made of tabby (an oyster shell mixture) and the Bailey house, famously festooned with antique carousel horses that the owners found in its attic.

There’s a state park worth visiting on both ends of the island. At the southern tip, Amelia Island State Park offers a fun option: horseback riding on the beach. On the northernmost point, with views of Georgia’s Cumberland Island, Fort Clinch State Park is a plummy spot for hiking, camping, and birding at the site of a 19th-century masonry fort.

You don’t have to go far to find solitude and gorgeous nature. A paddling excursion off Walker’s Landing at Omni Amelia Island Plantation reveals a peaceful world of saltmarsh and bayous. Think dolphins and shore birds, not Jet-Skis. “People don’t realize that this exists here,” said kayak guide John Putrino.

Top spots to stay and eat: The 402-room Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort (www.omnihotels.com/ameliaisland; from $199) is a local landmark, with shopping, dining, golf, a nature center and kids’ camp. Off property, Timoti’s Seafood Shak (www.timotis.com) offers fresh local seafood and terrific salads (figs + feta + blackened fish=yum.) Lagniappe (www.lagniappeamelia.com), located near the resort, wins raves for updated French Creole menu.

High Springs: A Gator-approved escape

Gainesville is famous for its Gators (the University of Florida football team) and as the birthplace of rocker Tom Petty. What you might not know: The city is an ideal base for discovering a treasure-trove of Olde Florida spots. “It takes 25 minutes or less to get from Gainesville to quaint, historical country towns like High Springs, Cross Creek, and Micanopy,” also in Alachua (ah-LATCH-you-uh) County, says Elizabeth Reyes of Visit Gainesville (www.VisitGainesville.com).

Our pick for most charming spot: High Springs (population 6,000), north of Gainesville. En route, stop for a look at one of Mother Nature’s curiosities, Devil’s Millhopper Geological State Park, a 120-foot-deep, 500-feet-across sinkhole. This natural landmark draws researchers to study the shark teeth, marine animals, and fossilized remains of extinct land animals found in the sink.

Arrive in High Springs in time for lunch so you can sample the hearty Southern fare (say, griddled redfish with fried green tomatoes and Gouda grits) at the Great Outdoors Restaurant. Downtown is fairly small, but inviting, with newly painted murals and several antiques/vintage shops, a bakery, and an art gallery. Some new businesses have sprung up recently, Pink Flamingo Diner and High Springs Brewing Company.

But the main event is outdoors: High Springs is the gateway to the largest concentration of freshwater springs in the world. The best way to experience them is on a canoe or kayak trip on the Santa Fe River. Canoe Outpost (www.santaferiver.com) offers rentals and tours, and can set you up to camp overnight along the way, if you’re into adventure. “This is a piece of heaven on earth,” says owner Jim Wood, noting that you can encounter more than seven springs — perfect for a quick dip — even on a short trip. The water temperature at the springs is 72 degrees year-’round, and there are no rapids or whitewater, Wood says, “just alligators, turtles, bald eagles, and deer.”

It’s a side of the Sunshine State that many visitors don’t see. “We’re a destination for those who want to dig a little deeper and have an authentic experience in the heart of North Central Florida — maybe enjoy a farm-to-table dinner in a bio-organic farm, or take in an outdoor live music show without fighting traffic and crowds,” says Reyes.

Top spots to stay and eat: Since High Springs is so close to Gainesville, we opted to stay in the city. The Sweetwater Branch Inn (www.sweetwaterinn.com; from $139) was a perfect choice. A short walk from downtown restaurants, parks, and the historic Hippodrome Theatre, the property includes two Victorian homes and modern stand-alone cottages (25 rooms total), plus a heated saltwater pool and spa and a lavish breakfast. In High Springs, the Great Outdoors Restaurant (www.greatoutdoorsrestaurant.com) is housed in a former opera house-turned outdoor store, and the food is reliably good. Bonus: Live music and a menu of local microbrews. www.VisitGainesville.com, www.highspringschamber.com

Throughout the book, they endure and absorb the losses of those around them. It’s their lot to define and then articulate the indescribable emptiness and lack that accompanies the burden of survival. The collection’s titular opening story could, at first, feel like a tale too often told. Two friends — one white, Kiera; one Black, Ava — are bonded to one another through a shared feeling of drowning. Different backgrounds, different parenting styles, the same ennui: adolescence is a period of ceaseless misunderstandings. What 13-year-old doesn’t feel adrift?

Although her stories are as emotionally gutting as the wake of a hurricane, Dantiel W. Moniz deserves more than the easy weather metaphors that come to mind. A resident of northern Florida, Moniz is an achingly insightful and soulful writer who deserves more than that. Her blistering range is evident in the 11 stories of her stunning debut collection, “ Milk Blood Heat ,” all of which are set in the Sunshine State.

It’s Moniz’s steady pacing that ratchets up the story’s tension. Moniz possesses a calm ability to capture unspoken yet palpable awkwardness and disconnect. Picking up Ava from Kiera’s house, her single, exhausted mother asks, “‘Why every time I come get you from this girl’s house, you’re always a mess. Both her parents live here and they can’t watch y’all?’ And Ava says nothing because words never mean what she wants them to.” Ava’s already seized with an emptiness and “wonders if she will ever be rid of it, and other times she never wants to give it back. It is a thing she owns.” Ava recognizes that complicated emotions are nevertheless gifts which may take years to manifest as something more valuable than pain.

As young girls do, they celebrate their tangible suffering. A shared bowl of milk spiked with each other’s blood seals their friendship. “Pink is the color for girls,” says Kiera, searching for common ground, but also immune to racism or responsibility. She “leaves the bowl, spoon, and knife in the sink for her mother to wash.” Noting that specific domestic moment, Moniz pauses in the kitchen as though taking measure of the barometric pressure.

Throughout the book, it’s these sustained beats, reverberating with gravity, that give the book texture and depth. Novels can take the time to move more slowly with actions and words accumulating over chapters. But stories face a steeper challenge. Short stories require tactical effort to bridge brevity with emotional impact. Like many readers, I approach short stories with skepticism. Somehow, novels remain fiction’s standard-bearer. When lesser story collections fall short of their mark, I somehow blame the form rather than the writer or subject. Nevertheless, it’s been short stories such as Bryan Washington’s “Lot,” Lidia Yuknavitch’s “Verge,” and Deesha Philyaw’s “The Secret Lives of Church Ladies” most recently, which have dazzled me while many novels leave me lukewarm.

Moniz seizes on these moments — an embrace that collapses time, a blessing in a bar’s bathroom stall, a raft too far from shore, one drink too many, the decision to forgo cancer treatment, “the acceptable order the guests could see, and the chaos that made it possible” — to remind her characters that living isn’t easy or free. The easy pleasures which Florida offers in vast supply also come with a cost. Where others may sail past the price, Moniz makes it her focus. Actions mean more than words, but as a writer, Moniz knows that words are the connective tissue that give us the faith we need to carry on. How she illuminates that reasoning through direct and unwavering language is downright magical.

In “Outside the Raft,” two cousins spend a summer with their evangelical grandmother, of whom it’s said “Woman sees devils in everything. … Except when they’re right in front of her face.” After their Bible study, one cousin muses, “I had never seen a god, nor smelled one. Never tasted its sunshine flesh.” Later, throwing rocks at a wasp’s nest, she declares to her cousin Tweet that there was no God. While she misses, Tweet “found the nest with a soft twap and knocked it loose. The nest hit the ground and we ran for cover as the wasps flew out, their violent droning filling the air as they searched for somewhere to place the blame. They disappeared into the unmoving sky, leaving silence in their wake.”

“‘God’s real,’ Tweet said, and headed for the house. She left me standing in the yard alone.” Words punctuate the wrath and mystery of a natural and spiritual world in this tremendous and sensual collection. While these stories are not directly connected other than by geography, the book frequently cycles back to mother-daughter connections. Mothers possess the ability to capture “everything you needed to know” by uttering the word, “girl.” A wayward mother, who wordlessly cleans up after her daughter, confesses that “Sometimes the voice of God was silence.” With worlds collapsed into single words and answers found in emptiness, Moniz empowers readers to find potential in lack. There’s always trouble brewing in the Gulf of Mexico, but Florida is a rich landscape for characters who dare to endure despite the ravages of body and mind in “Milk Blood Heat.”

The daughter of a hippie mom who’s absconded to India, 17-year-old Gentle has been kicked out of the private girls’ school the others attend, is often high, wears bell-bottoms, and was once caught swinging on the local monkey bars, naked. “Everything about Gentle is grubby and unwashed,” notes Eulabee, “but this is the eighties and the eighties are clean, and the colors are bright and separated.” In the world of Eulabee and her friends, Guess jeans, Esprit tops, Lanz of Salzberg and Laura Ashley nightgowns, Swatch watches, and Lilly Pulitzer prints abound — though Maria Fabiola has also been leaning toward figure-hugging Fiorucci T-shirts.

“We are thirteen, almost fourteen, and these streets of Sea Cliff are ours.” Thus opens Vendela Vida’s exhilarating, maddening, thoroughly entertaining novel, “ We Run the Tides .” The irresistible voice belongs to narrator Eulabee, who has an often-askew sense of humor, a mostly fine-tuned sense of observation, and a tightly knit posse of girlfriends — Maria Fabiola, Faith, and Julia — who rule their neighborhood roost in Sea Cliff, a swish enclave of 1980s San Francisco.

The quartet of eighth-grade girls can feel their new power coming on. Though they attend that all-girls’ school, they “know where the boys live…”; they spend their sleepovers rating boys in yearbooks from Faith’s previous school; and a night out at the movies to see “The Breakfast Club” fuels them with particularly electrifying energy: “We watch the movie with rapt attention and with glee. When we leave the theater we are delirious. … We want to want. We want to love. We want to want love. We are on the precipice of having real boyfriends, of making out with them. We know this. We can feel this urge pulsating through our bodies…”

There’s a lot of pent-up energy in these girls’ lives with none-too-many obvious outlets. Apart, that is, from ballet lessons and dancing school — “All of us … go to ballroom dancing school because that’s where you meet the boys who go to the all-boys’ schools” — and roughhousing on the beach, where Eulabee and Maria Fabiola excel at running between two promontory-separated beaches at low tide by watching the waves.

Advertisement

Eulabee admits early in the book that she’s dabbled in the fine art of lying. A year earlier, while she and Maria Fabiola were selling lemonade, Eulabee lied outright a to a neighbor — who clearly didn’t recognize the early-blooming Maria Fabiola — claiming that her friend was her newly adopted sister. Then, in a scene that manages to be hilarious while also generating a downright physical, “Oh, NO!” sensation, the girls knock on nearby doors and introduce Maria Fabiola in her fictitious role. The inevitable outcome — having to retrace those steps, “apologizing to stern faces” — will ring true to anyone who overstepped their storytelling boundaries as a teen.

But darker dynamics lurk within Sea Cliff and its inhabitants, from the downfall of a doctor’s family whose sons turned to drugs to a father’s closet concealing his stash of Playboy magazines with his gun. When Eulabee’s buddies try to involve her in a claim they make about a man whose path they cross on their way to school, and Eulabee, who noticed nothing amiss, refuses to go along with their lie, the entire tenor of their friendship changes. Eulabee gets the cold shoulder, is disinvited from parties, and finds herself in a loneliest of spots: “A lunch without friends is a lunch that’s too long.”

Advertisement

Even as Eulabee is trying to wend her way through eighth-grade as a sudden social pariah, a family’s worst fears come all-too-palpably to life: Maria Fabiola disappears on her walk home from school, and the police begin to investigate the disappearance as a kidnapping.

In a book full of narratives, some more imaginative and convoluted than others, often conflicting, sometimes heart-breaking, Vida holds her own narrative steady with Eulabee’s distinct voice. While she’s got some all-too-human blind spots, Eulabee is pretty clued-in and clear-eyed about others’ actions, and her unusual sense of humor comes hand-in-hand with a healthy dose of scepticism, particularly when it comes to adults’ foibles and faults. (She’s downright funny too: a diaphragm in a science sex-education class at school resembles “a pink trampoline for a rodent.”) In a particularly telling scene, when her art-and-antiques-dealer dad brings home what he believes to be a painting by one Vanessa Bell, it turns out that Eulabee knows more about Virginia Woolf’s sister and the Bloomsbury group than her dad does.

Through Eulabee’s eyes, Vida gives us visceral insight into the other characters, sometimes with just a sentence or two. Faith’s mother, for example, “acts like life is a large broken car she’s pushing down the road. She walks diagonally, as though she’s making her way through a rainstorm, even on the fairest of days.” Or Maria Fabiola’s mother, who “wore large sunglasses so opaque that sometimes it appeared she had difficulty seeing through the lenses. She often lifted them up in an attempt to get a better view, and then let them fall back over her eyes as though disappointed at what things really looked like.”

With its tangible, tactile details peppered throughout and super-smart, quirky Eulabee at its helm, “We Run the Tides” is deceptively sweet — and as addictive as candy.

This is Lee’s sixth novel; an earlier book, “ The Surrendered ,” was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2010. He is a professor of creative writing at Stanford University.

LEE: I’m rereading Henry James’s “The Portrait of a Lady.” I first read it in college more than 30 years ago. Back then I admired that it was beautifully written but as an immigrant kid from South Korea I wasn’t into stories about people trying to get married and up their social standing. It all seemed antiquated and silly to me, all these privileged people having all this trouble.

Advertisement

BOOKS: What classics spoke to you then?

LEE: Hemingway’s “In Our Time” and his short stories about soldiers in the Spanish Civil War where class and customs weren’t so ingrained into the narrative. Or reading “Leaves of Grass” by Walt Whitman, who wrote about his embracing all the diversity of America.

BOOKS: Is the James typical of your reading?

LEE: Typically I read a lot of contemporary fiction. Some of the last novels I read are Susan Choi’s “Trust Exercise,” Katie Kitamura’s “A Separation,” and Sigrid Nunez’s “The Friend.” I’m a pretty eclectic reader. I’ll read anything. Sometimes I’ll pick up Ray Bradbury. I will pick up contemporary poetry or the English Romantic poets.

BOOKS: Which contemporary poets have you been reading?

LEE: In recent years I’ve been teaching a class in Asian-American literature, so have read a lot of Asian-American poets, like Garrett Kaoru Hongo, Li-Young Lee, and David Mura.

BOOKS: Do you make a point of reading Asian-American novelists?

Advertisement

LEE: I don’t make a point of it, though Sigrid Nunez is partially Asian. I have read nearly all of the work of the British-Asian writer Kazuo Ishiguro. I like his early books, maybe mostly because they spoke to me when I was first wanting to become a writer. His two early novels, “A Pale View of Hills” and “An Artist of the Floating World,” are beautiful.

BOOKS: What was the first book that made you think of being a writer?

LEE: Probably “Dubliners” by James Joyce. I was really taken by the texture and rhythms of his prose. Even though early-20th-century Irish culture was unfamiliar territory for me I could see the people and almost smell them. And that collection ends with “The Dead,” one of the greatest stories ever written.

BOOKS: When did you become the reader that you are?

LEE: I always read a lot, partly out of necessity and a little bit of desperation. I learned English as a schoolboy. My mother and my teachers impressed on me the absolute need to read, not to become a lover of books, but to learn the language. Then I ended up loving books.

BOOKS: Did you have many books in your household?

LEE: In our first years in the US we had nothing, and my parents weren’t going to spend money on books. There was a truck that went around that gave kids free books. It looked like an ice cream truck. That was really important for us. It was from a program called Reading Is Fundamental, which is for kids who don’t have a library nearby or reading isn’t part of the family culture.

Advertisement

BOOKS: What new books are you looking forward to reading in 2021?

LEE: There’s a lot. Peter Ho Davies has a new book, “A Lie That Someone Told You About Yourself,” which is a kind of an autobiographical novel about fatherhood. Jhumpa Lahiri has a new novel, “Whereabouts,” which she wrote in Italian and translated back into English, which is really cool.

BOOKS: Has the pandemic and the political turmoil affected your reading somehow?

LEE: I read a lot more news. Like a lot of people I got obsessed with all the crappy things that are happening. It was kind of self-destructive. I’m hoping I don’t have to do that anymore.

By the next day more than a hundred people were dead, 35 blocks were burned, and more than 4,000 were left homeless. “MLK/FBI” director Sam Pollard’s documentary “Goin’ Back to T-Town” (1993), an oral history told by survivors of the massacre, describes not only the event in vivid detail but also relates the history of a community that had prospered during the Oklahoma oil boom in the early part of the 20th century, earning the sobriquet “The Black Wall Street.”

During Black History Month in February, several trenchant and illuminating documentaries will provide insight into the Black experience in America. Here are four available for viewing this week.

Though Greenwood lay in smoking ruins after the massacre, the residents refused to leave. Instead, they rebuilt the community, and it regained its status as an economic and cultural hub.

Ironically, what racial violence could not achieve was brought about by the civil rights movement. Black residents in the newly integrated city began to patronize establishments that previously excluded them, neglecting their own local businesses. Developers exploited the area and blighting highways were built across it. Some of those interviewed say that their lives were better during the Jim Crow era. “We have nothing,” says one old-timer. “We got integration, and suffocation, and degradation.”

“Goin’ Back to T-Town,” first broadcast in 1993, will have an encore broadcast on “American Experience” on Feb. 8 at 9 p.m. on PBS, PBS.org, and the PBS Video App. Go to www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/t-town.

A portrait of Black art

While “Goin’ Back to T-Town” memorializes a Black community in decline, “Black Art: In the Absence of Light” (2021), also directed by Sam Pollard, celebrates a Black cultural renaissance. In 1976 the late Black artist and scholar David Driskell curated the exhibit “Two Centuries of Black American Art” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, an exhibition of works by often overlooked Black artists. Controversial in its time, the show proved seminal, inspiring generations of Black artists.

Advertisement

Featuring interviews with Driskell and more than a dozen contemporary Black artists, the film chronicles the rise of Black art from the obscurity of the mid-19th century represented by enslaved master ceramicist David Drake to the exhilarating wave of artists whose original visions have revitalized contemporary art.

Among the more familiar of the numerous works featured are the stunning and unconventional official portraits of Barack Obama by Kehinde Wiley and of Michelle Obama by Amy Sherald. Others include Kara Walker’s silhouette cutouts that depict with sardonic humor sometimes grotesque instances of racial and sexual conflict, and Radcliffe Bailey’s haunting, eloquent installation “Windward Coast” (2009-2011), a depiction of the Middle Passage of enslaved people shipped to America, in which a bust of an African is about to be overwhelmed by a “sea” of piano keys. This is an essential and revelatory glimpse at the accomplishments of today’s Black artists.

“Black Art: In the Absence of Light,” debuts Feb. 9 at 9 p.m. on HBO and is available for streaming on HBO Max. Go to www.hbo.com/documentaries/black-art-in-the-absence-of-light.

Polarization after a police shooting

Advertisement

In 2014, rookie NYPD officer Peter Liang, a Chinese-American, was on an investigation with his partner at a Brooklyn housing project. As they climbed an unlit stairway they heard a noise from above. Panicking, Liang fired a shot and struck and killed Akai Gurley, an unarmed Black man. The nascent Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets demanding justice. Liang, stricken with remorse after his fatal error, was prosecuted and convicted of manslaughter — a charge later downgraded to criminally negligent homicide. He was the first officer held culpable for a police killing in New York in over a decade.

In her documentary “Down a Dark Stairwell” (2020), filmmaker and Newton native Ursula Liang (no relation to the police officer) follows this story from the beginning, and it proves far more complex than a straightforward case of a policeman finally paying the price for killing an innocent Black person. The officer, like the victim, was a person of color, and the Chinese community wondered if he had been chosen as a scapegoat because of his race. Like the Black Lives Matter activists, they also demonstrated for justice. In this nuanced and affecting account of the conflict and dialogue between the two communities, Liang shows how the ongoing struggle for racial equality is not just a matter of black and white.

“Down a Dark Stairwell” is available on demand on ArtsEmerson’s digital venue through Feb. 7 at 10 p.m. It will be broadcast on April 12 at 10 p.m. on the PBS series “Independent Lens.” Go to bit.ly/3jgmU4v.

The women in blue who pushed on

Appointed Minneapolis police chief in 2012, Janeé Harteau, the first woman and the first openly gay person to take the position, faced a challenge in turning around a department notorious for misconduct and racist behavior. As seen in Deirdre Fishel’s engaging and incisive “Women in Blue” (2020), Harteau knew that women had been proven to be more skilled in conflict resolution. She hoped to reform the department by elevating women and women of color to leadership positions. But that plan was forgotten when Harteau’s tenure ended abruptly in 2017 after a Black officer was accused of shooting an unarmed, innocent white woman.

That left the remaining women on the force on their own. Fishel follows three of them who, tough and resilient and frequently discouraged, soldiered on. But as the death of George Floyd in May 2020 demonstrated, systemic racism and other problems afflicting the Minneapolis Police Department have yet to be overcome.

The actors and directors you get to interview about their choices and dreams; my critical colleagues from around the country and the world, swapping responses and recommendations (and warnings); the festivalgoers on the shuttle buses, dazzled and exhausted; the army of volunteers, young and old, that make Sundance happen year after year in exchange for the excitement of just being there. (And the skiers; paradoxically, the festival is a great time to hit the slopes because everyone else is at the movies.) The streaming technology that delivered films to my home screen performed without a snag, but I’ve never been more potently reminded that movies are meant to be experienced as part of a crowd.

How discombobulating is an online Sundance Film Festival? In past years, I’ve occasionally had trouble flying home from Utah due to heavy snowstorms on the East Coast. In 2021, I just went outside and shoveled my driveway. It’s been a surreal edition of the storied Park City event, but hardly an unsuccessful one, with record-breaking film sales and a clutch of very fine movies. The awards ceremonies were held Tuesday night and “ CODA ,” the opening night drama about a Gloucester teen and her family of deaf fishermen, cleaned up with grand jury and audience awards for US Drama, plus prizes for its director (Cambridge-born Siân Heder) and ensemble cast. Is it a great movie? Maybe not, but it’s awfully easy to love.

Some of the offerings directly or indirectly addressed our fragmenting social scene. “Searchers,” from Pacho Velez, a Boston filmmaker (“Manakamana”) relocated to New York City, is a wry and wistful documentation of the dating-app scene, filmed in a series of close-ups as the subjects, representing all ages, colors, and genders, peer into Tinder or Grindr or Match.com and puzzle over the mysteries of modern love. That “Searchers” was filmed in the summer of 2020, with masked Manhattanites out and about, makes it seem both modern and nostalgic, and Velez is unafraid to put himself in his own viewfinder. The movie’s a lot less slight than initially plays.

Sundance always has its share of wackadoo entries, whether they’re programmed in the “Next” section or not. Some of them come packaged as ready-made cult items, like “Prisoners of the Ghostland,” a mash-up of Westerns, crime thrillers, samurai films, and “Mad Max”-style dystopias. Directed by Sion Sono, an established bad boy of Japanese cinema, it stars Nicolas Cage who, even when his character gets a testicle blown off midway through, seems comparatively tired. The movie’s ultimately less than meets the eye, but since there’s an awful lot meeting the eye here, it’s probably a wash.

Much more engaging if equally lunatic is the low-budget “Strawberry Mansion,” a day-after-tomorrow fable in which our nightly dreams are monitored, taxed, and commercialized; it’s the tale of one lonely dream-tax auditor (played by co-director Kentucker Audley) who falls down a rabbit hole of romance and conspiracy theories and human-sized mice in sailor’s pinafores. Sometimes you just have to go along for the ride.

There are, of course, more traditional Sundance genres. The rock-doc, for example: “The Sparks Brothers,” from Edgar Wright (“Baby Driver”), a fondly indulgent look back at the four-decade career of Sparks (a.k.a. Ron and Russell Mael), who in the words of one onlooker, are “the best British band to ever come out of America.”

The hot-topic drama: “Mass,” a stunningly acted four-hander about the parents of a school shooting victim sitting down in a church basement with the parents of the shooter. Taking place six years after the event, the intent of the meeting is to heal, but writer-director Fran Kranz doesn’t let them or us off that easily. How do you keep it interesting when it’s just four people talking in a room? By casting actors as fine as Martha Plimpton, Jason Isaacs, Reed Birney, and the magnificent Ann Dowd.

The classy literary adaptation: “Passing,” which turns Nella Larsen’s slim 1929 novella into a scrupulously thoughtful drama of the choices made by two old friends, Irene (Tessa Thompson), the prim upper-middle-class wife of a prosperous Harlem doctor, and Clare (Ruth Negga), so successfully passing for white that even her racist husband (Alexander Skarsgard) is fooled. Marking the directing debut of British actress Rebecca Hall — who noted during the film’s online introduction that her Chicago-born mother, singer Maria Ewing, came from a family that passed for white — the film is brilliantly performed (by Thompson especially) and somewhat over-controlled stylistically, but it certainly makes a viewer want to see what Hall does next.

Finally, the heartland working-class drama, a longtime Sundance staple represented most recently by “The Rider” (whose director Chloé Zhao is winning every award under the sun for this year’s “Nomadland”). The 2021 entry is “Jockey,” a stolidly moving account of a racetrack horse rider (Clifton Collins Jr.) nearing the finish line of his career while dealing with a young jockey (Moisés Arias) who claims to be his son.

The film, which sold to Sony Pictures Classics on the festival’s second day, is a personal matter for its first-time director, Clint Bentley, whose father was a jockey and who grew up on racetracks. If “Jockey” leans heavily on its golden-hour cinematography, the details are finely observed and Collins is tersely moving in the title role. A longtime supporting player (“Westworld”) granted a rare lead, he won a Sundance special jury award Tuesday night for best actor. If it was impossible not to miss the people on the ground at this year’s festival, the people up on the screen made up for it.

With Valentine’s Day approaching, here are some romance movies — some you might expect (”Wuthering Heights”!), some you might not (”Batman”?) — to add to the mood and let you start celebrating early.

It’s the classic date: “Let’s go to a movie.” That’s true even if by “go” you mean to a room with a plasma TV instead of a theater with a big screen. Either way, you sit next to each other in the dark, maybe hold hands (when not reaching into the same bucket of popcorn). What could be more romantic?

Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger in ""Batman."" Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images

Batman (1989) “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the film, did not work for me as a romantic feature. The very tiny part of me that wants to be wined and dined by a wealthy businessman did not respond to Jamie Dornan as the controlling and humorless Christian Grey. (It’s not Dornan’s fault; Grey just doesn’t appeal to me.) The well-to-do character I want — for two hours, onscreen, at least — is Bruce Wayne, a.k.a Batman, as played by Michael Keaton in Tim Burton’s 1989 “Batman.” What a date movie! Keaton woos Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) by complimenting her impressive work in journalism, inviting her to a beautiful dinner in his home, moving that dinner to a cozier location the second he realizes she’s uncomfortable, and, eventually, without much coaxing, deciding to trust her by letting her into his man/bat cave. Keaton’s Wayne, who manages to brood with a sense of humor, communicates with every love language in this film. Plus, he looks spectacular in that black turtleneck (swoon).

Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in ''Before Sunrise.'' Hulton Archive/Getty Images

Before Sunrise (1995) This movie hits different this year. In it, we watch two strangers — Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is American, Céline (Julie Delpy) is French — meet on a train, impulsively decide to spend the night wandering Vienna together, and fall in love in real time. Travel! Meeting new people! Wandering the world freely, experiencing whatever the night brings! Remember when? “Before Sunrise,” directed by Richard Linklater, isn’t just a pre-pandemic document. It’s a pre-cellphone time capsule — no texting other people or Googling “best place to play pinball in a grunge dive bar after midnight in Vienna.” No camera, even, for the lovers to take pictures to remember each other by. And so they (and we) live in the moments, browsing used record stores, riding trams, sitting in cafes with other people sitting in cafes, all having their own moments. When the two kiss at the top of a Ferris wheel as the sun sets, you can hear the creaking of his black leather jacket. The night is a liminal space, a bardo. It allows them to really reveal themselves. It’s not just romantic, it’s moving. The movie, too, is about time and its passage, about aging before the aging happens. It has two sequels, “Before Sunset” (2004) and “Before Midnight” (2013). I was about the age of Jesse and Céline when the first film came out. I’ve never seen the others. Maybe it’s time.

Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Sony Pictures Classics via AP

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) There’s a moment when Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) have a moment’s respite on their frantic mission to recover the Green Destiny, the ancient sword of heroes of which only Li is worthy. The vision of it has never left me: a stone hut, its broad, rectangular opening framing the lush green bamboo forest beyond. He passes her tea; their hands touch, and a lifetime of bottled-up emotion seems ready to burst. He holds her palm to his cheek, and speaks, though not as you — or she — expects: “Only when by letting go can we truly possess what is real,” he says, as her hopeful gaze crumbles back into the stoic warrior’s mask she’s worn all her life. “Not everything is an illusion,” she says. “My hand? Was that not real?” They sit quietly, hands touching but a gulf between them. Not long after Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), the renegade princess with the Green Destiny in hand, draws Li to the upper stories of the bamboo forest for one of the film’s defining battle scenes. It’s always something.

“CTHD” might not be the first to mind when thinking of romantic films, but please, let’s give it its due. It’s one of the greatest, most moving tales of unrequited love of its era, if not of all time — and with gravity-defying, lightning-fast martial arts, no less. But it’s director Ang Lee’s effortless gift toggling between them — fast, then slow — that gives the film its emotional heft. Love is always a high-wire act, equal parts panic and thrill; and the leap of faith you don’t take is the one you’ll always regret. Available on Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu, YouTube

MURRAY WHYTE

Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert in ""Far From Heaven."" David Lee/Focus Features

Far From Heaven (2002) An homage to the “women’s pictures” genre of the 1950s, “Far From Heaven” isn’t exactly a love story. It’s more of a destined-to-never-find-true-love story centered on what should be the perfect mid-century Connecticut couple. Frank and Cathy Whitaker (Dennis Quaid and Julianne Moore) live in a foliage-filled upper-middle class suburb. Just below, and eventually cracking the veneer, is Frank’s secret gay life. When it’s no longer a secret to Cathy, she falls for the Black gardener (Dennis Haysbert) who shows her the warmth that Frank did not. Because it’s the 1950s, the town turns against her, regarding Cathy as a social pariah for her relationship with the gardener. While the film’s plot is tragic, the true love here is between “Far From Heaven” director Todd Haynes and German-born director Douglas Sirk, who helmed 1950s films such as “All That Heaven Allows” (1955) and “Magnificent Obsession” (1954). There’s also a heavy debt of gratitude toward “Imitation of Life” (1959). Haynes lovingly takes his cues from these movies, down to an oversaturated palette and the melodramatic flair. Haynes’s love of these movies has served him well, particularly when he adapted Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 story “Carol,” in 2015. Available on Amazon Prime, Hulu, YouTube

Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in ""Holiday."" Courtesy of the Criterion Collection

Holiday (1938) In George Cukor’s delectable romantic comedy, Cary Grant is slated to announce his engagement to the sister of Katharine Hepburn at a swanky soirée, but it’s clear that Grant and Hepburn are made for each other. The moment of physical contact that confirms this does not occur during their slow waltz midway through the movie, intimate though that is. No, the tip-off comes earlier, when Hepburn blithely stands on Grant’s shoulders, then jumps off and executes a forward roll while Grant rolls right behind her. Acrobatic amour, in perfect synchronicity. (By the way, that was one heck of a year for Grant and Hepburn: “Bringing Up Baby” was also released in 1938.) After the inevitable impediments to these true minds, three things happen in rapid and fitting succession at the end of “Holiday”: Grant does a handstand, Grant does a backflip, and love conquers all.

Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton in ""Only Lovers Left Alive."" Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics

Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton hold down Jim Jarmusch’s ink-dark romantic dramedy as two ancient, reclusive vampires with a taste for the aesthetic, artistic, and dramatic. The slow-paced plot takes a back seat as the film illustrates the enduring love between the cynical musician Adam (Hiddleston) and the ebullient bibliophile Eve (Swinton). Lesser actors would stagger under the weight of Jarmusch’s script (crammed with more literary, historical, and musical references than you can shake a stake at) but these stars carry it all the way from the urban wilderness of Detroit to the winding alleys of Tangier, Morocco. Fellow travelers include Mia Wasikowska as Eve’s loose-cannon sister, the late and greatly missed Anton Yelchin as a puppyish fanboy, and John Hurt as Christopher Marlowe (yes, that one, and yes, he wrote Shakespeare’s plays). Perhaps no other film so seductively indulges in excessive nostalgia while warning against the dangers of lingering too long in its grasp. Eat your heart out, Edward Cullen. Watch after dark.

Patrice Donnelly, left, and Mariel Hemingway in ""Personal Best."" Warner Brothers/Getty Images

Personal Best (1982) Romance movies are big on hand-holding and kissing and (let us say) more intricate types of physical contact. Yet they rarely convey the corporeality of romance, which is different from sex. Contact isn’t required for corporeality. Even at a distance — maybe especially at a distance — romantic love quickens the pulse, raises the temperature, and brings a blush to the skin. The heart has its reasons that reason knows nothing of, and it’s the rest of the body that recognizes what’s going on. Robert Towne’s directorial debut is about aspiring Olympic athletes. The lead character (Mariel Hemingway) falls in love twice, each time with a fellow athlete: one female, one male. The relationships are rich, affecting, and plausible. But what makes “Personal Best” such a great romance movie is how utterly at ease the characters are with their own bodies. Corporeality isn’t just what they do. It’s who they are. Pauline Kael, as always acute and practical both, made this point in her New Yorker review. “Personal Best,” she wrote, “should be one of the best dating movies of all time, because it pares away all traces of self-consciousness.” Going for the gold, corporeality-wise, allows the characters to convey it, romance-wise, with unique and enchanting matter of fact-ness.

MARK FEENEY

Adèle Haenel, left, and Noémie Merlant in ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire."" Neon via AP

Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019) When it comes to romance in the movies, less is more. I don’t want to watch a lot of gratuitous rolling around in an unmade bed, or have to endure two hours of adults acting like puppies. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” gets it exactly right. French director Céline Sciamma’s exquisite film about a young woman hired to paint another young woman is tres romantique — honestly, it’s a house afire by the end — and it conjures the mood without any MMA-style clutching and grabbing. Instead, it’s all in the way Marianne, played diffidently by Noémie Merlant, looks at Héloïse, the coltish lass whose portrait she’s commissioned to paint, played by Adèle Haenel. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” is beautiful to look at in part because it’s shot like a classic painting — and the paint here dries very slowly, which makes for a fine romance.

Splendor in the Grass (1961) Has there been a movie that feels more like falling in love than Elia Kazan’s hyper-emotional saga of teen hormones and heartbreak? That swooning, tilting opening shot, with Deanie Loomis (Natalie Wood) necking in the front seat with high school beau Bud Stamper (new kid Warren Beatty), feels like it’s about to slide off the edge of reason, and Deanie herself soon follows. This is arguably Wood’s greatest performance, and it’s devastating; the movie itself is a female “Rebel Without a Cause,” and, as such, rather more dangerous.

Wings of Desire (1987) Romance is the beating heart of this Wim Wenders classic, yet not only in the traditional sense. Two angels move through the city of Berlin, hearing the unvoiced thoughts of its weary souls and attempting to console them, until one angel (Bruno Ganz) becomes enthralled by a trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin) and chooses to renounce his chaste and chilly immortality in order to experience the tactile pleasures of earthly life and love.

Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in ""Wuthering Heights."" Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images

Wuthering Heights (1939) Rom-com energy can be enjoyable, sure. There are barriers to love and happiness, and it takes our adorable couple from 90 minutes to two hours to overcome them. But tortured-love energy is a more rarefied and raw force, one that reflects the darkest and most soul-stirring facets of human nature — and the 1939 version of “Wuthering Heights” fully embodies that force. Beautifully directed by William Wyler, the film is a carefully abridged adaptation of Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel, shot in an expressionistic black-and-white that turns the Yorkshire moors into the landscape of another, less shackled emotional world. As Heathcliff, Laurence Olivier is mesmerizing, his torment and class resentment palpable throughout. He is all love, as well as its companion state, loathing. At his most handsome in that era, with faraway eyes and a dimpled chin, Olivier represents the passion that Cathy (Merle Oberon) is drawn to — but turns away from out of social cowardice. Oh, our doomed couple do indeed find a way to embrace their great love — but alas, in death. Available on Amazon Prime.

Strangers approaching Levy on the street and shouting the signature line of Alexis Rose — the sister to his character, David, in the popular television series — at him: “Ew!”

“Some good: People finally started watching our show ‘Schitt’s Creek.’ And we were fortunate enough to win nine Emmys this year,” he began. “Unbelievable. Beyond a dream come true.”

Dan Levy has had quite a year. And in his opening monologue for “Saturday Night Live” — his first time hosting the sketch comedy show — he addressed the “good” and “bad” that the past 12 months have brought him.

“But in all seriousness, for all the good and the not so good, I have somehow found myself here on this iconic stage standing in front of all of you,” Levy said. “And trust me when I say this, it has only been good here at SNL.”

Levy then brought the audience on a backstage tour to give a humorous preview of how the show is running amid a global pandemic, which involved frequent interruptions from a safety officer named Doreen (Aidy Bryant).

Between being poked by Doreen with a six-foot noodle to emphasize social distancing and having his hand swatted down when pointing to allegedly prevent droplets from spreading, Levy showed members of the cast being sprayed with antiviral mist, the blocked-off and glowing dressing room of indie-rock star Phoebe Bridgers, and even one familiar face: his own father, Eugene Levy.

Eugene Levy had flown in to wish him “luck” but because he traveled, ended up in a glass “isolation box.”

“Well, I’d offer to help, but we’re live on TV,” Dan Levy said.

Sketches throughout the show touched on the coronavirus pandemic and the upcoming Super Bowl, among other topics.

In “Super Bowl Pod,” Levy is gathered with a group of friends to watch the game despite the ongoing health crisis and warning from officials to avoid attending parties. They repeatedly assure each other that they have done “everything right” and “deserve this” — then proceed to list out activities they have kept up with like wrestling, traveling, and hanging out with friends.

“It’s so selfish. It’s so disgusting,” the group said, after admonishing those who are still engaging in social activities (like themselves.) The sketch seemed to highlight the ongoing “pandemic shaming” of individuals, but also the risks that come with ignoring public health advice.

After none of the friends can smell or taste the chili prepared by the host (played by Beck Bennett), Kate McKinnon as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, makes an appearance.

“Right now, you’re probably feeling like most Americans. Bored, horny, and borderline nuts. I know I am,” McKinnon said. “But what you just saw is the wrong way to Super Bowl.”

Meanwhile, in “Zillow,” the sketch plays up the boredom of many during the pandemic — but is mainly targeted toward those in their late 30s — by highlighting the appeal of Zillow to stave off boredom.

“You’re in your late 30s. Time for a new fantasy — on Zillow,” several cast members say during the faux commercial.

The clip features a number of adults browsing the expensive homes of others and appearing to be satisfied doing so.

“I’d never live in North Carolina, but if I did, I could buy a big, gross mansion,” Levy croons.

And the American indie-rock musician Phoebe Bridgers brought the power in her electric debut on “Saturday Night Live,” performing “Kyoto” and “I Know The End” off of her highly-acclaimed album “Punisher.”

The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter donned her classic skeleton suit during “Kyoto” and at the end of her performance of “I Know The End” — which featured her belting out screams — smashed her electric guitar, sending sparks flying as trumpets blared in the background.

“Hello and welcome to the Super Bowl, four hours of television for 11 minutes of action,” said Kenan Thompson, introducing himself as sports broadcaster “James, no not that one, Brown.”

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off against the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday, in what will mark quarterback Tom Brady’s 10th Super Bowl. As a preview for what’s to come, “Saturday Night Live” opened the show with a mock sports broadcast that ridiculed the efforts of advertisers to present themselves as socially conscious and tackled current issues dividing the nation.

“As everyone at home knows, this year has been anything but normal,” Thompson said. “The pandemic, racial and political divisions, Armie Hammer. But today we come together in a spirit of unity to watch football and murder millions of chickens for their delicious wings.”

The parody of “NFL Today” poked fun at the NFL’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and also to be more inclusive — following a rocky past in how the league handled protests calling for racial justice and an end to police brutality — this season.

“The league also dealt with so many COVID restrictions this year. But with hard work and vigilance, we were able to get through the season with only 700 cases,” Thompson said. “Hooray us.”

The show also didn’t hesitate to joke about the difference in age between Buccs quarterback Brady, who is 43 years old, and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is 25 years old.

“The game is also being simulcast on the Bravo network, where it’s hosted by Andy Cohen,” Day said. “And instead of the Super Bowl, it’s called ‘Old Hag vs. Young Slut.’”

The crew then presented a number of mock commercials that would air during the Big Game, playing up the efforts of advertisers to seize on “the importance of this moment in history” with “impassioned commercials” — a ploy, the show seemed to suggest, aimed at generating a large profit.

One such commercial was for Papa John’s, which has been embroiled in scandal itself, that appeared to be an ad for QAnon, the viral pro-Trump conspiracy theory, while another from Budweiser touched on the pandemic and encouraged viewers to get their “second dose” — “of cold refreshing Bud Light,” that is.

But the highlight of the sketch was the appearance of Aidy Bryant, who played both Chiefs coach Andy Reid and Buccs coach Bruce Arians.

“Speaking of both sides, let’s talk to both of these incredible coaches about how they’re preparing for the big game,” Thompson said.

Bryant made a quick costume change as she alternated between the two coaches — including the addition of a pair of glasses for Arians — and revealed the strategy for how each would be approaching the game (which turned out to be quite similar).

“Well, we’re gonna run it first, then pass it, and then when they have the ball, we’re gonna try to take the ball back,” Bryant said.

It’s a love song, explains Chad, played by a young actor named Elvis Presley. (The film, from 1961, is “Blue Hawaii.”) Love songs, Chad says, “are the same in any language.”

“Chad” has just returned to his native Hawaii from a stint in the Army. Having been stationed in Europe, he’s brought back a gift for his girlfriend and her grandmother. It’s a music box that plays the 18th-century French ballad “Plaisir d’amour.”

That’s the song my in-laws chose when I asked them what was “their” song. They know it from Elvis, but it goes back more than 200 years.

Love songs are eternal. Love has been a dominant theme of popular song “for at least a thousand years,” as Ted Gioia writes in his book “Love Songs: The Hidden History” (2015). In fact, love may well be the reason we as a species began singing in the first place.

Yet to the cynical among us, modern-day love songs are hopelessly schlocky. They’re “soft.” To sing a love song is to expose your emotions — your vulnerability — often with excessive melodrama.

Take, for instance, Diana Ross and Lionel Richie’s “Endless Love” (1981). It captured the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s list of the Top 50 Love Songs of All Time a few years ago, beating out “How Deep Is Your Love,” “My Love,” and other audio Valentines of the FM radio heyday.

Songs like “Endless Love,” we sometimes think, are more enjoyable with tongue firmly planted in cheek than in a significant other’s mouth. But as Gioia argues, the love song is our “toughest and most battle-hardened mode of artistic expression.”

Advertisement

Think about it: How many times in the course of human culture has a new kind of love song encountered disapproval, suppression, sometimes even violence? (To be clear, when a song is about love, the subtweet is usually sex.)

The tango and the waltz were both condemned in their day for inciting dangerous liaisons, just as pop hits from swing to Rihanna have been in more recent times. So the history of the love song is actually a history of outcasts and interlopers, Gioia claims.

In that spirit, we asked some of our favorite outcasts and interlopers — modern lovers all — which love song they wish they’d written, and why.

Lori McKenna, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter

Tom Petty’s “Wildflowers” is the absolute perfect expression of selfless and unconditional love. Stops me in my tracks whenever I hear this song. The simplicity of the lyrics over that gorgeous melody, and how one isn’t lost to the other, is brilliant.

Fred Hersch, renowned jazz pianist and former New England Conservatory faculty

I would wager that 50 percent of all songs are about love in some form, so hard to choose! But my pick is Nat King Cole’s version of Irving Berlin’s “How Deep Is the Ocean.” The gist of the lyric is that “there is nothing in the whole of nature that adequately expresses how I feel for you.” Most jazz interpretations are done as in a medium swing groove in C minor, but I play it as a very slow ballad in Eb minor and sing the words in my head as I render the melody.

Anais Mitchell, singer-songwriter and Tony Award-winning creator of “Hadestown”

“Something in the Way She Moves,” by James Taylor. I sing this song to my kids pretty much every night. It’s just a magical song, an ode to someone who makes you a better version of yourself. I love the line when he’s speaking about her sort of talking him down, and he goes, “To me the words are nice, the way they sound.” Also, it has the most perfect mysterious bridge ever.

Anjimile, Boston singer-songwriter whose “Giver Taker” was named one of NPR’s 50 Best Albums of 2020

I’m gonna say “What’s Love Got to Do With It” by Tina Turner. The lyrics are simple, straightforward, and devastating. And the music is both tense and oddly comforting. It’s sad and sexy. Great song.

Ralph Tavares, eldest brother of the family band Tavares

“Lovin’ You” by Minnie Riperton. When Tavares was recording in L.A. in the mid-’70s, we became friendly with her. She was carrying this tune around, humming it a lot. Eventually it became what it became. It was co-produced by Stevie Wonder. I always loved that song.

Billie Holiday Decca Jazz

Ryan Montbleau, singer-songwriter and guitarist

The one that comes to mind is “Crazy He Calls Me.” It was most famously sung by Billie Holiday but has also been recorded as “Crazy She Calls Me,” which is how I would have sung it. It’s got it all — incredible melody, self-reflection and humor in the lyrics, and yet it never loses the sentiment of strong love. “Like the wind that shakes the bough, (s)he moves me with a smile. The difficult I’ll do right now, the impossible will take a little while.”

Prateek Poddar, Boston Music Awards singer-songwriter nominee

There’s about a million love songs I wish I’d written, but at this moment, my current obsession is “Speak Plainly Diana” by Joe Pug. It’s a brilliant ode to fleeting relationships with a catchy chorus that I can’t wait to scream when in-person concerts finally come back.

Paul Simon Evan Agostini

Rachael Price, lead singer of Lake Street Dive

I wish I had written “I Do It for Your Love” by Paul Simon. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. It perfectly and painfully illuminates the highs and lows of a relationship. It is as much a stunning painting of a beautiful scene as it is a perfect song.

Barrence Whitfield, frontman of Barrence Whitfield and the Savages

One I wish I wrote is sung by soul singer Otis Clay. It’s called “That’s How It Is (When You’re in Love).” It’s about a guy so deeply in love with this woman who is abusing him that he can’t help himself. The opening of the song starts out, “Please somebody, take your hand, and slap some sense in me.” Now, if that isn’t deep love, I don’t know what is.

Directed by James Darrah and featuring charcoal hand-drawn images and stop-motion animation, this “Usher” has some uneven aspects, but overall, in its boldly inventive treatment of Glass’s opera realized by a creative team working under unprecedented conditions, the film is an impressive achievement.

When the pandemic hit, rather than just closing up shop for the season or creating a pale digital imitation of its traditional offerings, Boston Lyric Opera approached the disruption as an opportunity to throw out older scripts. Theaters are closed (and BLO didn’t have a permanent venue anyway) — why not build an opera truck to take the music where it wants to go? Check . Can’t gather for live performance at a time when we’re all living on screens — how about taking a previously scheduled opera and producing it as a streamable arthouse film? Check . Overall, in its creativity and resilience at a time of crisis, BLO has been setting the bar for the city’s midsize arts organizations.

BLO had previously found success in its mounting of another Glass chamber opera, “In the Penal Colony,” after the singularly unsettling story by Kafka. Something fundamental in Glass’s idiom — that sense of forced stasis within the endless churning of note; those contrasting stabs of Romantic longing set against an impassive, relentless, almost mechanized backdrop — makes it just right for stories told in the key of existential dread.

This of course also applies to Glass’s “Usher” score, the recording of which was assembled here under the supervision of music director David Angus using individual layers created with the help of a click track, as per the new COVID-era norm. Despite these challenging conditions, the questing subjectivity in the composer’s writing for Roderick Usher (here an ardent Jesse Darden) and his old friend William (Daniel Belcher, singing with excellent clarity) comes through vividly, while at the same time feeling almost entombed within the music’s overlay of burbling detachment. What’s more, an additional feature of Glass’s own conception seems to only emphasize the point: in Arthur Yorinks’s rather minimalist libretto, the character of Roderick’s twin sister, Madeline, has been reduced to speechlessness, her crumbling world rendered in wordless vocalizations of distilled yearning (forcefully sung by Chelsea Basler).

Where this “Usher” goes its own way is in, well, just about every aspect beyond the music. In a treatment conceived by screenwriter Raúl Santos, the opera’s action here plays out in the mind of a migrant Guatemalan girl named Luna who is trapped in a detention center at the US-Mexico border. Luna’s journey and her captivity are rendered in charcoal animation which, at its best, has an affecting visual poetry about it, one that finds sympathetic echo in the music. While captive, Luna eventually finds a doll house within which she imagines Poe’s chilling story taking place. The Poe narrative is depicted with its own visual language — stop-motion animation — as a kind of nightmare within a nightmare.

Those thematic elements alone, deployed with the right balance of rigor and fantasy, might well have sufficed to produce an opera film of visual interest and contemporary political resonance. On top of these layers, however, Darrah and his team have added another gloss about television itself, interweaving a vast array of archival footage that is meant as a comment on how television mediates our views of America and those of the world at large — and how the medium’s own footage can also be turned against itself to reveal the curdling of the great American Dream.

Fair enough, in theory, and at times the references in the footage are tightly on point, capturing for instance the actual caging of migrant children. But too often there is a kitchen-sink quality to what’s included: images from old horror films, crowd scenes with parades, funerals, animal experiments, shock treatments, African drumming, the mass production of children’s dolls, enormous flocks of birds, and mushroom clouds from nuclear explosions. For this viewer, the unrestrained piling on ended up blunting the sharpness of the film’s otherwise powerful critique embedded in the Luna story.

This thought-provoking “Usher” is at its considerable best in the strangely captivating visual simplicity of the charcoal drawings, and in the oddly unsettling world of the wooden figurines, which we watch at times as they are eerily manipulated by human hands. And behind it all, Glass’s endlessly pulsating score heightens the subliminal resonance, hinting at the broader worlds of pain and longing that we know are churning in real life, just beyond the edges of our screen.

Now they want to see the president step up.,[''],en,2/4/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"Even before he was inaugurated, Trump got into a Twitter spat with the cast of “Hamilton,” and for the ensuing four years the relationship between the former president and the cultural sector was defined by mutual antipathy.

He may have titled his 1987 book “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” but there was never much evidence that Donald Trump valued the arts during his presidency, except as a convenient punching bag.

Trump repeatedly tried to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and routinely skipped the Kennedy Center Honors. Of the two dozen recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his presidency, only one was a cultural figure: Elvis Presley, who is long dead (though there’s some dispute about that).

Now, after an inaugural day and night that amply showcased singers, actors, and a young poet, Joe Biden has assumed the presidency amid a desperate fight by arts organizations to survive the financial crisis brought on by the pandemic. What could it mean in this perilous moment to have someone in the Oval Office who views culture as essential and takes steps to address the specific nature of the challenges faced by the performing arts?

The short answer is: potentially everything.

“This is the real shift between Biden and Trump,” said Harvey Young, dean of the College of Fine Arts at Boston University and a prominent cultural historian. “What I anticipate we’ll see is a celebration of the importance and the power of the arts. I imagine it will go back to the way that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama welcomed the arts into the White House, to show it is the arts that defines who we are.”

Young admits, though, that it’s not 100 percent clear how deep Biden’s commitment to the arts goes. The depth of that commitment will be revealed in whether or not the new president takes concrete steps to aid in the recovery of the pandemic-battered cultural sector. One vital step, Young said, would be forgiveness of the federal Paycheck Protection Program loans to arts organizations, which would “allow them to survive.” Courtney O’Connor, artistic director of Lyric Stage Company of Boston, which received funds during the first round of PPP loans, agreed that loan forgiveness “would be so tremendously helpful” to theaters and other performing arts institutions that have been shuttered for nearly a year.

“The biggest challenge the arts are facing is the fact that their doors are closed,” said BU’s Young. “As vaccines roll out, there needs to be a strategy to reopen and reestablish the live performing arts. The biggest mistake the Biden administration could make would be delaying too long the reopening of arts organizations.”

While Young says he expects Biden to increase the budgets of the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities — a task that should be easier with Democratic control of both houses of Congress — he also hopes Biden will “follow the Marty Walsh playbook and appoint a Cabinet-level arts leader.” The Boston mayor, who is Biden’s pick for US labor secretary, elevated the position of arts and culture leader early in his tenure. Accelerated by the current crisis, sentiment has been building recently in the cultural sector nationwide for the creation of a similarly high-powered post in the federal government.

“On a practical level, Biden, unlike Trump, will ensure the health of the NEA as opposed to trying to eliminate it,” said Robert J. Orchard, founder of Boston’s ArtsEmerson. “He talks about wanting to restore the soul of the country. I’d like to see arts, culture, and creativity rise to a Cabinet level. We need to encourage an active civic dialogue, and the arts can play a central role in that.”

To Lyric Stage’s O’Connor, a leader with a portfolio dedicated to culture is especially vital now, when Biden is juggling so many public-health and economic issues. “I can’t imagine everything that he is looking at every day, trying to get this pandemic under control and get things back open,” she said. “My fear is the arts will be forgotten.” Even measures not directly targeted at the arts, such as making health care more accessible and housing more affordable, would make a big difference in the lives of theater workers, she said.

Pressure is building on the Biden administration to move quickly to provide relief to the embattled arts sector. In a column that ran in the Guardian a few days after the inauguration beneath the headline “American theater may not survive the coronavirus. We need help now,” playwright Jeremy O. Harris (”Slave Play”) called for a national program modeled on the New Deal-era Federal Theatre Project.

Operating as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration from 1935-39, the relief project created jobs for thousands of unemployed theater professionals by funding productions, of dramas, musicals, puppet shows, and children’s plays across the country. The productions were often free, so there was a benefit to cash-strapped audiences as well as actors, designers, and technicians. A present-day version of the Federal Theatre Project could help reduce the “economic barrier” of high ticket prices that make theater “often sadly out of reach for many Americans,” Harris wrote.

He also called for greater economic assistance to arts workers and organizations, noting that while the German government has stepped up with an aid package of billions of dollars for the cultural sector, in the United States “most initiatives to help struggling arts professionals have been ad hoc and privately led. . . . We shouldn’t have to GoFundMe an entire industry, yet we are.”

Beyond such tangible measures is the message a president — or, often, a first lady — can send to the public about how much the arts matter: as an intrinsically enriching activity, as a means of building community, as an emblem of our shared values.

During Obama’s presidency, first lady Michelle Obama saw numerous shows on Broadway, sometimes accompanied by her husband, sometimes by their daughters, underscoring the importance of theater in the development of young people. “If I’m giving those experiences to Malia and Sasha, and I think it’s important to them, then I can’t pretend it’s not important for everyone,” she said.

The Obamas made sure to include musicals and plays created by or starring Black artists: They saw a performance of August Wilson’s “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone” (boosting subsequent ticket sales) and a revival of “A Raisin in the Sun” starring Denzel Washington. Michelle Obama attended the New York production of “The Gershwins’ Porgy & Bess” by Cambridge’s American Repertory Theater, and afterward thanked Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis, and the rest of the cast for “blessing my soul.”

“The fact that President Obama and Michelle Obama made a point of going to the theater, it was saying that a well-lived life requires that one goes out, visits museums, attends the theater, buys a ticket to concerts,” said Young. “That’s what a president can do.”

Of course, manifesting a fondness for the arts can also be an exercise in presidential image-polishing, a way to bask in the reflected glow of culture. John F. Kennedy’s interest in the arts was fairly limited, but public perceptions of his presidency as a bastion of culture were bolstered by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who had a genuine passion for music and ballet. She threw open the White House to performing artists like cellist Pablo Casals and violinist Isaac Stern, and after JFK was assassinated, the young widow turned to a Broadway musical, “Camelot,” as a metaphor for his presidency, thus enshrining JFK’s three short years in the White House within the mythic aura of “one brief shining moment.”

“Cool” was certainly not the first word the average voter would have used to describe Jimmy Carter in 1976, but Carter upped his coolness quotient by referring to Bob Dylan’s “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” when accepting the Democratic nomination. Aretha Franklin and Paul Simon performed at a concert for his inauguration, and Carter had such strong personal connections to Dylan, Willie Nelson, and the Allman Brothers, among others, that a recent documentary was titled “Jimmy Carter: Rock and Roll President.”

When it comes to the very different relationships the last two presidents had with the arts, “Hamilton” alone can pretty much tell the tale.

On May 12, 2009, with a clearly delighted President Obama and Michelle Obama in the audience, a young Lin-Manuel Miranda debuted what would become the opening number from his still-in-development musical at a White House Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word.

Fast-forward seven years, to Nov. 18, 2016. “Hamilton” had become the biggest sensation on Broadway in a generation, Trump had just been elected president, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence decided to take in a performance of Miranda’s musical. When it ended, a cast member delivered a heartfelt appeal from the stage to Pence, saying that “we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us,” adding “we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.”

Trump immediately and furiously weighed in on Twitter, declaring that the “Hamilton” cast had “harassed” Pence and had been “very rude.” Demanded the President-elect: “Apologize!”

And on that rancorous note was established the prevailing tone of the next four years. With a new president in the Oval Office, many in the arts world are looking forward to more harmony — and more help recovering from the devastation wrought by the pandemic.

“Anything an American president does sends a signal,” said Orchard. “We’ve just been through a series of signals that are the most depressing in our history. Coming out of this fraught period, we need beauty and we need community — and the arts provide both. And that’s going to need support.”

For one thing, Lear surrendered his power willingly (if unwisely). For another, the ex-ruler in Shakespeare’s monumental tragedy eventually expresses contrition for his lack of compassion — a decidedly un-Trumpian gesture. And Trump’s powers of language are, um, somewhat short of Shakespearean.

It would be facile to draw too many parallels between the title figure in “King Lear” and former president Donald J. Trump.

“Look at the Trump administration, all the backstabbing and betrayals and the throwing under the bus,” says O’Hare in an interview from his home in Paris. “And look at what he did. He ruined every single person who came out of his administration. He ruined John Bolton — an awful human being, but I got a twinge of pity even for him. They were awful people . . . but they all got ruined by him. That’s part of this play.”

In “King Lear,” Lear’s actions trigger a deadly round of power grabs and double-crosses by a malevolent trio that includes two of his daughters, Goneril and Regan, along with Edmund, son of the Earl of Gloucester. The king’s egotism and narcissistic self-absorption spawn chaos and result in enormous suffering to the people in his orbit, especially Cordelia, the only one of Lear’s daughters who genuinely loves him, and Gloucester, who pays an unspeakable price for his loyalty to the monarch.

“There’s no cognate in the Trump administration for Cordelia,” says O’Hare. “I don’t know who that would be. She’s the one innocent person who doesn’t deserve any of this, and she gets chewed up and spit out as well.”

Advertisement

“It’s always great for Shakespeare to be able to be put in modern dress, because then you invite people to make modern comparisons,” he adds. “You don’t need to push it too heavily, because you’re never going to get a one-on-one correspondence. So in the Trump administration, who are the [equivalent of Lear’s] three daughters? You could say it’s Ivanka and Don Jr. and — what’s the other one? — Eric. But it doesn’t really scan because they’re all evil. There’s no good one.”

O’Hare is a protean performer who has left an indelible stamp on roles that in recent years have included Jessie, an ex-addict and former lover of William, on NBC’s “This Is Us”; quirky, ultraliberal Judge Charles Abernathy on CBS’s “The Good Fight” and “The Good Wife”; vampire king Russell Edgington on HBO’s “True Blood”; and characters in FX’s “American Horror Story” who have included a man greatly disfigured by burns, a con artist, a mute butler, and a transgender bartender named Liz Taylor.

Onstage, O’Hare won a 2003 Tony Award for his portrayal of a solitary money manager in Richard Greenberg’s “Take Me Out.” In 2013, he delivered a mesmerizing solo performance at Boston’s Paramount Center of “An Iliad,” an adaptation of Homer’s epic poem by him and Lisa Peterson. Two years ago he starred as “Tartuffe” at London’s National Theatre. (”I would never do ‘Tartuffe’ in Paris,” O’Hare says wryly. “I’d be torn to pieces. I’m not French, and it’s Moliere.”)

O’Hare has played the title roles in “Richard III” and “Macbeth” (”I would never do that again,” he says of portraying the Scottish king. “It was miserable.”), and he still glows at the memory of playing Mercutio in “Romeo and Juliet.” But one Shakespearean role O’Hare has never played is ... King Lear.

“I’m too young to play Lear,” the 59-year-old actor contends, though he adds that “as Blair Brown, my friend, points out, the actor who played it in Shakespeare’s company was 46.” O’Hare has seen the powerful 1970 film version of “King Lear” starring Paul Scofield and the 1983 TV-movie portrayal by Laurence Olivier, and he also saw Anthony Hopkins perform it in the mid-1980s at the National Theatre. When he is considering taking a role, O’Hare tries to avoid watching interpretations by other actors. “For me, I have to own a part,” he says. “I want to own it completely.”

O’Hare says that what intrigues him about Lear is that the king is “not a sympathetic hero.” Indeed, in his view, Lear is “an [expletive]” who “totally deserves what happens to him in many ways.”

“I don’t like those big noble characters. I would never play Henry IV,” says O’Hare, who once turned down an offer to play Hamlet. “Lear attracts me more because he is so flawed, is such an angry character. Part of the joy of discovery is trying to figure out the many different flavors and the evolution of his rage. He goes from a place of incredible power to a place of incredible weakness. In the process of becoming weak, he sees himself more clearly, and sees the world more clearly.”

On Feb. 6, O’Hare plans to perform two excerpts from “King Lear”: the scene when a storm-battered Lear realizes that as a ruler he was oblivious to the suffering of the poor and homeless (“O, I have ta’en too little care of this!” he laments) and another moment of self-awareness when the outcast king encounters the blinded Gloucester (“They told me I was everything,” says Lear. “‘Tis a lie . . .”

Speaking of self-awareness: As he talks about the multidimensional monarch he’ll be exploring on Feb. 6, O’Hare pauses for an acknowledgement of something that is already apparent to his interlocutor. “Now, of course, it will get into my DNA and I’m sure I will play it at some point,” he says.

In the program introduction, Boston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen calls Yakobson a “monumental choreographer” who “transformed the art form,” and though Boston Ballet last presented Yakobson’s work in 2019, it’s still a treat to watch these pieces again. The hourlong program is rounded out with Nissinen’s reflections on touring and then a quick preview of a new work, “Zoom In,” by former Nederlands Dans Theater dancer Ken Ossola that Boston Ballet will present in April in the final virtual program of the season.

Born in 1904, the same year as George Balanchine, Yakobson, unlike Mr. B, remained in the Soviet Union, a Jewish avant-garde choreographer in constant conflict with party officials. Boston Ballet performed his “Pas de Quatre” in March 2016 and then reprised that piece in May and June 2019 along with selections from Yakobson’s “Rodin” and the seven-minute solo, “Vestris,” that he created for Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1969.

The inspiration for “Vestris” was Auguste Vestris (1760–1842), an étoile in the Paris Opera Ballet for 36 years. Clad in a Baroque jacket and breeches and wearing a powdered wig, company principal Derek Dunn makes his way through “An Old Man Dancing the Minuet,” “The Coquette Dance,” “The Preacher-Prophet,” “Classical Dance Variations,” “Prayer,” “Laughter,” and “Dying Man.” Dunn is contained, but the variety is there, and so, in the “Classical Dance Variations,” is the quality of execution.

The original “Pas de Quatre” was Jules Perrot’s 1845 salute to the four greatest ballerinas of his time: Lucile Grahn, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Marie Taglioni. Perrot’s choreography has not survived; Yakobson’s 1971 re-creation retains the Romantic tulle tutus but draws on Vincenzo Bellini’s 1831 opera “Norma” for most of the music. Dancing the opening section to “Casta diva,” Yakobson’s ballerinas might be Bellini’s Druidic priestesses as they hold hands and wreath arms, moving like a single organism. The four solos that follow, delicate hops and jumps and beats, with airy port de bras, have to be light but also precise. The 2019 cast shown here — Maria Baranova, Ji Young Chae, Nina Matiashvili, and Ekaterine Chubinidze — is a fine one; the solos from Baranova and Chae are especially beautiful.

The initial 1958 version of “Rodin” was a triptych of miniatures set to Debussy, Yakobson breathing life into the French sculptor’s “The Eternal Spring,” “The Kiss,” and “The Eternal Idol.” Overtly sexual, “Rodin” was labeled pornographic by Soviet authorities, who made the dancers don Grecian tunics over their flesh-hued unitards. The performance shown here was filmed at Jacob’s Pillow in August 2019, and though the dancers sport the original unitards, the choreography has lost most of its shock value. Abigail Merlis and Sun Woo Lee are spontaneous and teasing in “The Eternal Spring,” which I think is the best of the three pieces. María Álvarez and Alec Roberts in “The Kiss” and Emily Entingh and Michael Ryan in “The Eternal Idol” have a harder time making Yakobson look transformative.

The next segment of the program takes the form of a conversation between Nissinen and Boston Ballet principal Lia Cirio in which they reminisce about the company’s tours to Helsinki (2012), London (2013), New York (2014), and Paris (2019). Nissinen argues that touring is important for “external validation” and that a company with the quality and repertoire of Boston Ballet deserves to be seen abroad; it’s hard to disagree. The visual highlight here is the siciliana from “Bella Figura” (which the company took to London and New York), nine bare-chested men and women in long puffy red skirts swaying sinuously without the least hint of prurience. Boston Ballet had planned to reprise “Bella Figura” in May 2020; I hope the company will be able to present it again soon.

“Look Back, Focus Forward” concludes with Ossola, in Amsterdam, explaining how he’s able to set a new work via Zoom on dancers in five different studios. Ossola himself is not new to Boston Ballet, having staged “Bella Figura” for the company on multiple occasions. We don’t learn much about his piece, apart from the clever title, but it’s reassuring to see dance being created even in these difficult times.

This year, Andy already has ordered the flowers, but he and Ricky are planning a romantic evening where they have been for most of the past year: at home.

“If Valentine’s Day fell midweek, I sometimes would forget about it,” admitted Ricky, who is dean of curriculum, instruction, and student engagement at the High School Learning Center in Lawrence. “I remember coming home, finding he bought me flowers, and realizing it was Valentine’s Day.”

Before the pandemic struck last spring, Rikelma “Ricky” and Andres “Andy” Vargas, both 27 and living in Haverhill, had to coordinate demanding work schedules to spend time together on Feb. 14.

“Since the pandemic, togetherness has taken on a whole new meaning. We both have been working from home for most of the time since March,” said Andy, who is state representative for the Third Essex District. “Being together 24/7 has been surprisingly great. Recently we added a puppy named Merengue to our family.”

Valentine’s Day may be more subdued this year, but with a little creativity, couples are finding ways to make it more romantic than ever.

“In past years, I would buy my wife tickets to a play or concert and take her out to a nice restaurant for dinner,” recalled Andrew Orel, 61, of Mansfield. “Well that’s not possible this year, but I have a few surprises in mind.”

Orel, a retired mailman, and his, wife Lori, have been a couple for 35 years and married for 32 years. A self-proclaimed “romantic,” Orel took the pandemic-mandated limitations of this year as inspiration to be creative.

Lori still works part time and Andrew has been busy preparing for their Valentine’s celebration when she is at work.

“Without the Patriots in the playoffs, I have had more time to plan for the holiday,” said the Gillette Stadium season-ticket holder. “I am making her a Valentine’s Day card this year. It may not be as professional as the ones from the store, but it will be very personal, colorful, and include candy.”

Orel also has a holiday-themed dinner planned for Lori.

“I am making her a heart-shape’s Valentine’s Day pizza from scratch, with my own sauce and dough,” he explained. “I don’t have any cows, so I can’t make my own cheese.”

To complete his holiday plan, Orel has purchased a small gift and will create a bouquet of greens out of what he can forage in the woods near their home.

This year he is making her a heart-shaped pizza and a Valentine’s Day card that will be “very personal, colorful, and include candy.” David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

Valentine’s Day will be a romantic and family occasion for Breda Shernan, 67, and Howard “Howie” Levine, 79, of Natick. Parents of five and grandparents of eight, they met in 1993 and married in 1998. Both had been married before.

“We know each other so well,” said Levine. “Our relationship is based on trust.”

“Howie is my best friend,” proclaimed Shernan. “One of our favorite things is to just sit and read side by side.”

Levine knows that his wife does not like surprises, so he has ordered long-stem red roses for her, as he has for the last 20-plus Valentine’s Days.

Both have faced serious health problems, putting them at greater risk from COVID-19 complications.

“Normally, we go away for a vacation, go to the theater, and we enjoy antiquing together,” said Levine. “This year we haven’t gone anywhere.”

An unexpected bonus of the pandemic has been that their daughter, Ali Monchick, and her 21-month-old daughter Sydney have been living with them. Monchick, a California music professor, was on a sabbatical and traveling between the East Coast and Europe when the pandemic hit. She went to her parents’ home with plans to return to the West Coast in July 2020. However, once her university switched to teaching remotely, it made more sense for her and Sydney to remain in Natick.

“Sydney has enriched our lives, even as our day-to-day lives have changed,” said Levine.

“She adores her zayde [grandfather],” added Shernan.

The couple will spend the first part of Valentine’s Day baking and decorating holiday cupcakes with Sydney. In the afternoon, the two will take a road trip.

“Our favorite place is Woodman’s in Essex,” said Shernan. “We will order takeout and eat in our car. If I am sitting next to Howie, eating onion rings, and gazing out at the ocean, everything else in the world won’t matter.”

At their home in Haverhill, Ricky and Andy Vargas have developed a routine during the pandemic where they share meals while balancing multiple and sometimes dueling Zoom meetings throughout the day.

Most days, Ricky makes lunch and Andy makes dinner, but for Valentine’s Day the couple will order takeout from a favorite restaurant: Keon’s Bistro in downtown Haverhill.

“Due to COVID-19, there’s an urgent need to support our local business,” said Andy. “We will walk over to Keon’s and pick up lamb lollipop chops, filet mignon, and cider-glazed pork chops.”

“We may head to Petco for a Valentine’s Day treat for Merengue,” added Andy. “Otherwise, it will just be extra snuggles and treats.”

After dinner, Andy said, the couple — and likely Merengue — plan to spend a quiet evening “getting cozy on the couch and streaming the movie ‘One Night in Miami.’”

As district attorney of Essex County, I strongly support a legislative proposal by Governor Charlie Baker aimed at protecting the public from the most dangerous offenders. The proposal expands the offenses for which a hearing could be sought to consider if a defendant’s release on bail would endanger victims and the community. Recent case law has narrowed the statute, thus limiting the ability of prosecutors to ask that judges consider a defendant’s background and potential lethality. The proposed changes would enable judges to consider what the Legislature intended when the statute was originally passed. While the legislation was not adopted last session, I am hopeful it is reintroduced and wins approval this session.

Inconceivably, the law no longer allows prosecutors to seek a dangerousness hearing on offenses such as rape of a child (statutory rape), indecent assault and battery on a child, human trafficking, and certain cases involving use of bomb-making materials. In 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cited its observation in a prior case that “a surprising percentage of crimes are committed by persons awaiting trial,” bolstering the need to revise the statute. Moreover, the Commonwealth cannot request detention based on a defendant’s convictions for violent and sexual offenses, even though the same offenses deem a defendant a sexually dangerous person.

Judges often lament that their hands are tied and they must release dangerous defendants because of statutory loopholes and a lack of information. Expanding the dangerousness statute would allow judges to be given more information about a defendant’s background and history prior to making determinations on release, conditions, or detention. Defendants would retain the right to a bail review in superior court, in which a judge must find by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is too dangerous to release.

Passage of Governor Baker’s proposed legislation is crucial to remedying the unintended consequences of the current law. Protecting the public from those who are dangerous is a critical government function. This is not controversial. It is common sense.

In 2018 Massachusetts enacted a major criminal justice reform package that emphasized diversion and rehabilitation over the broken and ineffective system of mass incarceration. Now, less than three years later, there is a push to undo the progress being made and dramatically increase the number of people in jail awaiting trial.

Expanding the reach of so-called dangerousness hearings is wrongheaded and erodes the all-important presumption of innocence by putting more people behind bars before they have had a fair trial. Massachusetts has had some of the lowest crime rates and incarceration rates in the United States. The ultimate goal of criminal justice reform should be reducing incarceration and investing in community resources - aspirations that will reduce crime and increase public safety.

It may seem counterintuitive, but reducing the number of people in jail awaiting trial can actually lead to safer communities. Incarceration during the pretrial period can have disastrous impacts on a person’s life. Even a few days in jail can seriously disrupt a person’s family, housing, employment, and health. People who spend time in jail often lose their jobs and then their housing because they are not able to pay the rent. Students miss classes, and parents lose custody of their children. High levels of incarceration break down the social and family supports that guide individuals away from crime, devastate communities, and engender a deep mistrust toward the legal system. Studies have shown that people with substance use disorder incarcerated for even short amounts of time have a much higher rate of overdose after release.

There is also no doubt that locking people up before trial has a disproportionate effect on communities of color. We are having a national conversation about the criminal legal system and race. Pushing legislation that will only lead to more minorities being placed behind bars kneecaps the positive trajectory of the moment.

We need to give the Criminal Justice Reform Act time to work. Prosecutors already have the tools they need to hold dangerous individuals before they’ve had a chance to respond to the allegations against them. Expanding that power is a brute-force answer that will only cause more problems.

Remember vacations? Lying around reading something compelling? We were both reading “The Couple Next Door,” sipping some sugary drink and thinking about nothing except how great the sun felt and what we were going to eat next. This is exactly what Judy and I were doing — reading and drinking and talking — when the conversation turned to her “reading chair” and how much she loved it. “You need to get one,” she told me.

The chair was Judy Taylor’s idea. She has one in her bedroom, a big, comfortable chair. It’s where every day she sits for a little while and reads.

From her favorite reading chair, columnist Beverly Beckham can see this painting by artist Willa Aylaian that she bought in Carmel, Calif.

When I got home, I thought about her advice but I didn’t take it. I continued to read wherever I was. At the kitchen table. In the living room. Tucked away in the corner of the family room couch. I was fine reading wherever I landed. I didn’t need a special space.

But then my daughter decided to redo her living room and she had a sage green chair and ottoman she no longer wanted. “This is perfect for your bedroom,” she said. I wasn’t sure. My bedroom is all windows and open space. The chair was big and imposing. My son-in-law brought it over and carried it upstairs. My husband liked it. But I looked at it and still wasn’t sure.

And then came the pandemic.

Before it, I hardly sat in that chair. But now it’s where I go not just to read, but to think, to listen to music, to watch old movie clips on YouTube, to look out at the world. And to escape the world.

Last March and April and May when we were all shut inside and staying home and staying apart, when this altered way of life still felt temporary, I sat in the sage green chair and watched the skinny limbs of trees grow fat with buds, which birthed a green-gold lace, which then became leaves that were thin and pale and translucent, which then became leaves that were so deep a green and so abundant that they transformed my ordinary backyard into a sanctuary. I could no longer see the houses behind me or the house beside me. I could see nothing but grass and trees and sky.

With all that was missing from life, there was this. And for many days this was enough, the beauty I witnessed from my chair.

And then came summer and with it the freedom of being with friends outside, of sharing meals on the deck, at separate tables, yes, but that was OK, and the sage green chair wasn’t exactly ignored — when I hurt my back, it was revered — but sometimes I missed a day or two of sitting and observing.

Come October and we were still outside, space heaters on, wearing layers, still social distancing.

And then came November. I sat in the green chair and watched the leaves fall. They drifted. They danced. Their falling was beautiful. Spectacular. But after? With the trees bare? With the backyard exposed?

I saw the neighbors’ houses. I saw the rust of dead leaves. I saw the long, dark days ahead.

Now it is February and I suppose, if I looked hard enough, I could find beauty outside my window. But I’m tired of looking for silver linings. I want to open my eyes and not have to look. I just want to see.

And so I have festooned my bedroom with things that make me happy. Pussy willows in a vase. Sea glass in jars. A photo of an inn in Maine. (A photo of Bobby Orr scoring the winning goal in the 1970 Stanley Cup series because it’s my husband’s bedroom, too.) A painting of my Aunt Lorraine’s. A painting of flowers I bought in Carmel. A pillow my friend Maureen had made showcasing pictures of flowers I grew in my garden last summer.

Now when I sit in my chair and look around, I don’t focus on the gray winter sky or the mounds of dirty snow. I think about the artist who sold me her work at a deep discount because she knew how much I loved it. I think about all the places my sea glass is from. I think about the inn in Maine where my family and I had our happiest times. I think about my Aunt Lorraine. I think about flowers and summer and soft air and warm earth and all the simple things that have sustained me, and that continue to sustain me whenever I remember them.

“Life has a quiet way of passing most of us by, of being gone before we could see what is humanly and spiritually beautiful about it,” she began a 1971 Banner review of a Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists exhibit, a passage that explained why she did what she did.

As the Bay State Banner’s arts editor for 40 years, Kay Bourne spent more nights and weekends than can be counted reviewing and interviewing actors, artists, musicians, and writers — giving many their first media recognition.

Mrs. Bourne, who trained her eyes for decades on the Black arts communities in Roxbury and Dorchester, shining a light on those whose work often went unrecognized in Boston’s other media, died Jan. 31 in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of heart and respiratory ailments.

She was 82 and had lived the past few years in Newton, after spending most of her life in a Brookline Victorian that became a de facto museum for creations by Boston’s Black artists.

“She was a national treasure and icon,” said Gloretta Baynes, an artist who is chairwoman and director of the African American Master Artist in Residence Program at Northeastern University. “She single-handedly supported the Black arts community. And when I say single-handedly, I mean that. Without her support, many artists would not have been recognized for their contributions.”

Barry Gaither, director and curator of the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Roxbury, said that “Kay was an extraordinary supporter of African-American artists across all of the disciplines.”

He added that “there is hardly anyone who has been a performer or a producer of art in Boston’s Black community, earlier than the last decade or so, who did not feel that Kay was a supporter. And I think that mattered.”

Lisa Simmons, director of the Roxbury Film Festival, wrote in a tribute that Mrs. Bourne “was a true champion of so many of us in the Black creative community.”

A journalist for whom tireless could be an insufficient adjective, Mrs. Bourne fit editing and reviewing into a full life outside of her writing.

She and her husband, William N. Bourne, raised their daughter and son in Brookline, where Mr. Bourne taught at the private Park School. Often the couple worked together in the dining room.

“They each had their papers, and they’d be typing away,” said their son Alex of Hallowell, Maine.

Mrs. Bourne also created a school at the Deer Island House of Correction, where she taught general equivalency diploma courses, and worked full-time for many years at the state Department of Transitional Assistance, from which she retired not long before her job at the Banner ended in 2005.

“The top line was humanity; it was people and what they did and how interesting they were and ‘How can I help?’ And she helped a lot of people,” said her longtime friend Barbara Burke, a former associate commissioner for employment and training with the state Department of Public Welfare, the precursor to the Department of Transitional Assistance.

“It was always a joy for her. It wasn’t work,” Burke said. “When I think of Kay, I think of Spike Lee — do the right thing. Kay always did the right thing.”

Mrs. Bourne “was very committed to helping people find their path and live up to their greatness, even when things were tough,” said her daughter, Katie of Melrose. “For me, as a girl growing up in the early ’70s, having her as a role model was incredibly powerful.”

Katherine Elizabeth Day was born in Lynn on Sept. 11, 1938, and grew up in Marblehead, the only child of Schuyler V. Day, who ran a novelties business, and Elsie Mayo Day, who had been a schoolteacher.

After graduating from Marblehead High School, she went to Keene State College, from which she received a bachelor’s degree in education.

While there, she met her future husband, William Bourne. He was a Yale University graduate in a master’s program.

Having heard that a Yalie was on campus, “when she met him he was smoking a pipe and she asked him, ‘Is that the Yale bowl?’ That’s my mom. She was very clever and very funny,” Katie said.

“She was witty,” said Candelaria Silva-Collins, manager for the Fellowes Athenaeum Trust Fund of the Boston Public Library. “She loved smart people; she loved to talk about the latest books she had read or a play she had seen. She was erudite. I really appreciated that.”

Mrs. Bourne also received a master’s from the Harvard Graduate School of Education and had planned for a career in education.

Alex said that as the family story goes, “she went to the Bay State Banner and said they should have a section on the arts. This was in the mid-’60s and the owner said, ‘Why don’t you do it?’ And that’s how she started.”

Along with writing and editing for the Banner, she contributed to the Christian Science Monitor, to EDGE Media, a network of LGBTQ news and entertainment publications, and later started her own online arts report.

The organization Discover Roxbury honored Mrs. Bourne for her journalism, and she received a Champion of Artists award in 2019 from the Massachusetts Artists Leaders Coalition. The Roxbury Film Festival named the Emerging Filmmaker Award in her honor.

“She was just a giant,” said Simmons, the film festival’s director, of Mrs. Bourne, whose institutional memory drew connections between artists and eras. “She was always reminding us that there was a history behind the work that we were presenting in the Black community.”

Some of that history was in Mrs. Bourne’s Brookline home, where she kept every article she had written, the programs of all arts events she attended, shelves of books by Black writers, paintings by Black artists.

“It was like the Library of Congress. It had anything you needed to find out about Black writers, performers, theater,” Simmons said in an interview. “Her knowledge of Boston’s Black arts scene was like nobody else.”

Simmons added that Mrs. Bourne “loved the culture that was coming out of the Black community. She was one of ours.”

Mrs. Bourne, whose husband died in 2005, leaves two grandchildren, in addition to her daughter and son.

A service will be announced once the pandemic’s limitation on the size of gatherings is lifted.

Mrs. Bourne donated more than 1,000 volumes of Black literature to the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, her daughter said, and her archive of the Black arts community will be housed at Emerson College.

“She cared about that archive very deeply,” said Brian Coleman, an author who helped Mrs. Bourne prepare a trove of papers that reflected a dedication that reached beyond journalism’s typical one-off reviews and interviews.

“She kept in touch with people and showed up after the article was written — for years and years — to say, ‘How are you doing? I’ve been following your career.’ That meant so much to people,” he said.

Mrs. Bourne’s work, he added, “was definitely way more than a job to her. It was a calling, and she did it with enthusiasm and compassion and love.”

[],https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/07/metro/george-p-shultz-former-secretary-state-dies-100/,[],"Mr. Shultz was regarded as a model of managerial dependability: pragmatic, low key, unflappable.",[''],en,2/7/2021 0:00,https://www.bostonglobe.com,,set(),"George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under Ronald Reagan and held three top positions under Richard Nixon — secretary of labor, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and secretary of the Treasury — died Saturday. He was 100.

Mr. Shultz died at his home on the campus of Stanford University, the Associated Press reported, citing the Hoover Institution, a think tank where he was a distinguished fellow.

As his holding a quartet of such high-level positions indicates, Mr. Shultz was regarded as a model of managerial dependability: pragmatic, low key, unflappable. Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger once said, “If I could choose one American to whom I would entrust the nation’s fate, it would be George Shultz.” In a 1989 article, The Washington Post lauded Mr. Shultz’s “stolid equanimity” as an antidote to the “Kissinger-Brzezinski-Haig strain of American policy maker.”

Although fundamentally conservative, Mr. Shultz proved a moderating influence in the highly ideological climate of the Reagan presidency. Indeed, some of the greatest turbulence Mr. Shultz faced during his 6½ years as secretary of state emerged within the administration. Three times he told Reagan he was resigning, only to have the president dissuade him.

Joseph Laitin, who served as Mr. Shultz’s press secretary at OMB, once likened him to an elephant. “He puts one foot forward, then gradually shifts weight onto it until he’s sure it’ll hold up, and then puts his next foot forward. And he collects power as he goes along.”

Perhaps the most striking instance of that ability to proceed unhurriedly and prudently and still come out on top was the Iran-Contra scandal, which involved the trading of arms to Iran in return for the release of hostages; in addition, profits from the arms sales were siphoned to Nicaraguan anti-Marxist rebels, the Contras. Although Mr. Shultz was adamantly opposed, the scheme went forward anyway. Clearly, he had lost out in a bureaucratic power struggle with the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. Just as clearly, that opposition greatly enhanced his standing once the scandal broke, at the end of 1986.

Mr. Shultz had previously demonstrated his integrity during the Watergate scandal. As secretary of the Treasury, he dismissed White House complaints about the Internal Revenue Service auditing Richard Nixon’s tax returns and refused to use the IRS to harass Nixon’s political opponents. “What does that candyass think I sent him over there for?” Nixon groused.

No candyass, George Pratt Shultz was a former college football player and Marine combat veteran. He was born on Dec. 13, 1920, in New York, the only child of Birl E. Shultz, a businessman, and Margaret (Pratt) Shultz, a homemaker. The family moved to Englewood, N.J., when Mr. Shultz was young. He attended Princeton University, where he played basketball as well as football. An enduring, if minor, mystery is whether he had the Princeton mascot, a tiger, tatooed on one of his buttocks. Mr. Shultz’s refusal to comment on the matter led many to conclude that he had.

He enlisted in the Marines upon graduation, in 1942. Mr. Shultz saw action in the Pacific as an artillery officer, rising to the rank of captain. While on leave in Hawaii, he met an Army nurse, Helena Maria O’Brien. The couple married in 1946. Mrs. Shultz died in 1995.

An economics major as an undergraduate, Mr. Shultz earned a doctorate in industrial economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949. He taught there from 1949 to 1957, except for the 1955-56 academic year, which he spent as a senior staff economist on the Council of Economic Advisers. Later he would chair committees and work as a consultant for the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

While at MIT, Mr. Shultz had his sole brush with elective office. He ran for the board of a proposed regional school district, which included Stow, where the Shultzes lived. The school proposal was defeated, but Mr. Shultz was elected to the board by a resounding margin.

In 1957, Mr. Shultz accepted a professorship in industrial relations at the University of Chicago School of Business. He became dean in 1962.

Mr. Shultz maintained a Massachusetts connection after leaving MIT. For many years, he owned a farm in Cummington.

During his time at both MIT and Chicago, Mr. Shultz had served as an arbitrator in numerous labor-management disputes. The record he compiled won him the respect of both union and business leaders. Richard Nixon’s naming him secretary of labor in December 1968 was hailed by labor and management alike.

Mr. Shultz spent 18 months in the post. He had to deal with major strikes by East Coast longshoremen, postal workers, and employees at General Electric. His so-called Philadelphia Plan, which set up quotas with the construction trade for minority hires on federal projects, was a landmark in the history of affirmative action. His ordering an investigation of the murder of dissident union leader Joseph Yablonski helped bring down United Mine Workers president Tony Boyle.

Nixon appointed Mr. Shultz first director of the Office of Management and Budget, which replaced the Bureau of the Budget, in June 1970. Two years later, Nixon underscored his reliance on Mr. Shultz, naming him secretary of the Treasury. He served in that post until April 1974, leaving after the second imposition of wage-and-price controls, which he opposed.

Mr. Shultz went to work for the Bechtel Corp., the global construction firm based in San Francisco. He eventually became the company’s president.

After the resignation of Alexander M. Haig Jr., Reagan nominated Mr. Shultz as secretary of state on July 1, 1982. He served in that post for the remainder of Reagan’s presidency.

Mr. Shultz described his steady-as-she-goes philosophy of diplomacy in a 1989 Washington Post interview. “Say there’s a fire. You have to get the fire out. Now at the same time there are various ways you can do it. If you don’t have any strategy you just get the fire out. Now if you have a strategy you say to yourself, ‘Well, all right, I’m going to get this out, but I’m going to do it in such a way that I do it in a manner that is compatible, or at least not incompatible, with my general thrust.’ So what you try to build is the implementation of your strategy by these incremental little things.”

Mr. Shultz’s tenure at State was marked by continuing friction with Congress over the administration’s support of Contra rebels working to overthrow the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.

Never an enthusiast of that policy, Mr. Shultz preferred to emphasize the fight against terrorism. He opposed the withdrawal of US forces from Beirut after a terrorist bombing took the lives of 239 Marines in October 1983. He called for a swift response after Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Achille Lauro, an Italian cruise ship, in 1985. He supported the bombing of Libya the following April in retaliation for its support of terrorism.

Administration policy on terrorism and Central America intersected in the Iran-Contra scandal. In 1985, CIA director William Casey suggested selling US weapons to Iran to obtain the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Mr. Shultz strenuously opposed the idea. It went forward, however, with some of the payments skimmed off to fund the Contras.

“The story was so bizarre it was almost beyond belief,” Mr. Shultz wrote in his 1993 memoirs, “Turmoil and Triumph.” Yet national security adviser John Poindexter asserted that he never kept any information from Mr. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger (who also had opposed the plan) “that they didn’t want withheld.”

Mr. Shultz remembered otherwise. He spent two days detailing to the joint congressional committee investigating Iran-Contra how he and Weinberger had been left in the dark when Poindexter and others went forward with the plan. US Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, said Mr. Shultz gave “the most extraordinary testimony I’ve heard in 17 years in Congress.”

Mr. Shultz’s most important work at the State Department concerned the Soviet Union. Despite such events as the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983, he helped shepherd in the winding down of the Cold War. He participated in summit meetings between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva (1985); Reykjavik (1986); Washington (1987), where the intermediate nuclear-forces treaty was signed; and Moscow (1988).

Reagan awarded Mr. Shultz the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 1989.

Upon leaving the State Department, Mr. Shultz returned to the San Francisco Bay area. He taught at Stanford University, was a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution, and in 1997 married San Francisco’s chief of protocol, Charlotte Mailliard Swig. “I was used to a busy schedule as secretary of state, but this is quite different,” a bemused Mr. Shultz told The San Francisco Chronicle of the 30-or-so parties thrown in the couple’s honor before and after the wedding.

Mr. Shultz remained an active, elder-statesman presence, publishing op-ed articles, making plain in interviews his disapproval of Donald Trump, both as candidate and president, and writing or co-writing several books in his 90s. “A Hinge of History,” written with James Timbie, appeared just a few weeks before his 100th birthday.

At the time, the overwhelming male staff directed most of its resources to helping men become better farmers and entrepreneurs, even while women were doing much of the growing and selling.

Margaret Snyder, whose liberal Roman Catholic upbringing inspired a pioneering career at the United Nations, where she refocused the mechanisms of global development aid to include millions of women in Africa, Asia and Latin America, died Jan. 26 in Syracuse, New York. She was 91.

“There was a failure to realize,” she wrote last year for a UN publication, “that the most serious problems of development defy solution without the involvement of women.”

During her nearly 20 years at the UN and more than 30 years afterward as an informal adviser to the organization, she created and ran a series of programs that brought millions of dollars in training, loans and equipment to women around the world — for instance, supplying mills to women in Burkina Faso to process shea butter and helping Kenyan women counter soil erosion by planting trees.

Known widely as the UN’s “first feminist,” Ms. Snyder promoted women within the organization as well. When she began working at the UN, in the early 1970s, most women there did secretarial work. Under her influence, that began to change: She put young women on her staff and later helped them advance, both at the UN and in their home countries, through her considerable network of contacts, which eventually included presidents like Joyce Banda of Malawi and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia.

“Peg was a trailblazer,” Comfort Lamptey, the UN women’s country representative in Nigeria, said in an interview. “She believed that if you put money in the hands of women, they can do magic.”

Margaret Cecilia Snyder was born Jan. 30, 1929, in East Syracuse, New York. Her father, Matthias, was a doctor, and her mother, Cecilia (Gorman) Snyder, taught Latin and German in a local high school.

She is survived by her brother, Thomas Snyder. Another brother, Robert, died in December.

Syracuse in the first half of the 20th century was a hotbed of liberal Catholic thought, producing leading thinkers and activists like Theodore Hesburgh, the longtime president of the University of Notre Dame, and peace advocates Daniel and Philip Berrigan.

The Snyders were friendly with both families, although Ms. Snyder said her biggest influence was her parents. During the Great Depression, her father put New Deal posters in the window of their home and took in patients on welfare. Her mother brought in extra money by playing the piano for silent movies — earning 30% less than a man who did the same job on other nights, an instance of gender discrimination that Ms. Snyder said inspired her interest in women’s rights.

In high school, Peg worked summers at a settlement house in Syracuse, helping Black migrants as they arrived from the South. She attended the College of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York, graduating in 1950; two years later she received a master’s degree in sociology from the Catholic University of America in Washington.

While working as the women’s dean at Le Moyne College, a liberal Jesuit institution in Syracuse, she became enthralled by John F. Kennedy’s call for young Americans to volunteer overseas. In 1961 she took a yearlong sabbatical to work with volunteer organizations in Tanganyika (which merged with Zanzibar to become Tanzania in 1964) and Uganda. Among other tasks, she arranged for African students to attend college in the United States — part of an effort known as “Kennedy airlifts.”

When her year ended, she quit her job at Le Moyne and stayed in Africa, but she moved home in 1965 to help run the East African Studies program at Syracuse University. She advised students from the region on their graduate work, and many of them went on to hold leadership positions in their countries — the first threads of her continentwide network. Five years later she went back to Tanzania, where she completed a doctorate in sociology at the University of Dar es Salaam in 1971.

That same year she joined the UN as a co-founder of what would become the African Training and Research Center for Women, the organization’s first major program directed specifically at improving economic opportunities for women. In 1978 she moved to New York City, where she was put in charge of a development fund focused on women that was paid for by voluntary contributions from member states.

She built the organization, later renamed the UN Development Fund for Women (and even later UN Women), from operating on a shoestring budget to a global powerhouse that served women not just in Africa but also across the developing world. By the end of the 1980s, it had created women’s development commissions in 30 countries, through which the UN funneled millions of dollars to grassroots women’s projects.

“We were trying to make a paradigm shift from looking at women as mothers to looking at women and their economic activities,” said Thelma Awori, a former assistant secretary-general of the United Nations who worked closely with Ms. Snyder. “Peg picked that up and enlarged it.”

One of her first grants went to Kenya’s Green Belt Movement, an anti-deforestation initiative led by Wangari Maathai, who went on to win the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize in part for that work. Ms. Snyder and Maathai remained close friends — whenever Maathai came to New York she would stay at Ms. Snyder’s apartment in Manhattan, just north of the UN, and Ms. Snyder hosted a wedding party for her daughter Wanjira.

After she retired from the UN in 1989, Ms. Snyder was a Fulbright scholar in Uganda and a visiting fellow at the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. She also wrote or co-wrote three books on women’s economic development in Africa.

But perhaps her most important post-retirement work was as an adviser and advocate for a long list of women activists and organizations, many of whom she hosted at her apartment. It was there, in 2006, that she helped organize the Sirleaf Market Women’s Fund, a program to rebuild markets across war-torn Liberia, named for Sirleaf, the country’s first female president.

For all her career success, Ms. Snyder was in constant conflict with entrenched interests within the UN, both because she was a woman and because her approach to development challenged the ways many of her colleagues were used to doing things. The risk of bureaucratic sabotage was ever-present: Once, Ms. Snyder and her team returned from a trip to find that their office had been moved to a different building, in a room without a single phone line.

But she could take some comfort in the long view: By 2021, women would make up a significant portion of the UN professional staff, and women’s issues, including development, remain one of the organization’s focal points.

“Through all of the administrative issues, we were reminded that working to empower the poorest women was threatening to some high level and powerful people,” she wrote in 2020. “They could move us, but they couldn’t stop us.”","Margaret Snyder, the U.N.’s ‘first feminist,’ dies at 91"

When hit with the second injection, the immune system recognizes the onslaught, and starts to take it even more seriously. The body’s encore act, uncomfortable though it might be, is evidence that the immune system is solidifying its defenses against the virus.

“By the second vaccine, it’s already amped up and ready to go,” Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told me. Fortunately, side effects resolve quickly, whereas COVID-19 can bring on debilitating, months-long symptoms and has killed more than 2 million people.

When the immune system detects a virus, it will dispatch cells and molecules to memorize its features so it can be fought off more swiftly in the future. Vaccines impart these same lessons without involving the disease-causing pathogen itself—the immunological equivalent of training wheels or water wings.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines accomplish that pedagogy via a genetic molecule called mRNA that’s naturally found in human cells. Once delivered into the upper arm, the mRNA instructs the body’s own cells to produce a coronavirus protein called spike—a molecule that elicits powerful, infection-fighting antibody responses in people battling COVID-19.

Read: What’s the use of a pretty good vaccine?

To ensure safe passage of mRNA into cells, the vaccine makers swathed the molecules in greasy bubbles called lipid nanoparticles. These strange, fatty spheres don’t resemble anything naturally present in the body, and they trip the sensors of a cavalry of fast-acting immune cells, called innate immune cells, that patrol the body for foreign matter. Once they spot the nanoparticles, these cells dispatch molecular alarms called cytokines that recruit other immune cells to the site of injection. Marshaling these reinforcements is important, but the influx of cells and molecules makes the upper arm swollen and sore. The congregating cells spew out more cytokines still, flooding the rest of the body with signals that can seed system-wide symptoms such as fever and fatigue.

“It’s the body’s knee-jerk reaction to an infection,” or something that looks like it, Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert and an immunologist at Oregon Health and Science University, told me. “Let’s spray the area down with antiviral cytokines, which also happen to be inflammatory.”

The mRNA itself might also tickle a reaction out of the immune system, simply because of how unusual it looks. “All of a sudden, you have a lot of new RNA that the cell didn’t make,” says Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University, who got her second shot of Moderna’s vaccine last month, with very few side effects.

The provocative nature of mRNA might help explain why Moderna’s shot, which contains three times as much of the genetic material as Pfizer’s, was linked to more side effects in clinical trials.",The Second COVID-19 Shot Is a Rude Reawakening for Immune Cells

The point of the ad isn’t Norway. Norway is the MacGuffin, the foil for Will Ferrell’s hapless masculinity. The point of the ad is that America has lagged behind other rich countries in adopting an important piece of consumer technology, which is (1) correct and (2) partially GM’s fault.

Like, it is GM’s fault recently. Ferrell was an inspired choice, because there’s a certain type of Will Ferrell character—the flabby guy, misled by his vanities, who eventually winds up in the right place partly because of others’ love—that mirrors GM’s past few years. Because GM has had a change of heart on EVs, and it has had it since October.

4. Which is why it’s noteworthy that GM is running this ad—because GM has lately lagged behind its crosstown rival, Ford. In 2017, Mary Barra, GM’s CEO, sat next to Donald Trump when he announced a rollback of climate-pollution rules. Ford’s executive chairman, Bill Ford, opposed that rollback the next year. When the Trump administration sought to strip California of its power to regulate vehicle pollution, GM joined in the lawsuit. Ford and four foreign automakers took California’s side.

GM, in fact, continued to argue that California did not have the power to regulate vehicle pollution until November 23. Then it abruptly announced that, after thinking about it—and, perhaps, after reviewing the election results—the company had decided that California did have that power all along. A pre-Thanksgiving miracle!

This final misery capped four years of defeats. The American public has never seemed to absorb how completely the car industry—and how much GM, specifically—fumbled under Trump.

Read: An inside account of Trump’s fuel-economy debacle

In 2016, the industry celebrated Trump’s win: Finally, here was a pro-business president that it could really work with! What it got instead was a parade of expensive inconveniences. The Obama administration had, for instance, put in rules meant to decrease the carbon pollution that cars emit from their tailpipes; automakers wanted those rules weakened; the Trump administration froze them entirely—a drastic change that had more costs than benefits. Trump harangued GM on Twitter without warning, and threatened to impose new tariffs on its supply chains. And the White House declined last year to extend the federal tax credit for EVs, a move that harmed Tesla and GM specifically while helping foreign automakers.

Federal support for these kinds of policies matters. EVs command 54 percent of the market share in Norway not because Norwegians love Tesla, but because Norway has thrown a small fjord’s worth of incentives and mandates behind them. It is safe to say that, had Trump won 81,000 more votes across four states, we would not be talking about this ad at all.",A Super Bowl Ad That the Biden Presidency Made Possible

In the sketch, a group of friends gathers for a watch party and validates one another’s dangerous choices during the pandemic, insisting that they’ve been, as Heidi Gardner’s character puts it, “doing everything right.” The punch line seems evident from the first bits of dialogue: These characters will all end up infected, given that their “safe” choices have been totally reckless. Yet, just when the sketch appears to be ending, Anthony Fauci (played by Kate McKinnon) shows up, revealing the scenario to be a PSA. Fauci then trots out the South Korean “Gangnam Style” singer, Psy (Bowen Yang), to help spread the message. The cast dances enthusiastically, and the sketch draws its biggest laughs from the sweet silliness of this moment. But the message sticks for that same reason: If the sketch had solely mocked its characters’ behavior, SNL would have come off as preachy. Instead, it deployed a familiar gag—a “celebrity” guest—to make the sketch memorable, and to poke fun at the way the U.S. government, under President Joe Biden, might think that Psy, a viral star from 2012, would feel relevant enough for such a campaign.

Other sketches also used this sleight of hand, Trojan horse–ing in more incisive jokes through established setups. The pretaped Zillow ad, about how searching home listings can be a sensual activity, is perfectly funny for the way the cast members throw themselves into the bit. But the deeper joke targets the sad reality of how homeownership has become a fantasy for many, including, as Yang’s character notes, those in their late 30s. Similarly, the musical sketch “Hot Damn,” despite being a smaller-scale version of this spectacle that pokes fun at how seriously Americans take the Super Bowl, also suggests a more trenchant joke. Cecily Strong and Levy play New York City bartenders forcing their patrons to sing a song with them, and watching the rest of the cast join in on their goofy choreography is fun. But the pair are revealed to be out-of-work actors whose desperate need for a stage suggests a sadness to the proceedings. Broadway has been closed for almost a year. Of course these two would miss singing and dancing so much that they’d turn their new job into a performance.

Then again, not every beat of last night’s SNL had something more penetrating in mind. If anything, the lightness gave its writers more room to put together catchy one-liners (“former social-media influencer Donald Trump”) rather than entire concepts, and to let the jokes take precedence over commentary on today’s issues. Timely political humor often took that luxury away, leaving the cast reliant on impressions. But last night, cast members could truly perform to build characters. Joy is in short supply these days, and many of the sketches simply left a smile on my face.",SNL Is Breaking With Its Old Patterns

In one scene, Malcolm complains about how past filmmakers didn’t have to talk about whether their work had a political message, but he does. In another, he goes on a didactic tangent about why authenticity shouldn’t matter; “interpreting reality,” he argues, is the filmmaker’s job. He also picks at an old wound caused by a critic he calls “the white lady from the L.A. Times,” who panned a previous work. He bristles at her latest, positive review because she brings up his race in relation to the film’s subject. Perhaps Levinson, a white man, knew he’d be scrutinized for using a Black character to critique the role that race can play in a project’s reception. If so, his defense mechanism—having Malcolm launch into a speech about how critics shouldn’t judge a film “due to an intangible yet purely hypothetical assessment of one’s identity”—hints of self-pity.

DOMINIC MILLER / NETFLIX

But if Levinson misuses Washington’s talent by having the actor serve as his shield, he fares worse with Zendaya. Marie, once an aspiring actor, is relegated to talking Malcolm off his soapbox over and over, like a publicist all too aware that the pair of them are being watched. Zendaya’s natural screen presence saves some of the thin, self-conscious material. Her glares, coiled body language, and wavering tone imply more hurt than any lines in her overwritten dialogue ever do. (“I’m the last person standing,” she whimpers toward the end of the film. “If this is a movie, you hold on to me for dear fucking life.”) She even makes some of Levinson’s words work: In one scene, she envisions where Malcolm’s career might take him and the tricky discourse it could inspire—and makes the sermon sound like playful flirting.

Using a romantic relationship as the framework for interrogating the relationship between artist and critic isn’t a bad idea. But any passion-fueled tension gets steamrolled by what amounts to a debate Levinson seems to be having with himself. He appears to be frustrated with the state of his industry, and with the perceived injustices his projects have had to suffer in the past—including, yes, a white female critic from the L.A. Times panning one of his films. Malcolm & Marie is akin to watching two sentient think pieces scream at each other. The self-indulgence of the script takes up so much air, it’s a small miracle that Washington and Zendaya don’t disappear.

This isn’t to say that the complaints Malcolm articulates shouldn’t be explored. A worthwhile conversation could be had about how criticism should view art in relation to an artist’s identity, how race informs a work’s reception, and how difficult it has become at times to separate a project’s supposed message from its craft. And delving into the psyche of a character like Malcolm, a Hollywood filmmaker at the height of his success, could be valuable: Fame and ego make a potent, dangerous mix, especially for someone in the entertainment industry. But reducing it all to a monotonous back-and-forth betrays any points Levinson might have been making about the pain of being misunderstood, and the pressure that comes with being in the brightest spotlight, on the biggest stage. Maybe the writer-director should have instead done what Malcolm derides as the antithesis of filmmaking: turn the camera on, point it toward himself, and upload his screed online.",Malcolm & Marie Isn’t Art.

David A. Graham: This is the cost of a failed impeachment

Trump will be back, of course. This week, the Senate will hold an impeachment trial over his role in the Capitol insurrection. Even if he doesn’t speak publicly, he’ll be thrust back into the national spotlight. What’s more, Trumpism seems to be metastasizing. A band of congressional acolytes is the newest avatar for the conspiracism and grievance that fueled Trump’s movement. “Yes, he’s not on Twitter and that makes a difference,” Sarah Longwell, the founder of the Republican Accountability Project and an ardent Trump critic, told me. “But he has all these mini-me’s—the craziness is still there.”

Trump’s successor likely isn’t sorry to see him sidelined. At a news briefing last week, Joe Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, got a question about whether the work goes more smoothly when Trump stays mute. “This may be hard to believe: We don’t spend a lot of time talking about or thinking about President Trump here—former President Trump, to be very clear,” Psaki replied.

Former president. The idea still takes some getting used to. Len Fonte, a playwright and theater critic in the Syracuse, New York, area, described Trump as “an addiction even for those of us who can’t stand him.” In the mornings, Fonte said, he would “rush to the television to hear [MSNBC’s] Joe Scarborough screaming about him. I had to start weaning myself away from all that.” For a respite, he would turn to The Great British Baking Show, just so he could focus on something more benign. (A disclaimer: My wife has me watching the same show and an episode featuring a tart-making competition was indeed a mind-clearing diversion.)

For those whose work routine centered around Trump, the void he’s left is even more jarring. Mike Elgan, a tech writer, estimates that he’s sent thousands of tweets over the years in response to Trump’s feed. One goal was to send them out quickly—within seconds of Trump tweeting—in the hope that Trump supporters would read them and be swayed by whatever counterargument he was offering.",The Hole Where Donald Trump Was

The only health advice more banal than being told to wash your hands is being told to sleep more. But it’s a cliché for a reason. Sleep fortifies and prepares us for any given crisis, but especially when the days are short and cold, and people have little else they might do to empower and protect themselves. Monotonous days can slip people into depression, alcohol abuse, and all manner of suboptimal health. It may well turn out that standard pandemic advice should be to wear a mask, keep distances, and get sleep.

That’s easier said than done. Asim Shah, a psychiatry and behavioral-sciences professor at Baylor College of Medicine, believes sleep is at the core of many of the mental-health issues that have spiked over the course of the year. “There’s a complete lack of structure. That has caused a huge disturbance in the sleep cycles,” he says. “Usually everyone has a schedule. They get sunlight and they generate melatonin and it puts them to sleep. Right now we’re seeing people losing interest in things, isolating, not exercising, and then not getting sleep.” Depression and anxiety make insomnia worse, and the cycle degenerates.

Read: How to sleep

This may be where melatonin—or other approaches to enhancing the potent effects of sleep—could be consequential. Russel Reiter, a cell-biology professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, is convinced that widespread treatment of COVID-19 with melatonin should already be standard practice. In May, Reiter and colleagues published a plea for melatonin to be immediately given to everyone with COVID-19.

If the world of melatonin research had a molten core, it would be Reiter. He has been studying the hormone’s potential health benefits since the 1960s, and tells me he takes 70 milligrams daily. (Most bottles at the pharmacy recommend from 1 to 10 milligrams.) After we spoke, he sent me some of the many journal articles he has published on melatonin and COVID-19, at least four of which appeared in Melatonin Research. He blithely referred to them as “propaganda” and noted that he has been studying melatonin since before I was born (without asking when that was). “I know melatonin sideways and backwards,” Reiter said, “and I’m very confident recommending it.”

The majority of sleep scientists, though, seem to agree that the most crucial interventions that facilitate sleep will not be medicinal, or even supplemental. The general recommendation is that getting your body’s melatonin cycles to work regularly is preferable to simply taking a supplement and continuing to binge Netflix and stare at your phone in bed. Now that so many people’s days lack structure, Shah believes a key to healthy pandemic sleep is to deliberately build routines. On weekends, wake up and go to bed at the same time as you do other days. Take scheduled walks. Get sunlight early in the day. Reduce blue light for an hour before bed. Stay connected with other people in meaningful ways, despite being physically distant.",The Mysterious Link Between COVID-19 and Sleep

None has resulted in removal, but all four had seismic political consequences.

Andrew Johnson was not removed in 1868, but he was not renominated, either, and failed to gain the second term he so wanted.

Richard Nixon was not removed in 1974; he resigned amid an immense scandal.

Bill Clinton was not removed in 1998. Instead, Clinton’s became the first administration since Reconstruction to gain congressional seats in the sixth year of its term. His chief opponent, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, resigned instead, as did Gingrich’s immediate successor, Speaker Bob Livingston.

Donald Trump was not removed in 2020, but he lost the presidency, and his party lost control of the Senate.

Impeachments were designed as ways to remove corrupt federal officials. That function has mostly gone dormant, replaced by the operations of federal public-integrity law, enforced by the Department of Justice. Each month, DOJ announces actions in some two dozen cases. Recent announcements include the conviction of a former mayor in the federal territory of Guam on extortion changes and a former border officer on bribery charges.

But what impeachment can do in the modern era is send a powerful signal to the public about the gravity of certain cases. When the House impeaches, it declares: We believe we have exited normal politics; we believe we are dealing with a true emergency.

It elevates the president’s alleged abuse over all other congressional business. Impeachment empowers the House to force an issue onto the agenda of the slower-moving Senate. Impeachment changes the calendar of politics. Impeachment concentrates and clarifies issues. Impeachment compels senators to take a public stand one way or the other: convict or acquit.

Because impeachment is such an extraordinary act, it is also profoundly risky to its proponents. If done wrong, it will redound upon the impeachers, as Clinton’s impeachment redounded upon Gingrich and the House Republicans.

In 1998, a substantial majority of the American people rejected the Republican impeachment case against Clinton. After the House approved articles of impeachment, Clinton’s approval jumped to a new high of 73 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, and approval of Republicans tumbled to 31 percent.

Even the fiercest partisans sense those risks. That’s why impeachment does not happen promiscuously. Ronald Reagan was not impeached for Iran-Contra. George W. Bush was not impeached after Democrats won the House and Senate in 2006. Barack Obama was not impeached despite the fervor of the Tea Party Republicans who took the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014.

The Trump impeachment, by contrast, was supported by a consistent if narrow majority. Seventy percent of Americans condemned Trump’s attempted extortion of Ukraine’s government to aid his reelection. Trump and his supporters hoped and trusted that impeachment would backfire in 2020 as it had in 1998. Pro-Trump pundits confidently predicted that it would backfire. Those pro-Trump hopes were disappointed. The process began and ended with most Americans accepting that Trump had committed impeachable offenses and that he deserved to be removed from office for those offenses.",Impeachment Is Working—Just Not as the Framers Expected

Last year, erstwhile Attorney General William Barr raised the case to argue that Beijing is “loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself.”

As Michael Ondaatje, one of Sri Lanka’s greatest chroniclers, once said, “In Sri Lanka a well-told lie is worth a thousand facts.” And the debt-trap narrative is just that: a lie, and a powerful one.

Read: What happens when China leads the world

Our research shows that Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country, much less the port of Hambantota. A Chinese company’s acquisition of a majority stake in the port was a cautionary tale, but it’s not the one we’ve often heard. With a new administration in Washington, the truth about the widely, perhaps willfully, misunderstood case of Hambantota Port is long overdue.

The city of Hambantota lies at the southern tip of Sri Lanka, a few nautical miles from the busy Indian Ocean shipping lane that accounts for nearly all of the ocean-borne trade between Asia and Europe, and more than 80 percent of ocean-borne global trade. When a Chinese firm snagged the contract to build the city’s port, it was stepping into an ongoing Western competition, though one the United States had largely abandoned.

It was the Canadian International Development Agency—not China—that financed Canada’s leading engineering and construction firm, SNC-Lavalin, to carry out a feasibility study for the port. We obtained more than 1,000 pages of documents detailing this effort through a Freedom of Information Act request. The study, concluded in 2003, confirmed that building the port at Hambantota was feasible, and supporting documents show that the Canadians’ greatest fear was losing the project to European competitors. SNC-Lavalin recommended that it be undertaken through a joint-venture agreement between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and a “private consortium” on a build-own-operate-transfer basis, a type of project in which a single company receives a contract to undertake all the steps required to get such a port up and running, and then gets to operate it when it is.

The Canadian project failed to move forward, mostly because of the vicissitudes of Sri Lankan politics. But the plan to build a port in Hambantota gained traction during the rule of the Rajapaksas—Mahinda Rajapaksa, who served as president from 2005 through 2015, and his brother Gotabaya, the current president and former minister of defense—who grew up in Hambantota. They promised to bring big ships to the region, a call that gained urgency after the devastating 2004 tsunami pulverized Sri Lanka’s coast and the local economy.",The Chinese ‘Debt Trap’ Is a Myth

In July, a large Korean survey found that children ages 10 to 19 spread the coronavirus about as efficiently as, or even more aggressively than, older adults. (It found that kids under 10 did not transmit the virus as much.) This frightening conclusion was widely interpreted to rule out the possibility of in-person school for any children in fifth grade or above. But in August, the same Korean research team caveated those conclusions, saying it couldn’t prove whether the children in the study were infecting their parents, or whether those parents were infecting their kids, or whether entire households were being exposed by a third party.

More infamous was the reported outbreak at a Jerusalem high school over the summer, which made headlines around the world. The New York Times’ summary was representative: “When Covid Subsided, Israel Reopened Its Schools. It Didn’t Go Well.” Here’s how the Times described the outbreak:

The Israeli government invited the entire student body back in late May. Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in Israel, possibly the world. The virus rippled out to the students’ homes and then to other schools and neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives.

The Israeli lesson seemed simple: If you open your schools, cases will explode, the outbreak will reverberate throughout the country, and people will die.

Except it wasn’t that simple. Last week, a follow-up study of the Israel cluster found that what had been universally described as a school outbreak was really nothing of the sort. At the same time that Israel reopened schools, it eased restrictions on large group gatherings. “Easing restrictions on large scale gatherings was the major influence on this resurgence,” the authors concluded. “No increase was observed in COVID-19 … following school reopening.” The causal chain described by The New York Times was backwards. The real story went like this: Relax social-distancing measures in your community without vaccines, see cases explode, and then watch the outbreak ripple into schools.

Chris Cook: Why British kids went back to school, and American kids did not

As the evidence of children’s COVID-19 risk has diminished in the past six months, the evidence that families are struggling with school closures has mounted.

“If you ask me whether we are doing our duty as a society to look after children, my answer would be ‘No, I don’t think so,’” Matthew Snape, a pediatric researcher at the University of Oxford, told me. “There is clear evidence that shutting schools harms students directly, in terms of both their education and their mental and social health.”

Although the long-term scholastic and social effects of a year of remote learning on this generation of children are not yet clear, what we know already is damning enough: Remote learning has gutted public schools as high-income parents pull their kids into private schools and bespoke learning pods. Calls to mental-health hotlines have increased. In Las Vegas, home to the nation’s fifth-largest school district, a cluster of student suicides has pushed local officials to phase in elementary schools. More indirectly, school closures also result in the delay of immunization programs, interrupt free-lunch programs, and make impossible the edifying effects of play.","The Truth About Kids, School, and COVID-19"

If R is higher than 1, then a surge is building. Right now, California has an R of 0.77, according to the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases. Were B.1.1.7 to become the dominant strain in California right now, Andersen said, the state would head back into a surge.

“The U.S. has never been at an effective reproduction number that would allow us to control the variant,” he said.

Even aside from the variant, predicting the virus’s fate in the spring is hard. To understand why, we can look at the stars.

Not astrology: I mean literally looking at the stars. When you peer through a telescope at Proxima Centauri, the sun’s nearest neighbor, you never see the star as it exists today. Its light takes time—4.2 years—to reach us and register in a measurable way.

Try to determine what’s happening in the pandemic at any one moment—how many people are now infected with the virus, for instance—and you face the same problem. Pandemic data suffer a lag too, although biological math and human circumstance, not the vastness of space, determine their delay.

In practice, COVID-19 case and test data are a window to the recent past. On average, patients do not develop their first COVID-19 symptom until four or five days after exposure to the virus. Figure that it takes another day or two for someone to get tested, then another for the lab to run the test and deliver a result. The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic estimates that another one to three days elapse as the lab reports the result to the state and the state publishes it. This lengthy process means that someone who is reported to be sick today might have been infected a week or two ago.

This latency matters just as much when the pandemic news is good as when it’s bad—and in recent days, the news has been very good. In the past week, the average number of new cases a day has fallen by double-digit percentages in 38 states and by single-digit percentages in eight, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. (Cases are rising by double-digit percentages only in Texas and Washington.) Hospitalizations are a more timely measure of the pandemic’s spread and they, too, are falling in every state but Vermont and New Mexico. Even former hot spots are abating: In California, the average number of new cases has fallen by more than half since January 1.

The speed of vaccinations is increasing. In the past week, the U.S. has given 1.3 million shots each day, according to Bloomberg, meeting President Joe Biden’s initial goal of vaccinating 1 million Americans a day. (Biden, in response, upped the goal to 1.5 million vaccinations a day.) Life’s daily rituals could begin to resume: As the Harvard epidemiologist Julia Marcus recently wrote in The Atlantic, if you get a vaccine, you should be able to hug another vaccinated person with much less apprehension. Although something could still go horrendously awry—a strain of the virus could evolve, for instance, against which the vaccine is dramatically less effective—that seems, for now, unlikely.",The Pandemic Is Heading Toward a Strange In-Between Time

['Bourree Lam'],https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/being-a-go-getter-is-no-fun/393863/,[],New research suggests that competent employees are assigned more work—but they don't always like it.,[''],en,2015-05-22 08:35:00-04:00,https://www.theatlantic.com,,set(),"“People ask high self-control people to do more for perfectly logical reasons—because they think that those who successfully demonstrate high (vs. low) self-control will perform better and accomplish more. So it is a reasonable thing to do, from the perspective of the partner, the manager, the coworker,” says Christy Zhou Koval, a Ph.D student at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and lead author of the study.“But for the actor, it can feel like a burden. Why should you do more work for the same reward, while your less capable coworker coasts along with lower expectations and work?”

A separate experiment found that participants not only assigned more tasks to the go-getters—but underestimated how much work it would take to get the job done. ""What looks easy from the outside may not feel that easy on the inside,"" says Gráinne Fitzsimons, one of the co-authors of the study.

The researchers then tried to understand how these expectations play out in real life. In a survey of more than 400 employees, they found that high performers were not only aware that they were giving more at work—they rightly assumed that their managers and co-workers didn’t understand how hard it was for them, and thus felt unhappy about being given more tasks. Further, in a survey that was completed by more than 100 couples, partners who had greater self-control said they also felt burden and fatigue from being relied on more at home. (Interestingly, the results of these studies were not broken down by gender, though this certainly opens up a new angle for future study.)

“This disconnect in how we see ourselves and how others see us can create problems in our relationships, both at home and at work,” says Koval. “Part of the issue is that people with high self-control are probably less likely than others to complain; they’re just likelier to ‘suck it up’ and do the extra work. But our findings suggest that they probably feel frustrated by that, and less satisfied with their relationships with others who do ‘over-rely’ on them.”

While it makes sense to rely more on competent people, Koval says that it’s important for co-workers and partners to recognize how much stress they are putting on those people by doing so. In the workplace, she recommends giving rewards to the responsible employees. Similarly she recommends that romantic partners pitch in, and give credit where it’s due.

“In the workplace, managers should be careful to give the highest quality work and best opportunities to the most capable employees, and give the lower quality but time consuming work to less capable employees,” says Koval. “If someone is doing more than his fair share, compensate him for it. If not, he may ultimately leave and seek recognition elsewhere. Similarly, in our personal relationships, we should recognize that just because our high-ability partners can do something for us, doesn’t mean that we should let them. And if they do help us, we should recognize it and thank them for it. Otherwise, they too may end up feeling burdened by us, and less satisfied—and that should be the last thing we want to do to a good employee or a good partner.”

Trump’s supporters have. Even after everything that’s happened—Trump’s attempt to overturn the election, his cheerleading for the attack on the Capitol—some influential evangelical leaders are still defending the president: “Shame, shame,” Franklin Graham, the evangelist and son of the famous pastor Billy Graham, wrote about the 10 Republicans who voted for impeachment. “It makes you wonder what the 30 pieces of silver were that Speaker Pelosi promised for this betrayal.” In the metaphor, the Republican dissidents are cast as Judas, who is said to have betrayed Jesus in exchange for 30 coins. Trump plays the role of Christ.

Looking to political personalities rather than Jesus for salvation is the worst kind of mistake a Christian can make, Kinzinger said. “There are many people that have made America their god, that have made the economy their god, that have made Donald Trump their god, and that have made their political identity their god.” The problems that led to the January 6 insurrection are not just political. They’re cultural. Roughly half of Protestant pastors said they regularly hear people promote conspiracy theories in their churches, a recent survey by the Southern Baptist firm LifeWay Research found. “I believe there is a huge burden now on Christian leaders, especially those who entertained the conspiracies, to lead the flock back into the truth,” Kinzinger tweeted on January 12.

Read: A Christian insurrection

As a kid growing up in a Baptist church, Kinzinger was “constantly in Sunday school,” and his dad ran ministries that served the hungry and the homeless. Politics was a natural part of this world: Kinzinger attended meetings of the Christian Coalition, the evangelical advocacy group, and learned about the importance of advocating against abortion. But over time, as the tie between Republican politics and evangelical Christianity got tighter, he began to see conservative policies used as a litmus test for whether people were true Christians. Kinzinger believed that Republican ideas were superior to Democratic ones—he first got elected to the county board in McLean County, Illinois, as a 20-year-old local-government advocate. But it bothered him that many Republicans viewed their political opponents as evil enemies, rather than people who might even share their faith. “We get wrapped up in thinking that every little political victory that we do [that] has an impact on an election is actually fighting for God and the truth,” he said.

Kinzinger first got elected to Congress under Barack Obama, and over the past decade, he has watched his party transform. “No longer does policy actually matter. It’s all about: Do you support Donald Trump, or don’t you? Do you want to own the left, or don’t you?” he said. Although he stated publicly that he wouldn’t vote for Trump in 2016, he did vote for the president in 2020, citing a desire to build on the administration’s policy successes. Unlike some Republicans, he has not spent the past four years on the front lines of the Never Trump resistance; he generally supported Trump’s agenda in Congress, voting in line with the president’s goals roughly 90 percent of the time. But unlike other members of the GOP, Kinzinger was unwilling to keep fighting for Trump after it was clear that he had lost the election. “I’m embarrassed by some of my Republican colleagues on the floor. They have defaulted to political points for fame and have failed to rise to this moment,” he tweeted on January 6. He later joined Democrats to encourage Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment and remove Trump from office.",Betraying Your Church—And Your Party

In his photo illustrations throughout this article, the colors of the original photos have been adjusted, but the images are otherwise unaltered. This article was published online on February 3, 2021. We live on a wild planet, a wobbly, erupting, ocean-sloshed orb that careens around a giant thermonuclear explosion in the void. Big rocks whiz by overhead, and here on the Earth’s surface, whole continents crash together, rip apart, and occasionally turn inside out, killing nearly everything. Our planet is fickle. When the unseen tug of celestial bodies points Earth toward a new North Star, for instance, the shift in sunlight can dry up the Sahara, or fill it with hippopotamuses. Of more immediate interest today, a variation in the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere of as little as 0.1 percent has meant the difference between sweltering Arctic rainforests and a half mile of ice atop Boston. That negligible wisp of the air is carbon dioxide.

Since about the time of the American Civil War, CO 2 ’s crucial role in warming the planet has been well understood. And not just based on mathematical models: The planet has run many experiments with different levels of atmospheric CO 2 . At some points in the Earth’s history, lots of CO 2 has vented from the crust and leaped from the seas, and the planet has gotten warm. At others, lots of CO 2 has been hidden away in the rocks and in the ocean’s depths, and the planet has gotten cold. The sea level, meanwhile, has tried to keep up—rising and falling over the ages, with coastlines racing out across the continental shelf, only to be drawn back in again. During the entire half-billion-year Phanerozoic eon of animal life, CO 2 has been the primary driver of the Earth’s climate. And sometimes, when the planet has issued a truly titanic slug of CO 2 into the atmosphere, things have gone horribly wrong. Today, humans are injecting CO 2 into the atmosphere at one of the fastest rates ever over this entire, near-eternal span. When hucksters tell you that the climate is always changing, they’re right, but that’s not the good news they think it is. “The climate system is an angry beast,” the late Columbia climate scientist Wally Broecker was fond of saying, “and we are poking it with sticks.” The beast has only just begun to snarl. All of recorded human history—at only a few thousand years, a mere eyeblink in geologic time—has played out in perhaps the most stable climate window of the past 650,000 years. We have been shielded from the climate’s violence by our short civilizational memory, and our remarkably good fortune. But humanity’s ongoing chemistry experiment on our planet could push the climate well beyond those slim historical parameters, into a state it hasn’t seen in tens of millions of years, a world for which Homo sapiens did not evolve.

When there’s been as much carbon dioxide in the air as there already is today—not to mention how much there’s likely to be in 50 or 100 years—the world has been much, much warmer, with seas 70 feet higher than they are today. Why? The planet today is not yet in equilibrium with the warped atmosphere that industrial civilization has so recently created. If CO 2 stays at its current levels, much less steadily increases, it will take centuries—even millennia—for the planet to fully find its new footing. The transition will be punishing in the near term and the long term, and when it’s over, Earth will look far different from the one that nursed humanity. This is the grim lesson of paleoclimatology: The planet seems to respond far more aggressively to small provocations than it’s been projected to by many of our models. To truly appreciate the coming changes to our planet, we need to plumb the history of climate change. So let us take a trip back into deep time, a journey that will begin with the familiar climate of recorded history and end in the feverish, high-CO 2 greenhouse of the early age of mammals, 50 million years ago. It is a sobering journey, one that warns of catastrophic surprises that may be in store. Read: Scientists have uncovered a disturbing climate change precedent The first couple of steps back in time won’t take us to a warmer world—but they will illuminate just what sort of ill-tempered planet we’re dealing with. As we pull back even slightly from the span of recorded history—our tiny sliver of geologic time—we’ll notice almost at once that the entire record of human civilization is perched at the edge of a climate cliff. Below is a punishing ice age. As it turns out, we live on an ice-age planet, one marked by the swelling and disintegration of massive polar ice sheets in response to tiny changes in sunlight and CO 2 levels. Our current warmer period is merely one peak in a mountain range, with each summit an interglacial springtime like today, and each valley floor a deep freeze. It takes some doing to escape this cycle, but with CO 2 as it is now, we won’t be returning to an ice age for the foreseeable future. And to reach analogues for the kind of warming we’ll likely see in the coming decades and centuries, we will need to move beyond the past 3 million years of ice ages entirely, and make drastic jumps back into the alien Earths of tens of millions of years ago. Our future may come to resemble these strange lost worlds.

Before we move more dramatically backwards in time, let us briefly pause over the history of civilization, and then some. Ten thousand years ago, the big mammals had just vanished, at human hands, in Eurasia and the Americas. Steppes once filled with mammoths and camels and wetlands stocked with giant beavers were suddenly, stunningly vacant. The coastlines that civilization presumes to be eternal were still far beyond today’s horizon. But the seas were rising. The doomed vestiges of mile-thick ice sheets that had cloaked a third of North American land were retreating to the far corners of Canada, chased there by tundra and taiga. The roughly 13 quintillion gallons of meltwater these ice sheets would hemorrhage, in a matter of millennia, raised the sea level hundreds of feet, leaving coral reefs that had been bathed in sunlight under shallow waves now drowned in the deep. By 9,000 years ago, humans in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mexico, and the Andes had independently developed agriculture and—after 200,000 years of wandering—had begun to stay put. Sedentary settlements blossomed. Humans, with a surfeit of calories, began to divide their labor, and artisans plied new arts. The Earth’s oldest cities, such as Jericho, were bustling. By 5,000 years ago, sunlight had waned in the Northern summer, and rains drifted south toward the equator again. The green Sahara began to die, as it had many times before. It’s easy to forget that the Earth—cozy, pastoral, familiar—is nevertheless a celestial body, and astronomy still has a vote in earthly affairs. Every 20,000 years or so the planet swivels about its axis, and 10,000 years ago, at civilization’s first light, the Earth’s top half was aimed toward the sun during the closest part of its orbit—an arrangement today enjoyed by the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting Northern-summer warmth turned the Sahara green. Lakes, hosting hippos, crocodiles, turtles, and buffalo, speckled North Africa, Arabia, and everywhere in between. Lake Chad, which today finds itself overtaxed and shrinking toward oblivion, was “Mega-Chad,” a 115,000-square-mile freshwater sea that sprawled across the continent. Beneath the Mediterranean today, hundreds of dark mud layers alternate with whiter muck, a barcode that marks the Sahara’s rhythmic switching from lush green to continent-spanning desert.

Imprinted on top of this cycle were the last gasps of an ice age that had gripped the planet for the previous 100,000 years. The Earth was still thawing, and amid the final approach of the rising tides, enormous plains and forests like Doggerland—a lowland that had joined mainland Europe to the British Isles—were abandoned by nomadic humans and offered to the surging seas. Vast islands like Georges Bank, 75 miles off Massachusetts—which once held mastodons and giant ground sloths—saw their menagerie overtaken. Scallop draggers still pull up their tusks and teeth today, far offshore. By 5,000 years ago, as humanity was emerging from its unlettered millennia, the ice had stopped melting and oceans that had been surging for 15,000 years finally settled on modern shorelines. Sunlight had waned in the Northern summer, and rains drifted south toward the equator again. The green Sahara began to die, as it had many times before. Hunter-fisher-gatherers who for thousands of years had littered the verdant interior of North Africa with fishhooks and harpoon points abandoned the now-arid wastelands, and gathered along the Nile. The age of pharaohs began. By geologic standards, the climate has been remarkably stable ever since, until the sudden warming of the past few decades. That’s unsettling, because history tells us that even local, trivial climate misadventures during this otherwise peaceful span can help bring societies to ruin. In fact, 3,200 years ago, an entire network of civilizations—a veritable globalized economy—fell apart when minor climate chaos struck.

“There is famine in [our] house; we will all die of hunger. If you do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from your land.” This letter was sent between associates at a commercial firm in Syria with outposts spread across the region, as cities from the Levant to the Euphrates fell. Across the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia, dynasties that had ruled for centuries were all collapsing. The mortuary-temple walls of Ramses III—the last great pharaoh of Egypt’s New Kingdom period—speak of waves of mass migration, over land and sea, and warfare with mysterious invaders from afar. Within decades the entire Bronze Age world had collapsed. Historians have advanced many culprits for the breakdown, including earthquakes and rebellions. But like our own teetering world—one strained by souring trade relations, with fractious populaces led by unsteady, unscrupulous leaders and now stricken by plague—the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean were ill-prepared to accommodate the deteriorating climate. While one must resist environmental determinism, it is nevertheless telling that when the region mildly cooled and a centuries-long drought struck around 1200 B.C., this network of ancient civilizations fell to pieces. Even Megiddo, the biblical site of Armageddon, was destroyed. This same story is told elsewhere, over and over, throughout the extremely mild stretch of time that is written history. The Roman empire’s imperial power was vouchsafed by centuries of warm weather, but its end saw a return to an arid cold—perhaps conjured by distant pressure systems over Iceland and the Azores. In A.D. 536, known as the worst year to be alive, one of Iceland’s volcanoes exploded, and darkness descended over the Northern Hemisphere, bringing summer snow to China and starvation to Ireland. In Central America several centuries later, when the reliable band of tropical rainfall that rings the Earth left the Mayan lowlands and headed south, the megalithic civilization above it withered. In North America, a megadrought about 800 years ago made ancestral Puebloans abandon cliffside villages like Mesa Verde, as Nebraska was swept by giant sand dunes and California burned. In the 15th century, a 30-year drought bookended by equally unhelpful deluges brought the Khmer at Angkor low. The “hydraulic empire” had been fed and maintained by an elaborate irrigation system of canals and reservoirs. But when these canals ran dry for decades, then clogged with rains, invaders easily toppled the empire in 1431, and the Khmer forfeited their temples to the jungle.

What Made Me Reconsider the Anthropocene

Re-Engineering the Earth Hopscotching through these human disasters to the present day, we pass perhaps the most familiar historical climate event of all: the Little Ice Age. Lasting roughly from 1500 to 1850, the chill made ice rinks of Dutch canals, and swelled up Swiss mountain glaciers. Tent cities sprung up on a frozen Thames, and George Washington endured his winter of cold and privation at Valley Forge in 1777 (which wasn’t even particularly harsh for the times). The Little Ice Age might have been a regional event, perhaps the product of an exceptional run of sunlight-dimming volcanism. In 1816, its annus horribilis, the so-called year without a summer—which brought snows to New England in August—global temperatures dropped perhaps a mere half a degree Celsius. While it is perennially plumbed by historians for insights into future climate change, it is not even remotely on the same scale of disruption as that which might lie in our future.

As Europe emerged from its chill, coal from 300-million-year-old jungles was being fed into English furnaces. Although the Earth was now in the same configuration that, in the previous few million years, had invited a return to deep, unthinkable ice ages, for some reason the next ice age never took. Instead the planet embarked on an almost unprecedented global chemistry experiment. Halfway through the 20th century, the climate began behaving very strangely. Read: The strange future Hurricane Harvey portends So this is the climate of written history, a seemingly eventful stretch that has really been the random noise and variability of a climate essentially at peace. Indeed, if you were to find yourself in an industrial civilization somewhere else in the universe, you would almost certainly notice such similarly strange and improbably pleasant millennia behind you. This kind of climate stability seems to be a prerequisite for organized society. It is, in other words, as good as it gets. As we jump back 20,000 years—to yesterday, geologically—the world ceases being recognizable. Whereas all of recorded history played out in a climate hovering well within a band of 1 degree Celsius, we now see what a difference 5 to 6 degrees can make—a scale of change similar to the one that humans may engineer in only the next century or so, though in this case, the world is 5 to 6 degrees colder, not warmer.

An Antarctica’s worth of ice now rests atop North America. Similar sheets smother northern Europe, and as a result, the sea level is now 400 feet lower. The midwestern United States is carpeted in stands of stunted spruce of the sort that would today look at home in northern Quebec. The Rockies are carved up, not by wildflower-dappled mountain valleys, but by overflowing rivers of ice and rock. California is a land of dire wolves. Where the Pacific Northwest edges up against the American Antarctica, it is a harsh and treeless place. Nevada and Utah fill up with cold rains. During World War II, at Topaz, the desolate Japanese American internment camp in Utah, prisoners combed the flats of the Sevier Desert for unlikely seashells, fashioning miraculous little brooches from tiny mussel and snail shells to while away their exile. The desert seashells were roughly 20,000 years old, from the vanished depths of the giant Pleistocene-era Lake Bonneville—the product of a jet stream diverted south by the ice sheet. This was once a Utahan Lake Superior, more than 1,000 feet deep in places. It was joined by endless other verdant lakes scattered across today’s bleak Basin and Range region. Elsewhere, the retreat of the seas made most of Indonesia a peninsula of mainland Asia. Vast savannas and swamps linked Australia and New Guinea, and of course Russia shared a tundra handshake with Alaska. There were reindeer in Spain, and glaciers in Morocco. And everywhere loess, loess, and more loess. This was the age of dust.

Ice is a rock that flows. Send it in massive sterilizing slabs across the continents, and it will quarry mountainsides, pulverize bedrock, and obliterate everything in its path. At the height of the last ice age, along the crumbling margins of the continental ice sheets, the rocky, dusty spoils of all this destruction spilled out onto the tundra. Dry winds carried this silt around the world in enormous dust storms, piling it up in seas of loess that buried the central U.S., China, and Eastern Europe under featureless drifts. In Austria, not far from the site of the voluptuous Venus of Willendorf figurine, carved some 30,000 years ago, are the remains of a campground of the same age—tents, hearths, burnt garbage pits, hoards of ivory jewelry—all abandoned in the face of these violent, smothering haboobs. Ice cores from both Antarctica and Greenland record a local environment that was 10 times dustier than today. All of this dust seeded the seas with iron, a vital nutrient for carbon-hogging plankton, which bloomed around Antarctica and pulled gigatons of CO 2 out of the air and deep into the ocean, freezing the planet further. Read: When a killer climate catastrophe struck the world’s oceans This parched Pleistocene world would have appeared duller from space, hosting as it did a quarter less plant life. CO 2 in the atmosphere registered only a paltry 180 ppm, less than half of what it is today. In fact, CO 2 was so low, it might have been unable to drop any further. Photosynthesis starts to shut down at such trifling levels, a negative-feedback effect that might have left more CO 2 —unused by plants—in the air above, acting as a brake on the deep freeze.

This was the strange world of the Ice Age, one that, geologically speaking, is still remarkably recent. It’s so recent, in fact, that today, most of Canada and Scandinavia is still bouncing back up from the now-vanished ice sheets that had weighed those lands down. The floods carried 30-foot boulders on biblical waves, through what were suddenly the world’s wildest rapids. In 2021, we find ourselves in an unusual situation: We live on a world with massive ice sheets, one of which covers one of the seven continents and is more than a mile deep. For most of the planet’s past, it has had virtually no ice whatsoever. The periods of extreme cold—like the ultra-ancient, phantasmagoric nightmares of Snowball Earth, when the oceans might have been smothered by ice sheets all the way to the tropics—are outliers. There were a few other surprising pulses of frost here and there, but they merely punctuate the balmy stretches of the fossil record. For almost all of the Earth’s history, the planet was a much warmer place than it is today, with much higher CO 2 levels. This is not a climate-denying talking point; it’s a physical fact, and acknowledging it does nothing to take away from the potential catastrophe of future warming. After all, we humans, along with everything else alive today, evolved to live in our familiar low-CO 2 world—a process that took a long time. How long, exactly? Fifty million years ago, as our tiny mammalian ancestors were still sweating through the jungly, high-CO 2 greenhouse climate they had inherited from the dinosaurs, India was nearing the end of an extended journey. Long estranged from Africa and the august, bygone supercontinent of Gondwana, the subcontinent raced northeast across the proto–Indian Ocean and smashed into Asia in slow motion. The collision not only quieted CO 2 -spewing volcanoes along Asian subduction zones; it also thrust the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau toward the stars, to be continually weathered and eroded away.

As it turns out, weathering rocks—that is, breaking them down with CO 2 -rich rainwater—is one of the planet’s most effective long-term mechanisms for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, one that modern geoengineers are frantically trying to reproduce in a lab, for obvious reasons. Adding to this colossal Himalayan CO 2 sink, the more recent buckling, tectonic mess that lifted Indonesia and its neighbors from the sea over the past 20 million years or so also exhumed vast tracts of highly weatherable ocean crust, exposing it all to the withering assault of tropical rainstorms. Today this corroding rock accounts for roughly 10 percent of the planet’s carbon sink. Over tens of millions of years, then, the stately march of plate tectonics—the balance of volcanic CO 2 and rock weathering—seems to have driven long-term climate change, in our case toward a colder, lower-CO 2 world. As we’ll see, humans now threaten to undo this entire epic, geologic-scale climate evolution of the Cenozoic era—and in only a few decades. When Earth’s blanket of CO 2 was finally thin enough, the planet’s regular wobbles were at long last sufficient to trigger deep glaciations. The ice ages began. But the climate was not stable during this period. The ice advanced and retreated, and while the descent into the wild episodes of the Pleistocene epoch could be leisurely—the depths of planetary winter taking tens of thousands of years to arrive—the leap out of the cold tended to be sudden and violent. This is where positive feedback loops come in: When the last ice age ended, it ended fast. Coral reefs marking the ancient sea level—but today lying deep off the coasts of Tahiti and Indonesia—reveal that about 14,500 years ago, the seas suddenly jumped 50 feet or so in only a few centuries, as meltwater from the late, great North American ice sheet raged down the Mississippi. When a 300-foot-deep lake of glacial meltwater spanning at least 80,000 square miles of central Canada catastrophically drained into the ocean, it shut down the churn of the North Atlantic and arrested the seaborne flow of heat northward. As a result, tundra advanced to retake much of Europe for 1,000 years. But when ocean circulation kicked back into gear, and the dense, salty seawater began to sink again, the system rebooted, and currents carried the equator’s heat toward the Arctic once more. Temperatures in Greenland suddenly leaped 10 degrees Celsius in perhaps a decade, fires spread, and revanchist forests reclaimed Europe for good.

In Idaho, ice dams that had held back giant lakes of glacial meltwater about six times the volume of Lake Erie collapsed as the world warmed, and each released 10 times the flow of all the rivers on Earth into eastern Washington. The floods carried 30-foot boulders on biblical waves, through what were suddenly the world’s wildest rapids. They left behind a labyrinth of bedrock-scoured canyons that still covers the entire southeastern corner of the state like a scar. When the Earth’s climate changes, this is what it can look like on the ground. As the ice sheets of the Northern Hemisphere finally lost their grip, darker land around the melting margins became exposed to the sun for the first time in 100,000 years, accelerating the ice’s retreat. Permafrost melted, and methane bubbled up from thawing bogs. Colder, more CO 2 -soluble oceans warmed, and gave up the carbon they’d stolen in the Ice Age, warming the Earth even more. Relieved of their glacial burden, volcanoes in Iceland, Europe, and California awoke, adding even more CO 2 to the atmosphere. Soon the Sahara would green again, Jericho would be born, and humans would start writing things down. They would do so with the assumption that the world they saw was the way it had always been. “We were born only yesterday and know nothing,” one of them would write. “And our days on earth are but a shadow.” As we leap back in time again, we emerge before the final Pleistocene glaciation. We’ve gone tremendously far back, 129,000 years, though in some ways we’ve only returned to our own world. This was the most recent interglacial period, the last of many breaks between the ice ages, and the last time the planet was roughly as warm as it is today. Once more, the seas have risen hundreds of feet, but something is awry.

As the Earth’s wobble and orbit conspired to melt more ice than the poles have shed so far today, the planet absorbed more sunlight. As a result, global temperatures were little more than 1 degree warmer than today’s Anthropocene chart-toppers—or maybe even the same. But sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is now. (A full third of Florida was sunk beneath the waves.) This is “sobering,” as one paper put it.

Modelers have tried and mostly failed to square how a world about as warm as today’s could produce seas so strangely high. Provisional, if nightmarish, explanations like the runaway, catastrophic collapse of monstrous ice cliffs more than 300 feet tall in Antarctica, which may or may not be set into motion in our own time, are fiercely debated in conference halls and geoscience departments. Very soon, we may well have warmed the planet enough to trigger similarly dramatic sea-level rise, even if it takes centuries to play out. This is what the Exxon scientist James Black meant in 1977 when he warned higher-ups of the coming “super-interglacial” that would be brought about—as a matter of simple atmospheric physics—from burning fossil fuels. But our trajectory as a civilization is headed well beyond the warmth of the last interglacial, or any other interglacial period of the Pleistocene, for that matter. So it’s time to keep moving. We must take our first truly heroic leap into geologic time, millions of years into the past.

We’re more than 3 million years in the past now, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is at 400 parts per million, a level the planet will not again see until September 2016. This world is 3 to 4 degrees Celsius warmer than ours, and the sea level is up to 80 feet higher. Stunted beech trees and bogs line the foothills of the Transantarctic Mountains not far from the South Pole—the last members of a venerable line of once-majestic forests that had existed since long before the age of the dinosaurs. What we’ve glossed over in our journey back to this ancient present: the entire evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, three Yellowstone super-eruptions, thousands of megafloods, the last of the giant terror birds, a mass extinction of whales, and the glacial creation and destruction of innumerable islands and moraines. As we make our way backwards in time to the Pliocene, the glaciations get briefer, and the ice sheets themselves become thinner and more temperamental. About 2.6 million years ago they all but disappear in North America, as CO 2 levels continue their slow climb. When we arrive in the middle of the Pliocene, just over 3 million years ago, CO 2 levels are high enough that we’ve escaped the cycle of ice ages and warm interglacials altogether. Lucy the Australopithecus roams a heavily forested East Africa. We are now outside the evolutionary envelope of our modern world, sculpted as it was by the temperamental northern ice sheets and deep freezes of the Pleistocene. But as to atmospheric carbon dioxide, 3 million years is how far back we have to go to arrive at an analogue for 2021.

Despite the similarities between our world and that of the Pliocene, the differences are notable. In the Canadian High Arctic—where today tundra spreads to the horizon—evergreen forests come right to the edge of an ice-free Arctic Ocean. Though the world as a whole is only a few degrees warmer, the Arctic, as always, gets the brunt of the extra heat. This is called “polar amplification,” and it’s why maps of modern warming are crowned by a disturbing fog of maroon. Models struggle to reproduce the extreme level of warming in the Pliocene Arctic. It’s a full 10 to 15 degrees Celsius warmer in the long twilight of northern Canada, and the pine and birch woodlands of these Arctic shores are filled with gigantic forest-dwelling camels. Occasionally this boreal world erupts in wildfire, a phenomenon echoed by the blazes that today sweep ever farther north. Elsewhere, West Antarctica’s ice sheet may have disappeared entirely, and Greenland’s, if it exists at all, is shriveled and pathetic. A common projection for our own warming world is that, while the wet places will get wetter, the dry places will get drier. But the Pliocene seems to defy this saw for reasons not yet fully understood. It’s a strangely wet world, especially the subtropics, where—in the Sahara, the Outback, the Atacama, the American Southwest, and Namibia—lakes, savannas, and woodlands replace deserts. This ancient wetness might come down to inadequacies in how we model clouds, which are under no obligation to behave in physical reality as they do in simplified lines of computer code. Hurricanes were almost certainly more consistently punishing 3 million years ago, just as our storms of the future will be. And a more sluggish circulation of the atmosphere might have lulled the trade winds, turning El Niño into “El Padre.” Perhaps this is what brought rains—and lakes—to the Mojave at this time. Our modern coastlines would have been so far underwater that you’d have to take great pains to avoid getting the bends if you tried scuba diving down to them. Today, traveling east through Virginia, or North or South Carolina, or Georgia, midway through your drive you’ll pass over a gentle 100-foot drop. This is the Orangeburg Scarp, a bluff—hundreds of miles long—that divides the broad, flat coastal plain of the American Southeast. It comprises the eroded and smoothed-out rumors of once-magnificent sea cliffs. Here, waves of the Pliocene high seas chewed away at the middle of the Carolinas—an East Coast Big Sur. This ancient shoreline is visible from space by the change in soil color that divides the states, and is visible on much closer inspection as well: To the east of this strange drop-off, giant megalodon-shark teeth and whale bones litter the Carolina Low Country. Though warped over the ages by the secret workings of the mantle far below, these subtle banks 90 miles inland nevertheless mark the highest shoreline of the Pliocene, when the seas were dozens of feet higher than they are today. But even within this warm Pliocene period, the sea level leaped and fell by as much as 60 feet every 20,000 years, to the rhythm of the Earth’s sway in space. This is because, under this higher-CO 2 regime, the unstable ice sheet in Antarctica took on the volatile temperament that, 1 million years later, would come to characterize North America’s ice sheet, toying with the ancient coastline as if it were a marionette.

So this is the Pliocene, the world of the distant present. While today’s projections of future warming tend to end in 2100, the Pliocene illuminates just what sort of long-term changes might inevitably be set in motion by the atmosphere we’ve already engineered. As the great ice sheets melt, the permafrost awakens, and darker forested land encroaches on the world’s tundra, positive feedbacks may eventually launch our planet into a different state altogether, one that might resemble this bygone world. Nevertheless, human civilization is unlikely to keep atmospheric CO 2 at a Pliocene level—so more ancient and extreme analogues must be retrieved. We’re now deeper in the past, and the planet appears truly exotic. The Amazon is running backwards, and gathers in great pools at the foot of the Andes. A seaway stretches from Western Europe to Kazakhstan and spills into the Indian Ocean. California’s Central Valley is open ocean. What today is the northwestern U.S. is especially unrecognizable. Today the airy, columnated canyons of the Columbia River in Oregon swarm with tiny kiteboarders zipping through gorges of basalt. But 16 million years ago, this was a black, unbreathable place, flowing with rivers of incandescent rock. The Columbia River basalts—old lava flows that spread across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, in some places more than two miles thick—were the creation of a class of extremely rare and world-changing volcanic eruptions known as large igneous provinces, or LIPs.

Some LIPs in Earth’s history span millions of square miles, erupt for millions of years, inject tens of thousands of gigatons of CO 2 into the air, and are responsible for most of the worst mass extinctions in the history of the planet. They live up to their name—they are large. But these mid-Miocene eruptions were still rather small as far as LIPs go, and so the planet was spared mass death. Nevertheless, the billowing volcanoes raised atmospheric CO 2 up to about 500 ppm, a level that today represents something close to the most ambitious and optimistic scenario possible for limiting our future carbon emissions.

Twitter’s India office suspended the magazine’s account, as well as those of hundreds of other users, after a “legal demand” from the government. (The Caravan’s account has since been restored, but the government is reportedly threatening legal action over Twitter's apparent noncompliance.) Press-freedom groups have voiced outrage, but it is unclear how much impact they will have.

These latest attacks, part of a pattern of legal cases, personal threats, and intimidation against news outlets and individual journalists, make certain what was becoming evident: The freedom of the press, a constitutional right, is endangered in Modi’s India. The brazen use of social-media networks to censor journalists, the use of the police and courts to silence them, and, more fundamentally, the belief that those who report on protests are somehow undermining the state illustrate how much has changed in India, and how far the country has strayed from its founding ideals.

The authorities claim that The Caravan and other outlets, by reporting on a particular hashtag, sparked or fueled unrest that began on January 26, India’s Republic Day, during which New Delhi police tear-gassed protesting farmers—among them elderly men—as a parade was under way to showcase India’s military might and rich cultural heritage.

The dueling images—a celebration of India’s democracy on the one hand, the crushing of dissent on the other—were carried on a split screen by many news channels, inadvertently offering the perfect visual metaphor for modern India.

Read: How Hinduism became a political weapon in India

To outsiders, the idea of India is centered on spirituality and mysticism, Gandhi and nonviolence, backpackers and yogis. Though these are stereotypical beliefs, they stem from truth: The country’s founding idea was a union of states, diverse in religion, and liberal in acceptance of that diversity. Republic Day marks the enshrining of our constitution, debated and agreed on in the years following independence. The preamble of that document notes India’s “resolve to constitute” a nation with “Justice in social, economic and political life; Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; Equality of status and of opportunity, and to promote among them all, Fraternity.”

This was the central ethos of India once.

Now we are a very different country. Today, that a majority of Indians are Hindu is not a demographic fact, but a governing premise; whereas liberty of thought was once prized, journalists are now arrested; and what was once a union of states, united in their diversity, is a society divided, where Muslims are not welcome, where farmers are beaten for defending their rights.",The End of the Indian Idea

The researchers write that their finding is a “small” effect, but still significant, considering that “there are a slew of other variables that play into people’s overall assessment of their satisfaction in life.”

An experiment that the researchers arranged hinted at a possible explanation of the correlation they found. They asked participants to picture and describe what it would be like to have a certain amount of daily free time, and then report how they’d feel about that allotment. “What we find is that having too little time makes people feel stressed, and maybe that’s obvious,” says Holmes. “But interestingly, that effect goes away—the role of stress goes away—once you approach the optimal point.” After that point, Holmes says, the subjects started to say they felt less productive overall, which could explain why having a lot of free time can feel like having too much free time.

It’s not clear what an individual is to do with these findings, since the amount of free time people have usually has to do with a variety of factors, such as having children or a degree of control over work schedules. That said, Holmes told me that she shared her research with the MBA students in her class on happiness, and some of the most time-crunched among them were comforted by the findings: “I think that two and a half hours creates a nice goal that, even if you increase a little bit more of your discretionary time use, you [can expect] that it will translate into greater life satisfaction.”

Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies time use, said it can be difficult to suss out the relationship between free time and life satisfaction. For one thing, some of the data analyzed in the paper was obtained by asking people to estimate how much free time they have, and those estimates can be unreliable. For another, it’s difficult to systematically say what qualifies as “discretionary” time and what doesn’t. “Every minute we have is subject to choice one way or the other, consciously or not,” he notes.

While Hamermesh didn’t inspect the underlying data in the paper, he offered a couple of possible (but, he notes, hard-to-test) explanations for the findings. “Let’s say everybody around me has two hours of discretionary time, and for some reason I have four,” he says. “I have no friends to play with”—his point being that people’s free time might be less fulfilling if they can’t spend it with others.

Another theory: Having too much free time might challenge a person’s self-image. For a man who provides for his family, Hamermesh says, “if I have so much time that I can spend it on, I don’t know, watching television, maybe I feel I’m not a real man.” (This feeling could be related to the pressure many people feel to appear useful and in demand as they vie for work in a competitive labor market.)",How Much Leisure Time Do the Happiest People Have?

But as we barrel toward the first anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, the physical consequences of extended disruption, isolation, and stress have begun to make themselves known en masse, in doctors’ offices and telehealth video calls. The coronavirus itself, of course, has had a devastating impact on the physical health of millions of Americans. But even for those who have avoided the virus so far, the by-products of living through an extended disaster have often been painful; for some, they’ve been catastrophic. Even if you don’t get COVID-19, the pandemic might destroy you anyway.

It’s too early for expansive data on how (and how much) people were hurting in 2020, but according to doctors and health-care workers, some clear trends have emerged, and the complaints stretch to the far reaches of the human body. Among the earliest and most enduring have been the type I’ve experienced—aches and pains that emerge without obvious injury, then stick around. “By May, I was seeing a lot more neck and upper back pain, also accompanied with headache,” Jaspal Singh, a pain- and rehabilitation-medicine specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told me in an email. These problems have since taken over Singh’s practice—he estimated that before the pandemic, 70 percent of his patients were complaining of lower-back and leg pain. Now more than half have the kinds of aches that come from hours at ad hoc workstations—curving your shoulders forward, jutting your head out in front of your body to look at a laptop whose screen is too low, and maintaining that position for hours at a time, all while sitting in a chair meant to support a human for the duration of a meal, not a workday.

And people aren’t just working in more challenging physical circumstances; they’re also spending more time doing it. “In the office, people work for eight or nine hours, but now they find themselves working 10 or 12 hours at home just because there’s no commute time,” Natalia Ruiz, a physical therapist at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center, told me of her patients. “Expectations of productivity have increased because you’re working from home.” In her practice, she’s seen more complaints of back and neck pain, but also more “repetitive strain” injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis in the hands and forearms, and pinched nerves in the elbows.

Read: Isolation is changing how you look

The circumstances of work have changed in some way for millions of Americans, whether that has meant working from home, working longer and more physically punishing hours, or being laid off and largely stuck at home to job-search online. The problems emerging in doctors’ offices are mostly those bothering people who can work from home, because, among other reasons, their jobs are more likely to offer health insurance and time off to seek care than those held by essential workers. People who suddenly shifted to working from home were caught without the basic ergonomic equipment found in many offices, such as adjustable-height desk chairs and laptop stands that can raise screens up to eye level. Some people cobbled together healthier setups as it became clearer how long they would be out of the office, but for many who have lost work or taken pay cuts, spending hundreds of dollars on equipment isn’t feasible. For those living in cramped housing with kids who go to Zoom school and other family members who also need space to work, building a personal mini office simply isn’t an option.","Yes, the Pandemic Is Ruining Your Body"

This article was published online on February 6, 2021. Last February, on a sunny afternoon in West Hollywood, two girls with precise eye makeup paused on Melrose Avenue and peered in the windows of a building whose interior was painted a bright, happy pink. Two pink, winged unicorns flanked racks of clothes: ribbed crop tops, snakeskin-print pants, white sleeveless bodysuits. One of the girls tugged on the door, then frowned. It was locked, which was weird. She tugged again. Inside, a broad-chested security guard regarded them impassively from behind a pink security desk. Erin Cullison, the U.S. public-relations rep for PrettyLittleThing, a fast-fashion brand founded in 2012, watched the girls give up and walk away. She sighed. Although the West Hollywood showroom closely resembles a store, it is not, in fact, a store. It is not open to the public; the clothes on the racks don’t have price tags. “People try to give us cash, but we’re not even set up to take money,” Cullison told me. Instead, the clientele is made up of the brand’s influencer partners—thousands of them—who can make an appointment to visit the showroom every couple of weeks and “get gifted.” They try on the latest styles and take advantage of various “photo moments”: lounging on the plush pink couch, posing on the pink staircase, peeking out of the London phone booth repainted—yes—pink. They can snack on a pink-frosted cupcake, and (provided they’re 21 or older) drink a glass of rosé at the store’s pink bar, before heading home with several items of free clothing.

PrettyLittleThing is part of the Boohoo Group, a company that has become a dominant force in retail fashion over the past decade; along with several other aggressive and like-minded companies, it is quickly reshaping the industry. Boohoo stock is now publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: BOO), but it started as a family business. As the legend goes, the family patriarch, Abdullah Kamani, immigrated to the U.K. from Kenya in the 1960s and began selling handbags from a street stand. Eventually, he opened a textile factory that supplied the retailers that, starting in the 1990s, shook the fashion world with their cheap clothes and high merchandise turnover: H&M, Topshop, and the Irish fast-fashion juggernaut Primark. Abdullah’s business was successful enough that he bought himself a Rolls-Royce; his son Mahmud saw the potential for even greater profits. In 2006, Mahmud and his business partner, Carol Kane, began selling cheap clothes directly to consumers through Boohoo.com. Without the burden of retail stores, the company’s costs were relatively low, except when it came to marketing. Young girls who went on YouTube (and, later, Instagram) were inundated with microtargeted ads for Boohoo bodysuits and minidresses. Boohoo’s founders understood that social media could be leveraged to make new brands quickly seem ubiquitous to their target audience. “If you have that imagery out there you are perceived as a much larger business than you actually are,” Kane told the trade publication Drapers.

Social media wasn’t just a convenient place to advertise—it was also changing how we think about our clothes. Fashion brands have always played on our aspirations and insecurities, and on the seemingly innate desire to express ourselves through our clothing. Now those companies had access to their target shoppers not just when they stood below a billboard in SoHo or saw an ad on prime-time TV, but in more intimate spaces and at all hours of the day. Brands flooded our feeds with their wares, whether through their own channels or, more surreptitiously, by enlisting influencers to make an item seem irresistible, or at least unavoidable. The more we began documenting our own lives for public consumption, meanwhile, the more we became aware of ourselves (and our clothing) being seen. Young people, and young women in particular, came to feel an unspoken obligation not to repeat an #outfitoftheday; according to a 2017 poll, 41 percent of women ages 18 to 25 felt pressure to wear a different outfit every time they went out. Two decades ago, Zara was revolutionary for offering hundreds of new items a week; nowadays, Asos adds as many as 7,000. Boohoo’s founders understood that the company had to hustle to keep customers’ attention—to “be fresh all the time,” as Kane has put it. “A traditional retailer might buy three or four styles, but we’ll buy 25,” Kane told The Guardian in 2014. Not having to keep hundreds of stores stocked meant Boohoo could be flexible about inventory management. In 2018, H&M was sitting on $4.3 billion worth of unsold items. Boohoo, by contrast, could order as few as 300 or 500 units of a given style—just enough to see whether it would catch on. Only about a quarter of the initial styles were reordered, according to Kane.

Over time, Boohoo accumulated rich data about online consumer behavior, and further tailored the shopping experience to its shoppers’ tastes. “They know that first-time customers like to see this product category, or customers from this geographic area like this color palette,” Matt Katz, a managing partner at the consulting firm SSA & Company, told me. In normal times, Boohoo’s agility and ingenuity offered crucial advantages over the competition. When the pandemic hit, those advantages became decisive. In 2015, when Tricia Panlaqui was 12, she pretended she was 13 so she could start an Instagram account, where she posted videos of herself doing the kinds of things that 12-year-olds do: cartwheeling, blowing kisses at the camera, putting on makeup. By her 15th birthday, she had moved on to what she felt was a more grown-up medium—YouTube—and focused her content on fashion. When she posted haul videos, a YouTube genre that’s a combination of an unboxing and a bedroom fashion show, her viewership skyrocketed. Brands began reaching out, offering her sponsorship deals. In Tricia’s earliest videos, her outfits had mostly come from familiar mall stores: a white sweater from Express, distressed denim cutoffs from American Eagle. But once she hit 10,000 followers, her channel began to feature clothes from a different set of brands, ones that were typically online-only and based in China. There was Shein, which sells $10 bathing suits, and Zaful, where the prices were even lower. These companies had cropped up alongside lesser-known brands whose names tend to be two words awkwardly jammed together: DressLily, NastyDress, TwinkleDeals, TrendsGal, FairySeason. You wouldn’t find their goods at the mall or see them advertised on TV, but if you were a young woman between the ages of 12 and 22 on social media, their targeted ads were inescapable.

When Tricia agreed to make a video featuring a company’s products, she would typically receive a few hundred dollars’ worth of free merchandise. The product quality could be iffy, but the clothes were cheap and abundant—which meant she could make more haul videos. Related Stories Where Does Discarded Clothing Go?

Fashion’s Racism and Classism Are Finally Out of Style There was nothing particularly groundbreaking about Tricia’s fashion sense, or her online persona. She liked iced vanilla lattes from Starbucks and leggings from Lululemon. But she had warm, wide eyes, and she spoke to the camera in a friendly, direct way. The more content she made about shopping, the more views—and ad revenue—she earned. The year Tricia turned 16, she made nearly $40,000 from ad revenue, sponsorships, and commissions; to celebrate her birthday, she showed off her purchases from a shopping spree that had cost her $3,000—all money she had made through her YouTube channel. Once Tricia surpassed 100,000 followers—a key metric for YouTube influencers—she began getting offers from better-known fast-fashion brands, including Boohoo, as well as other companies that were following its digital-first model, such as Princess Polly and Fashion Nova. To Tricia, sometimes these companies all seemed to be copying one another. Someone would send her a loose tie-front tank top, and then a few days later four other brands would deliver their versions of the same style. She soon had more clothes than she knew what to do with. She gave them to friends and charities and thrift stores; she sold them on the social-shopping app Depop and ran giveaways for her followers. Her closet still overflowed with outfits, so she stuffed the excess into suitcases.

Read: All your clothes are made with exploited labor Working with these brands gave her some pause. Cheap clothes come with severe environmental consequences, and this troubled Tricia. (Her sponsors were self-conscious about this too—she says they asked her to hide the plastic packaging their clothes came in so it wouldn’t be visible in the videos.) The industry’s labor practices are also suspect, and commenters chided her for working with companies that had terrible track records. She temporarily cut ties with Shein after it was accused of using child labor in its factories. “But as sad as it is, every brand is doing some type of thing,” she told me. “You’d have to cancel every single brand.” PrettyLittleThing When the coronavirus arrived, Tricia was worried—with the world falling apart, would anyone care about shopping? Clothing retailers were among the hardest hit by the pandemic. In April, U.S. clothing sales plummeted by 79 percent from March; McKinsey predicted that global fashion-industry revenues would contract by 30 percent in 2020. Brands like Primark were saddled with what one industry observer called an “inventory crisis”—billions of dollars of merchandise intended for now-closed shops. With less inventory and no brick-and-mortar stores, Boohoo and its competitors had no such drag on their operations. Quick to pivot, the brands sent Tricia sweatpants and hoodies and suggested themes for her videos: Corona style! Lounging at home! Even with the economy in free fall, demand for cheap, cute clothes persisted.

In times of crisis, consumers don’t stop shopping—they just limit their purchases to affordable pleasures. Fast fashion had expanded its market share during the 2008 global financial crisis; now this new cohort of companies—known as ultra-fast fashion—was poised to do the same. While the rest of the retail sector struggled and legacy companies such as J.Crew and Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy, many of Tricia’s sponsors and their rivals thrived. Asos’s sales rose rapidly from March to June. Boohoo had its best quarter ever. “We’ve seen an incredible sprint to digital,” Matt Katz told me. “What would’ve taken seven years has taken seven months—or seven weeks.” Boohoo’s clothes may not feature prominently in Vogue photo shoots, and may, for now, appeal to customers who are mostly under the age of 30. But the rise of ultra-fast fashion marks a major shift in the retail world. Two decades ago, the first fast-fashion companies redrew the lines of a staid industry. Now their faster, cheaper successors are upending it. In the process, they are changing our relationship to shopping, to our clothes, and even to our planet. Back when going to the mall was still a possibility, Tricia filmed another video. She held up a yellow plastic bag from a former fast-fashion powerhouse, Forever 21. “I normally don’t go there and, like, buy clothes there … but our store was 70 percent off so I was like, ‘Okay,’ ” she said, sounding skeptical.

For those of us who grew up haunting the food courts of suburban malls, Forever 21 was once the epitome of fast fashion. When the company filed for bankruptcy in 2019, some interpreted it as the end of an era. If Millennials killed homeownership, golf, and department stores, perhaps Generation Z consumers, who claimed to prize sustainability and transparency, would be the death of fast fashion. In study after study, young shoppers said they preferred eco-friendly products from socially conscious companies; surely they wouldn’t support an industry notorious for its alarming environmental toll and history of exploiting workers. But that isn’t exactly what happened. Read: Forever 21 underestimated young women When Forever 21 (then known as Fashion 21) opened its first store—in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, in 1984—the majority of the clothes bought in the U.S. were still produced domestically, and most fashion brands released new styles seasonally. “Your mom took you shopping at the beginning of the school year. You got two pairs of jeans, and maybe if you were really lucky, you could squeeze a dress out of her,” recalls Aja Barber, a writer and fashion-sustainability consultant. Americans now buy a piece of clothing every five days, on average. But macro-level changes were transforming the industry. Synthetic fibers made it possible to manufacture cheaper (and in many cases less durable) clothes; new trade policies led to a globalized supply chain. Companies shifted production offshore, where environmental regulations were less stringent, or nonexistent, and garment workers sometimes earned 20 times less than in the U.S. Clothing got massively cheaper.

Forever 21, which initially catered to L.A.’s Korean community, set itself apart by offering a steady flow of new merchandise that capitalized on emerging styles. As it grew, its co-founder Jin Sook Chang reviewed as many as 400 new designs a day. Shopping for fast fashion was exciting—there was always something new, and the merchandise was so cheap that you could easily justify an impulse buy. While high-end fashion companies were still releasing fall and spring collections, Forever 21’s rival Zara offered fresh styles twice a week. The company, which prefers to distance itself from the “fast fashion” label, says it was just trying to respond to customers’ desires. But stocking inexpensive, ever-changing options also stimulated our desire to buy more. If you found a look you liked at Zara, you had to snap it up right away, or else suffer from fashion FOMO. One study found that, whereas the average shopper visited any given store about four times a year, Zara shoppers stopped in once every three weeks. Traditional brands initially scoffed at fast fashion, but they also feared losing market share; they, too, began shifting manufacturing overseas and releasing items more frequently. The 2008 financial crisis further cemented fast fashion’s hold on the market. If you were going to a job interview while the economy collapsed around you, a $25 Forever 21 blazer was hard to beat. Even after the economy recovered, people kept buying inexpensive clothes, and in ever-larger quantities. Worldwide, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015, while prices dropped: We were spending the same amount on clothes, but getting nearly twice as many items for it. At its peak, in 2015, Forever 21 made $4.4 billion in global sales.

It’s hard to overstate how much and how quickly fast fashion altered our relationship with clothing, conditioning us to believe that our clothes should be cheap, abundant, and new. Trends used to take a year to pass from the runway to the mainstream; now the fashion cycle has become so compressed that it takes just a few weeks, or even less. Americans buy a piece of clothing every five days, on average, and we pay so little for our garments that we’ve come to think of them as disposable. According to a McKinsey study, for every five new garments produced each year, three garments are disposed of. Read: The power of buying less by buying better Like many retail brands, Forever 21 was hit hard by the shift to online shopping. While other companies invested in their e-commerce platforms, Forever 21 doubled down on brick-and-mortar retail, signing leases in malls that were steadily losing foot traffic. When shoppers did visit stores, they found a retailer that was out of touch with the times. In 2015, two-thirds of teenage girls in the U.S. identified as “special size”—plus, petite, tall—but mall shops were slow to respond to this reality. Not all Forever 21 stores had a plus-size section; when the fashion blogger known as Fat Girl Flow visited one that did, in 2016, she found it “tiny [and] dimly lit with yellow lights, no mirrors, and zero accessories on the shelves.” By contrast, many of the ultra-fast-fashion brands that were arriving on the scene featured thick-thighed models in minidresses and lingerie. PrettyLittleThing has made a point of embracing body positivity—prominently featuring models with stretch marks, models with vitiligo, models with colostomy bags. And while the ultra-fast-fashion companies were partnering with girls like Tricia, as late as 2017 Forever 21 was still spending nearly half its marketing budget on radio ads.

The companies that once shocked the industry with their speed no longer seemed quite so fast. Two decades ago, Zara was revolutionary for offering hundreds of new items a week; nowadays, Asos adds as many as 7,000 new styles to its website over the same period. Fast-fashion companies used to brag about getting a new style up for sale in as little as two weeks. Boohoo can do it in a matter of days. Boohoo’s profits doubled in 2017. They doubled again in 2018. Meanwhile, the third generation of the Kamani family was making inroads in the fashion business. Umar, Mahmud’s son, had founded PrettyLittleThing when he was 24. Now he was turning it into Boohoo’s splashier little sister. The clothes were bolder (more body-con dresses, more crop tops, more metallics) and the branding was emphatically pinker. PrettyLittleThing’s branding reflects Umar’s flashy persona. On Instagram, where he has 1 million followers, he’s posted photos of himself posing with Drake, sunbathing in the Maldives, and Jet Skiing behind a yacht. He hosted J.Lo’s 50th birthday party at Gloria Estefan’s house, and claims to FaceTime with will.i.am nearly every day. The first generation of fast-fashion brands still tends to take its cues from traditional gatekeepers. Ultra-fast-fashion companies more often look to celebrity culture. Sometimes, this takes the form of partnerships: PLT has produced lines with Kourtney Kardashian; Fashion Nova has linked up with Cardi B. Other times, though, ultra-fast-fashion companies simply copy the looks of these and other stars. In 2019, Kim Kardashian posted a picture of herself in her closet wearing a tight gold dress with a midriff cutout. “Fast fashion brands, can you please wait until I wear this in real life before you knock it off?” she pleaded in the caption. Within hours, one company, Missguided, posted an extremely similar outfit on its Instagram page, promising to have the dress for sale within a few days. (Kardashian sued the company for copying her looks and was granted $2.7 million in damages.)

PLT’s aesthetic may be as celebrity-obsessed as its founder, but the real force behind its social-media marketing are the thousands of Bachelor contestants, TikTokers, Instagram models, and YouTubers like Tricia who have been enlisted to post about the brand. Studies show that the more we use social media, the more time and money we spend shopping online. Following influencers correlates with even more shopping. In 2017, data from the social-media-analytics company Hitwise showed that PLT was the most popular emerging fast-fashion brand, with a 663 percent rise in traffic to its online store since 2014. From 2016 to 2019, the company’s annual sales went from about $23 million to nearly $510 million. Still, in training consumers to look for the shiniest, newest style, companies like PrettyLittleThing might be establishing the conditions for their own obsolescence. Today’s young shoppers have little brand loyalty. Consider Nasty Gal, which was once heralded as the “fastest growing retailer” of 2012 by Inc. magazine. Within a few years it filed for bankruptcy—and was bought by the Boohoo Group, which cut prices and closed the brand’s remaining brick-and-mortar stores. “Pre-COVID, not only were consumers buying and wearing things for a shorter amount of time, but they were also constantly looking for newness, which had been accelerating the cycle by which individual brands come in and out of favor,” says Adheer Bahulkar, a partner and retail specialist at the global consulting firm Kearney. “The sheer amount of newness in the market makes it difficult for any given brand to keep up.” About two miles away from PrettyLittleThing’s showroom, a line formed outside another West Hollywood storefront. The occasion was the annual sample sale at Dolls Kill, a mass-market brand dedicated to selling nonconformism. On the surface, Dolls Kill looks like the polar opposite of PrettyLittleThing; whereas PLT is all about converging on the trends of the moment, Dolls Kill shoppers identify as misfits and dress accordingly. But the companies are banking on similar strategies to keep young shoppers coming back: aggressive online engagement, an abundance of styles, and unrelenting newness.

Dolls Kill is where you go when you want to buy neon platform combat boots or a pair of shimmery, iridescent bell-bottoms. There’s a dash of mall-goth in its aesthetic, alongside some anime-inspired hyperfemininity and raver psychedelia. Despite—or perhaps because of—its outsider cachet, Dolls Kill has attracted attention from powerful venture-capital investors. Amy Sun, then a partner at Sequoia Capital, a major Dolls Kill investor, surveyed the hundreds of shoppers clamoring to get inside the sample sale: their Billie Eilish neon-streaked hair, their skeleton-print hoodies. From inside the store, club music pulsed hypnotically. “You can feel the brand magic,” Sun said. “Which is super hard to build.” Dolls Kill’s founders, Shaudi Lynn and Bobby Farahi, met at a rave. She was a DJ; he had recently sold his media company and was “partying,” he later told Inc. Farahi was impressed with Lynn’s fashion sense, and business acumen. She would buy something cute on eBay for $5, then turn around and sell it for $100. “She looked for items that were hard to find, that were viral in nature—items that made people say, ‘Hey, where did you get that?’ ” Farahi said. Lynn and Farahi began dating, and launched an online boutique in 2012. Lynn chose the name Dolls Kill because she liked the way the two words sounded together—one soft, one hard. At first, they imagined that Dolls Kill would be a niche brand, popular mostly with club kids. But then something started to shift—the Burning Man aesthetic was creeping into the workaday world; festival culture went mainstream. Word began to circulate: If you wanted your #ootd to be colorful and weird and stand out on social media, Dolls Kill was a good place to shop.

In the age of the fickle consumer, one strategy is to make customers feel like part of a community. Dolls Kill proved adept at this. “All the models on our sites are customers who submitted photos of themselves. They are just ecstatic, and they become evangelists,” Farahi has said. In 2018, the company opened its flagship Los Angeles store. It was designed to look like an industrial nightclub, with raw-concrete floors, exposed-brick walls, and an Italian sound system the company referred to in a press release as “insane.” The stores are less a revenue generator than a way to reinforce that feeling of community, Farahi told me: “Are they here to shop, or are they here to meet other people, hang out, be part of a movement?”

In 2014, Dolls Kill attracted $5 million in an initial round of funding led by Maveron, the venture-capital firm co-founded by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; five years later, the company raised another $40 million in a second round. That round was headed by Sequoia, which thinks Dolls Kill has the potential to be a “generation defining” brand, Sun told me. Rebellion against the mass market had mass-market appeal, she believed. “The age of conformity is over,” she said. “Anytime I wear anything from them, people are like, where did you get that?”

Despite its aggressive attitude, Dolls Kill has its own network of influencers and brand ambassadors, just as its more conformist peers do. The first day of the sample sale was invitation-only; the room was full of Dolls Kill superfans, but also influencers like Jake Fleming, a lithe, blond fashion YouTuber in his early 20s. He told me that he liked Dolls Kill just fine—its clothes photographed well and he always wore them to Coachella—but attending this event was basically work for him. “We went to a brand party before this, and we have two more brand parties tomorrow,” he said, a hint of fatigue evident in his voice. The Dolls Kill sample sale was one of the last times I was in a crowded room. A month later, when most of the country shut down, I spent many hours scrolling through online stores—not so much buying but browsing. PrettyLittleThing had hundreds of leggings listed on its website, and I looked at all of them: white faux leather, flame-print mesh, seamless gray ombré. Dolls Kill was featuring velour tracksuits in candy-colored tones. The browsing suited my mood of low-key dissatisfaction, the itchy, procrastination-prone state that one of my friends calls “snacky.” I had a closet full of clothes and nowhere to wear them, but I added items to my basket anyway—improbable outfits for imaginary parties in a world that no longer existed.

The ultra-fast-fashion brands have designed a shopping experience that makes the consumer feel as if the clothes magically appear out of nowhere, with easy purchasing and near-immediate delivery. The frictionless transactions contribute to the sense that the products themselves are ephemeral—easy come, easy go. The volume of clothes Americans throw away has doubled over the past 20 years. Of course, the clothes don’t come from nowhere. Ultra-fast fashion brings with it steep environmental costs. “You may get a $1 bikini,” Dana Thomas, the author of the 2019 book Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes, told me. “But it’s costing society a lot. We’re paying for all of this in different ways.” Producing clothing at this scale and speed requires expending enormous amounts of natural resources. Cotton is a thirsty crop; according to Tatiana Schlossberg, the author of Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don’t Know You Have (2019), producing a pound of it can require 100 times more water than producing a pound of tomatoes. But synthetic textiles have their own problems, environmentally speaking. They’re a major source of the microplastics that clog our waterways and make their way into our seafood. McKinsey has estimated that the fashion industry is responsible for 4 percent of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions; the United Nations says it accounts for 20 percent of global wastewater.

But domestic manufacturing doesn’t necessarily mean ethical manufacturing. Several of Fashion Nova’s Los Angeles–based suppliers were investigated by the Department of Labor for paying wages as low as $2.77 an hour. (Fashion Nova now mandates that all contractors and subcontractors pay minimum wage.) Reporters in the U.K. have uncovered disturbing practices at Boohoo’s suppliers, including impossible quotas, unsafe working conditions, and garment workers paid well below the minimum wage. Fast-fashion companies typically outsource production to a long chain of contractors and subcontractors, making accountability a challenge. Eventually, Tricia started shooting Shein haul videos again, after the company posted a self-exonerating explication of its labor practices on its website. But fast-fashion influencers, like fast-fashion consumers, have little insight into supply chains that are kept intentionally opaque. Last spring, as the coronavirus tore across Europe, Boohoo and other fast-fashion brands kept distribution centers open. Workers told labor advocates that social distancing was impossible, and that they were expected to bring their own hand sanitizer. By late June, Leicester, the U.K.’s textile-manufacturing hub, had an infection rate three times higher than that of any other city in the country. (Boohoo has since pledged to make its supply chains public and require third-party suppliers to adhere to ethical guidelines.)",Ultra-fast Fashion Is Eating the World

Pretty good friends with whom I had mostly done things that were no longer possible, such as trying new restaurants together. Co-workers I didn’t know well but chatted with in the communal kitchen. Workers at the local coffee or sandwich shops who could no longer dawdle to chat. The depth and intensity of these relationships varied greatly, but these people were all, in some capacity, my friends, and there was also no substitute for them during the pandemic. Tools like Zoom and FaceTime, useful for maintaining closer relationships, couldn’t re-create the ease of social serendipity, or bring back the activities that bound us together.

Understandably, much of the energy directed toward the problems of pandemic social life has been spent on keeping people tied to their families and closest friends. These other relationships have withered largely unremarked on after the places that hosted them closed. The pandemic has evaporated entire categories of friendship, and by doing so, depleted the joys that make up a human life—and buoy human health. But that does present an opportunity. In the coming months, as we begin to add people back into our lives, we’ll now know what it’s like to be without them.

American culture does not have many words to describe different levels or types of friendship, but for our purposes, sociology does provide a useful concept: weak ties. The term was coined in 1973 by the Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter, and it comprises acquaintances, people you see infrequently, and near strangers with whom you share some familiarity. They’re the people on the periphery of your life—the guy who’s always at the gym at the same time as you, the barista who starts making your usual order while you’re still at the back of the line, the co-worker from another department with whom you make small talk on the elevator. They’re also people you might have never directly met, but you share something important in common—you go to the same concerts, or live in the same neighborhood and frequent the same local businesses. You might not consider all of your weak ties friends, at least in the common use of the word, but they’re often people with whom you’re friendly. Most people are familiar with the idea of an inner circle; Granovetter posited that we also have an outer circle, vital to our social health in its own ways.

During the past year, it’s often felt like the pandemic has come for all but the closest of my close ties. There are people on the outer periphery of my life for whom the concept of “keeping up” makes little sense, but there are also lots of friends and acquaintances—people I could theoretically hang out with outdoors or see on videochat, but with whom those tools just don’t feel right. In my life, this perception seems to be largely mutual—I am not turning down invites from these folks for Zoom catch-ups and walks in the park. Instead, our affection for each other is in a period of suspended animation, alongside indoor dining and international travel. Sometimes we respond to each other’s Instagram Stories.",The Pandemic Has Erased Entire Categories of Friendship

The situation defies expert expectations about how immunity would help protect the hardest-hit populations. By estimates of leading infectious-disease specialists, such as Anthony Fauci, when roughly 70 to 75 percent of the population is immune, there can still be clusters of cases, but sustaining a large-scale outbreak becomes mathematically impossible. Still somehow, according to The Washington Post, hospitals in Manaus that had thought they were well prepared are now overwhelmed.

Though many questions remain, one plausible explanation is that people who have already been infected by the virus are getting sick—and not mildly so. That possibility has been long feared throughout the pandemic, yet not previously seen on any significant scale. It comes at a time when variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being identified around the world, including a report in Minnesota of a case of the variant that has become dominant in Brazil. Although no known variants have been found to pose an immediate threat to vaccinated people, the capacity for reinfection to any significant degree would reshape the pandemic’s trajectory.

Two important factors seem to be playing a role in Brazil’s resurgence. The first is that, after a COVID-19 infection, the natural immunity that our bodies develop seems to vary in strength and permanence. Protection wanes after infection with most respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that health-care workers in the U.K. had very low rates of repeated infection in the first six months after getting COVID-19, but cases did occur. Other studies have found that antibodies in our blood decrease over time, so people who were infected last year may now be experiencing declines in immunity. The new wave of COVID-19 cases in Manaus occurred about eight months after the initial wave. People might have lost some degree of immunity during that window.

Read: Immunology is where intuition goes to die

But that’s likely only part of the picture. The second factor is the virus itself. Several newsworthy variants exist, including those in the U.K., South Africa, and California. (So it’s easy to lose track, as much alarm has been raised over their various mutations.) But the variant in Brazil, known as the P.1 (or B.1.1.248) lineage, has a potent combination of mutations. Not only does this variant seem to be more transmissible; its lineage carries mutations that help it escape the antibodies that we develop in response to older lineages of the coronavirus. That is, it at least has a capacity to infect people who have already recovered from COVID-19, even if their defenses protect them against other versions of the virus.

She took a few steps onto the ice … and kept going. About 15 miles later, the 70-pound wolf who sported a distinctive black fur mantle across the back of her tan coat, stepped onto the Canadian mainland, her GPS tracking collar showed.

And with that one freezing, unexpected walk on Jan. 31 2019, the wolf known as W003F largely took herself out of the world’s longest predator-prey study that’s been going on for decades on Isle Royale.

The wolf had been captured in nearby Minnesota in the fall of 2018, and spent nearly four months on the island archipelago before trotting back to the mainland. Of the nearly 20 wolves who have been captured and brought to the island as part of an ambitious National Park Service project to resurrect viable wolf packs there and thin the moose population, W003F has been the only wolf to use an ice bridge as an escape route.

Even though she was no longer a prime part of the island’s wolf project – no one was tracking her to see which wolves she traveled with or if she mated and had pups – researchers for the last two years have been keeping an eye on this wolf’s distant movements through her radio collar. And what they’ve seen has really surprised them.

“She’s crossed a lot of borders,” said Beth Orning, a postdoctoral research scientist who until recently worked on the Isle Royale project as part of the Global Wildlife Conservation Center through the State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry.

A plot of W003F’s radio-tracked movements show that once the wolf reached the Canadian mainland in early 2019, she traveled back into Minnesota – near the area of her capture – and stayed there for about a month. “She continued traveling around Minnesota and into Ontario, Canada, until deciding to remain in Ontario from July to September 2019. From September to October 2019, wolf 003F ventured back to Grand Portage Reservation (in Minnesota) for a month. This stay was brief before she traveled back up to Ontario. Although she has spent most of her time in Ontario since October 2019, she did make two excursions to Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota during February and March 2020,” study staff said. Her journey has covered thousands of miles.

All this long-distance roaming makes her a rare wolf, scientists say. Most wolves travel to find a mate or join an existing pack. But W003F’s preference to be on the move and cover a lot of ground is not something researchers see every day. “The total amount of distance and where she traveled, it’s in the rare spectrum,” said Orning, one of the authors of a scientific paper published recently, entitled “Emigration and First-Year Movements of Initial Wolf Translocations to Isle Royale.”

BROUGHT OVER ON A BOAT

The female wolf started her journey to become W003F on Sept. 29, 2018, when research documents show she was captured using a foothold trap while walking within the Grand Portage Reservation in northeastern Minnesota. She was one of a handful of wolves captured there. Some were destined to head to Isle Royale, while others were deemed unsuitable for the project and released. “In each area, we pre-baited sites with nuisance beaver and vehicle-killed white-tailed deer carcasses to facilitate captures,” project staff wrote.

W003F taking her first step out of her crate onto Isle Royale in October 2018.

Once this particular wolf was caught, researchers determined her age and physical condition made her a good fit for relocation to Isle Royale. After her vet check, she received a round of vaccinations, ear tags and a GPS collar. With that, she became W003F. On Oct. 2, she was loaded into a large metal crate, which was covered with a tarp and lifted onto the Beaver, a National Park Service boat, for the trip to the island. Once there, her crate was moved from the boat onto the back of a John Deere Gator, and driven to the release site near Windigo, on the southwest end of the island. Less than an hour after her crate’s door was opened, she edged out and gave the project crew a beautiful last photo of her walking into the woods.

In her first days, she would have had food available as she settled into the island. Researchers had provided freshly-killed moose from the island’s over-abundant population, giving the new transplants a taste of the big prey the park service was hoping they’d become adept at killing themselves. A couple other translocated wolves had already been dropped off on the island, and its last native-born pair still roamed one side of Isle Royale.

INTERNATIONAL ADVENTURE

Her early movements “encompassed the entire island,” researchers said. Until Jan. 31, 2019. About that time, a dip in the Polar Vortex sent arctic air spilling down into the Great Lakes. Temperatures and wind chills plummeted. Enough of Lake Superior’s surface froze to create one of the infrequent ice bridges between Isle Royale and the mainland.

Isle Royale researchers said an ice bridge departure had been on their radar as a possibility, but it was still a disappointment to lose one of the project’s wolves that way.

“Ice bridges are always a possibility,” Orning said. “We really don’t know when they are going to form and when they’re not,” adding climate change has made them less predictable.

Researchers tracking the new wolves from afar via their GPS collars first noticed a discrepancy with all the new wolves’ tracking data during that Polar Vortex stretch. The NPS described it this way in a press release at the time:

“Mark Romanski, Isle Royale National Park’s Division Chief for Natural Resources and project lead for the wolf reintroduction efforts, had been monitoring GPS data from each of the translocated wolves ... . He noted the wolves had been moving about the southwestern end of the park. However, no locations were reported for nearly 5 days, between Jan 27th and Feb 2nd. This can happen when a wolf is hunkered down in dense forest cover and there is no clear view for the collar to transmit data up to the satellites. Blinded by the poor satellite transmissions, the park needed aerial observations to help locate the translocated wolves.”

On Feb. 2, 2019, Rolf Peterson and other researchers from Michigan Technological University – where the island’s wolf-moose study has been based for decades - arrived on Isle Royale. He quickly arranged to go up with a pilot so they could radio-track the new wolves from the air. They found signals from two of the three collared wolves that were supposed to be on the island at that time. As for W003F, Peterson caught a very static-filled signal radiating from off Isle Royale’s north shore toward Canada.

Wolf 003F left Isle Royale via an ice bridge across Lake Superior on Jan. 31, 2019. She crossed onto mainland Canada near the U.S. border with Minnesota.

“We followed the signal toward the north shore of the island and finally out over the open water of Lake Superior,” Peterson said at the time. “A lead a half mile wide had opened a few hours before, as the ice bridge was dislodged by a strong northeast wind. We flew out across the open lead and out over the ice pack then determined that the wolf’s signal was still to the north, straight to the mainland.”

Later that day, GPS data from the wolf’s collar came in, showing she’d headed north off the island, then cut a track west across the frozen lake, stepping into Canada near the Pigeon River and the U.S. border of northeastern Minnesota.

While researchers can’t get inside this wolf’s head and pinpoint exactly why she decided to risk leaving the island, they do know her GPS collar had showed decreased movement in the days before she left. That might show she was avoiding other wolves on the island.

“We posit food stress, social competition, and lack of breeding opportunity, or a combination of these and other factors may have facilitated the long-distance emigration of this wolf from Isle Royale.”

W003F's movements since she left Isle Royale in early 2019. She has traveled thousands of miles, crossing into the U.S. and then back to Canada.

In the months and years that followed, Orning said researchers kept an eye on the GPS data W003F’s collar kept sending back. Her far-flung movements implied she had not found a mate or integrated into a pack. Her preference seemed to be to stay on the move. Researchers saw that she traveled 1.5 times faster than other collared wolves on Isle Royale once she left.

Her recent locations have been around Atikokan, Ontario and the forests at the outskirts of Thunder Bay.

“She’s a Canadian now,” Orning said.

Even more than that, W003F has returned to the way she started – an untracked wolf. Her GPS collar failed at the end of December, Orning said. Where she goes next is up to her.

But The Weeknd was no savior on Sunday night.

All the projection screens, fireworks and light displays in the world (and there were A LOT) couldn’t save us from a so-so performance that underwhelmed. The Weeknd is an excellent performer and as much a visionary as any modern artist when it comes to showcasing pop music on a sound and visual scale.

But his art didn’t match the scale he was performing on Sunday. The sound (not his fault) was abysmal at best. The opening performance of “Starboy” set the stage for a wearying set. It didn’t help that The Weeknd carried the early parts of the performance on his shoulders alone, backed by projection screens, backing singers and musicians that faded into the background.

Things got better when he moved backstage and performed “Can’t Feel My Face” while mimicking the light and mirror effects of his recent videos. It’s where The Weeknd works best, at the center of chaos that captures your imagination.

The Weekend quickly returned to the stage where he held his own from a singing standpoint during a performance of “The Hills.” Still, it felt a bit sedated compared to recent Super Bowl performances from the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, or Lady Gaga. Dancing means a lot when it comes to a concert and that’s not The Weeknd’s trademark.

Still, he picked things up during the final portion, calling upon dozens of bandaged performers (that’s his latest gimmick after all) wearing (um) jockstraps on their faces (Note: They were actually bandages as part of The Weeknd’s “After Hours” gimmick but still...), to join him on the field during “Blinding Lights,” the song the NFL and CBS had embedded in our heads for months. Fireworks followed, but you were left still thinking about those jockstraps bandages (Because how could you not?).

Sadly, the Weeknd’s performance wasn’t as memorable as the pomp and circumstance might suggest. His resume looks the part of a star, but The Weeknd’s Super Bowl performance didn’t live up to the hype.","Fireworks, jockstraps can’t save The Weeknd’s Super Bowl halftime show"

['Kyle Austin'],https://www.mlive.com/spartans/2021/02/5-things-to-watch-center-questions-and-a-looming-rematch-for-michigan-state.html,[],,[''],en,2/5/2021 0:00,https://www.mlive.com,,set(),"Michigan State is coming off a bit of a backwards week.

The Spartans played well but lost at Iowa, as their best offensive performance of the Big Ten season wasn’t quite enough to earn a win.

Four days later, they played decidedly worse but still beat Nebraska to end a four-game losing streak – largely because they were at home against a team that was winless in conference play and coming off of a nearly month-long COVID-19 layoff.

So there were reasons to be happy and reasons not to be after each game. Now, the Spartans will hope for more of the former as they prepare to take on Penn State on Tuesday and Iowa on Saturday and continue to try to turn around their season after a 2-7 start to Big Ten play and make a long-shot bid for the NCAA Tournament.

Here are five things to watch:

Better Bingham?

Michigan State’s center job has been a jumbled mess all season, but heading into the final stretch of the season, there may at last be a frontrunner.

Marcus Bingham Jr. has started Michigan State’s last two games and shown some flashes of his potential. Against Nebraska, he had six points in 13 minutes, along with three steals, two blocks and an assist. He showed an increased aggressiveness to get to the rim and get fouled, and the baseline jumper he hit was an eye-opener.

For stretches like the first half on Saturday, when he recorded a steal and pushed ahead in the for an easy layup, he does things that no other Spartans big man can do.

Yet Bingham also got the quick pull early in the second half for a shot Izzo didn’t like. He may be playing better in spurts, but he’s not to the point yet where the coaching staff seems ready to increase his role significantly. Yet that could change if he keeps playing well.

Kithier available?

Speaking of the center position, the status of the player who started there until last week is up in the air.

Thomas Kithier left Saturday’s game with illness symptoms and was immediately isolated per COVID-19 protocols.

The Spartans were waiting on his test results immediately after the game. We’ll likely find out those results on Monday. If Kithier tested negative, he could return to practice on Sunday and not miss a game. But if he’s positive, he’d likely miss the Spartans’ next four games.

That possibility may not bother a lot of Michigan State fans, but rest assured not having him available would be a loss, and not one the Spartans need at this juncture of their season.

The schedule

Michigan State currently has Big Ten 17 games on its schedule, with three more needing to be rescheduled: Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.

The final week of the season was built to accommodate postponements, with six full days off. But unless it wants to squeeze three games into those six days, the Spartans will want to make another game up sometime in the next three weeks.

This week presents an opportunity: Illinois had its game at Michigan scheduled for Thursday canceled. The Spartans play on Tuesday and Saturday. The Illini could simply come to East Lansing instead of Ann Arbor on Thursday to make up the two teams’ canceled game from Saturday.

For Michigan State, playing three games in five days wouldn’t be ideal. But all three games would be at home, and it’s better than playing a back-to-back in the final week.

Even if that doesn’t happen, we could hear more this week about how the league plans to make up the Spartans’ three postponed games.

Penn State

Penn State is looking like a much tougher out than it was three weeks ago.

The Nittany Lions started 0-5 in Big Ten play, taking an expected step back after the departure of Lamar Stevens. Since then, though, they’re 4-2 with wins over Wisconsin and Rutgers.

They come to Michigan State on Tuesday fresh off of their best defensive performance of the season in a win over Maryland and having consistently performed well on the offensive glass.

It’s the type of game Michigan State has to win if it has any chance of going to the NCAA Tournament this year. And it looks like a tougher affair than it did a few weeks ago.

Iowa rematch

Stop me if you’ve heard this before, but after a strong start to the season Iowa is fading quickly in February.

It’s a phenomenon so familiar to Big Ten basketball fans that it now has its own term: “The Fran fade.” Since 2016, Fran McCaffery’s Iowa teams are 26-33 in February and March.

The trend is continuing this year. After a 12-2 start to the year that had the Hawkeyes in the top five of the rankings, Iowa is now 1-4 in its last five games following a Sunday loss at Indiana.

Michigan State is the only win in that stretch, and it was a close one at home. Now, the Spartans will try to be the next team to get its shot in on a reeling Hawkeyes team. Doing so will require defending the frontcourt better and now allowing the Hawkeyes to parade to the free-throw line again.",5 things to watch: Center questions and a looming rematch for Michigan State

Sometimes it’s just me counseling her. She often regales me about these wonderful times she has -- get-togethers with her other friends that I’m not invited to. She loves going into detail about how wonderful her excursions are, etc. I have always made excuses to myself about it -- I’m more boring and straight-laced than her other friends, not as rich, not as smart. (It’s true. I don’t party much. I’m a total lightweight.)

Also, I’m one of her only friends who hasn’t met her boyfriend of more than a year, and believe me, she has confided in me about their relationship the whole time. I have been concocting in my mind a way to address this with her without driving a wedge. (She can be very sensitive and defensive.) My boyfriend doesn’t like how she treats me, but she’s never been anything but kind and sweet with me, generally. She just doesn’t include me in her social circle. What is your take on this? -- STRANGE FRIENDSHIP IN CALIFORNIA

DEAR STRANGE FRIENDSHIP: My “take” is that over the last 20 years you have fulfilled one particular function in Gladys’ life, being her therapist and dog-walking chum. Period. Your boyfriend has a point. She appears to be centered on herself and insensitive about how her confidences have made you feel. In my opinion, what she has been doing isn’t kind and sweet; it is clueless. Ask Gladys (and her boyfriend) to go out for a social activity. It’s worth a try. If you really want to know why you have never been included in her social circle, I don’t think it would be rude to ask why -- IF you are prepared for the answer. It’s a fair question.

DEAR ABBY: My grandson-in-law seems to have no motivation to take advantage of his VA benefits after just having completed his military service and not having been trained to do anything in civilian life. He’s married and has a toddler. They have moved in with his parents, who babysit the child while his wife works. He wastes every day and doesn’t seem to want to find a job or get training (paid for by the VA).

My granddaughter is frustrated and at her wits’ end. We have offered suggestions and sent emails for virtual job fairs for veterans, but he doesn’t seem interested enough to apply for anything or follow up on the one or two interviews he has had. She has even filled out job applications for him. What can we do to encourage her or him? Frankly, I feel like she would be much better off leaving him. Any suggestions? -- GRANDDAD-IN-LAW IN FLORIDA

DEAR GRANDDAD: Your granddaughter’s husband appears to need more help than being steered toward job fairs. He may need to be medically and mentally evaluated. Could he suffer from PTSD, drug addiction or an undiagnosed mental illness? And what do his parents have to say about this? Once your granddaughter knows what she is dealing with, she will have a better idea of what to do about it. Right now the most helpful thing you could do is discuss with her what I have written and provide emotional support until she has some answers.

The second dose hit her harder. An emergency department physician for Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, Ford got the second shot after finishing a Friday work shift. She woke the next morning with “some teeth-chattering chills and muscle aches,” she said, and by afternoon, was so tired that she took a two-hour nap.

“I just had to take a couple doses of ibuprofen” to get through it, Ford said. “All told it, I was 100% within 36 hours.”

While it was inconvenient to spend part of her weekend feeling unwell, Ford said she was “happy” to experience the side effects.

“I knew it was just my body manufacturing those antibodies” against COVID-19, she said. “It was taking up some energy and causing a little immune response.”

Ford’s experience is fairly typical.

“As we’ve started our second-dose clinics, we’ve noticed an uptick in the recording of side effects,” said Dr. Christine Nefcy, chief medical officer for Munson Healthcare in Traverse City.

“Mostly, they are kind of what we expected -- generally not feeling very well for a day, swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, “she said. “Those are all signs of your immune system kind of kicking in and doing what it’s supposed to do.”

In that respect, the side effects are a positive sign, Nefcy said, which leads to a good news-bad news situation for senior citizens. “They tend not to have this robust immune response,” she said. That means fewer side effects with the vaccine, but also could mean fewer antibodies are being produced.

Todd Belding, pharmacy manager for Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, said he’s hearing the same things from his colleagues who have gotten their second dose of vaccine.

“We’re definitely hearing that people have more of a reaction after the second dose than the first dose,” he said. “I’m hearing people can feel fatigued from anywhere from one to three, four days afterwards, and maybe a sore arm for up to a week. But these are good things; it shows an immune response.”

He added that many people are trying to schedule their shots for when they are off the following day, but when that isn’t possible, “they find they can take some Motrin or Tylenol and work through” their shift.

The most commonly reported side effects from the Pfizer vaccine have been fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. Smaller numbers reported chills, joint pain or fever, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration briefing document.

The Moderna vaccine has similar side effects: Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and chills, according to the FDA briefing document. Swollen lymph nodes have also been reported.

Dr. Frank Rosenblat, an infectious disease specialist with McLaren Health in Pontiac, noted that not everybody experiences side effects.

“I didn’t have any side effects” with either dose, he said, and from his colleagues, “I’ve heard all kinds of stories about both vaccines. I’ve heard the second was terrible or the first was terrible or both were fine, and that’s with both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine. There’s really no rhyme or reason that I can pick out” in terms of how someone will react to the shots.

“But one has had what you would call a serious side effect,” he added. “You may lay in bed for a whole day, but nothing that’s life-threatening or what we would call a severe adverse drug reaction.”

And much better to experience mild side effects than to have coronavirus itself, Ford said.

“We know that COVID can be everything from asymptomatic to respiratory failure and death, she said. “What has concerned me are those long-term health issues -- those nonspecific, persistent issues of tachycardia, shortness of breath and things we don’t really understand. Nobody wants that.

“So I got the shots knowing there might be some symptoms but also knowing it would be protection for my myself and my community,” Ford said. “It’s just part of moving the pandemic response forward.”

Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits surrounded by Lake Superior’s frigid waters some 25 miles off the coast of the Upper Peninsula, which is how it came to be given the nickname “The Loneliest Place in the World.”

But this week, the lonesome lighthouse got to enjoy some visitors, when Stannard Rock became the subject of a U.S. Coast Guard mission to fix a window that had been blown in by a winter storm.

The last player from Michigan to win a Mega Millions or Powerball jackpot was Cristy Davis of Waterford who won $70 million playing Powerball in February. With her winnings, Davis said she planned to buy a new house and car.

And while she was a lucky winner, it’s smart for players to check their tickets immediately as a winner worth $1 million sold in Hartland in 2019 went unclaimed. The ticket was purchased at the Speedway in Hartland, but the winner never came forward to claim the prize. The money instead went to the state’s School Aid Fund.

It could be because many of us stayed home binge-watching shows and movies with a drink in hand to escape the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced us to stay home in the first place. While we might not know the exact reason so many drinks were downed, here’s what the latest data says about us.

The average Michigander consumed nearly 956 alcoholic drinks in 2020, a study by DrugAbuse.com revealed. That comes out to 18 drinks per week, which exceeds “heavy drinking” as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Last year, many of us tried to dull the stress and anxiety of isolation, and a host of other pandemic-related effects, with an overabundance of alcohol,” said DrugAbuse.com, a provider of substance abuse treatment resources.

Nearly 25% of Michiganders admitted to drinking more during pandemic stay-home orders and bar closures, according to DrugAbuse.com.

DrugAbuse.com surveyed 3,000 drinkers and found that the average Michigander’s consumption of 18 “standard size” alcoholic beverages per week last year was above the national average – 17 drinks per week.

Both figures exceed the CDC defined ‘heavy drinking’ amount of 14 drinks per week for men and seven per week for women. A standard drink is 12 ounces of beer (5% alcohol), 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol) or 1.5 ounces of liquor (40% alcohol).

Michiganders were the 10th heaviest drinkers across the country. Alaskans consumed the most alcohol with an average of 27 standard drinks per week – a total of 1,404 over the year on average. Comparatively, residents in Hawaii and New Hampshire drank the least with just 10 drinks per week.

Here are the 10 state’s that consumed the most alcohol per person in 2020:

Alaska: 1,404 Rhode Island: 1,261 New Jersey: 1,130 Oklahoma: 1,106 Arkansas: 1,076 Illinois: 1,050 Wisconsin: 1,025 Montana: 1,023 Vermont: 1,014 Michigan: 956

DrugAbuse.com estimates that the average American drinker spent 112 hours hungover during 2020.

A separate survey by American Addiction Centers found that 20% of people unemployed due to the pandemic turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism.

“Oh my goodness,” the Grand Rapids 28-year-old said upon being told about the gift from a local financial firm. “Thank you guys so much.”

After the charitable act of kindness this week, the single mother of five can stop worrying about her family potentially experiencing homelessness during the pandemic. Lopez, who was a receptionist at a salon, became unemployed shortly after the pandemic began.

“I have seen a lot of families that have become homeless and that was my fear,” Lopez said. “It’s actually happening – people are becoming homeless. I just didn’t want that for my family.”

In a surprise ceremony Wednesday, Feb. 3, Legacy Financial Network and Gradient Gives Back Foundation told Lopez they would pay for her mortgage through the end of the year.

Gradient originally started giving back like this in Minnesota. Michael Markey, Legacy Financial Network president, said he was inspired enough by Gradient’s efforts to bring it to the Grand Rapids area.

“I’m generally not an emotional person, and being able to do something that is going to make a huge impact on that person...,” Markey said. “I do believe in a ripple effect, and you help somebody and they’re going to help somebody.

“There are other organizations that do far more and other teams that wouldn’t be as excited, but a lot of our office people are here today because they wanted to be a part of that.”

['Ansar Khan'],https://www.mlive.com/redwings/2021/02/red-wings-givani-smith-shows-why-he-should-play-regularly.html,[],,[''],en,2021-02-08 11:01:00+00:00,https://www.mlive.com,,set(),"Givani Smith did not know what a Gordie Howe Hat Trick was until he recorded one on Sunday, in his 27th NHL game.

Smith scored a goal, registered an assist and picked up a fighting major, sparking the Detroit Red Wings to a 4-1 victory over Florida Panthers at BB&T Center, snapping their eight-game winless streak.

Smith has been shuffled from the taxi squad to the Grand Rapids Griffins and back to the Red Wings over the past few weeks as the NHL club juggled its lineup due to COVID issues, injuries and ineffectiveness.

He has appeared in only five of 13 games, but Smith is tied for sixth on the team with four points. He has earned a regular spot in the lineup, at least for an extended time.

“Tonight was a great example of what he brings to the team, what he’s been bringing every night he’s been in the lineup,” Robby Fabbri said. “He’s got a great mentality and mindset around the rink, coming in when he’s needed and doing his job. You saw tonight he did a little bit of everything – hits, a fight, a goal, and an assist. That’s what we need out of him every time he’s in the lineup.”

Smith brings several elements the Red Wings (3-8-2) need – size, toughness, strong forechecking and a net presence.

“He’s a big, big body and he’s got better skill than people might understand,” coach Jeff Blashill said. “He can make a play with the puck.

“He’s still got to get better on the wall breaking pucks out, but I think he’s done a good job of using his skill and getting to the net front and ultimately, he’s a big man around the net and he’s just hard to contain.”

Smith’s confidence is growing with each game.

“I had a long break to prepare, with COVID and everything, and I just wanted to be humanly ready, do everything I can to prepare myself for moments like these, where I got opportunities to play,” Smith said.

“Only thing I can really do is every time I’m in the lineup work my hardest and work my best and hopefully that can pay off in the long run.”

Greiss finally rewarded

After going winless in his first nine appearances as a Red Wing (0-7-2), Thomas Greiss made 36 saves to hand Florida its first regulation loss (6-1-2).

Greiss has played better than his statistics show (3.00 goals-against average, .903 save percentage). The team hadn’t supported him well offensively until Sunday and didn’t play well enough defensively at times.

“It got to a point where I felt bad it’s taken us this long to help him out and get one,” Fabbri said. “He’s been playing great all year. It’s nice we were able to pull one through for him.”

Greiss has started five consecutive games due to Jonathan Bernier’s upper-body injury. Bernier has resumed practicing and might return during this trip, which features another game in Florida Tuesday and two games in Nashville.

“(Greiss) certainly played good enough through large stretches of the year to have one and we didn’t give him enough offensive support,” Blashill said. “For him to finally get a ‘W,’ he certainly deserved it earlier in the year, so it was good for him to get it.”

Neutralized in neutral zone

After losing a pair of one-goal games to Florida the previous weekend, the Red Wings did a better job slowing down the Panthers in the neutral zone.

“This is a team that plays really fast, they get behind you, and I thought we did a way better job at clogging up the neutral zone,” Blashill said. “I would say both in our effort Friday (3-1 loss at Tampa Bay) and our effort today we were way better in the neutral zone creating turnovers and understanding how important that is. It’s something we’ve worked on the last couple practices and I think that’s been a big difference in our game.”

The Red Wings were averaging less than two goals per game, having scored as many as four goals only once. They applied more pressure on the Panthers, registering a season-high 39 shots on goal.

“We’ve been a pretty good O-zone team all year,” Blashill said. “We just got to make sure we clog up the neutral zone and we get through the neutral zone ourselves, get pucks in behind, make (defensemen) turn and create turnovers and play in the O-zone.”

But Mantha incurred a worse fate on Sunday, scratched from the lineup in a 4-1 victory over the Florida Panthers.

Coach Jeff Blashill confirmed after the game that Mantha was healthy and declined to say why one of the team’s top players was scratched.

“I just made a decision to go with the group I went with and any conversations I have with Anthony are private, between Anthony and I, and I’m not really going to comment further on it,” Blashill said.

The move was surprising because Mantha, after a slow start this season, had picked up his play of late, with three goals in the previous four games. He has four goals and seven assists in 12 games, but a team-worst minus-8 rating.

Blashill was asked about Mantha’s recent performance after practice Thursday in Tampa Bay, a day before the Red Wings’ 3-1 loss to the Lightning.

“I don’t think you can judge players just on offensive output,” Blashill said at the time. “I think there’s been moments in the games where he’s done what he needs to do to be successful and that’s skate. And there’s moments in the games where he hasn’t done enough of it and that’s something we’ll continue to work on.”

The Red Wings showed their faith in Mantha in the offseason by signing him to a four-year, $22.8 million extension.

Mantha, 26, earlier in his career drew Blashill’s wrath for his lapses in play, which stemmed from his tendency to occasionally float on the ice and not move his feet, particularly in the defensive zone.

Meanwhile, Blashill said Luke Glendening was feeling better after taking a shoulder check to the head from Radko Gudas in the first period. Glendening did not return to the game.

“I just talked to Luke; he seemed like he was in a good spot,” Blashill said. “We’ll see where he’s at for Tuesday’s game.”

The Red Wings and Panthers meet again at BB&T Center on Tuesday (7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit Plus).

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Lions initially asked the Los Angeles Rams for star defender Aaron Donald when discussing the trade for quarterback Matthew Stafford. Donald was named the league’s defensive player of the year over the weekend, the third time the defensive lineman has won the prestigious award.

“Rams told Lions, ‘that’s not happening,’ before the two sides later figured out the eventual compensation package,” Shefter said in a tweet.

Donald’s connection to the Lions persists after all these years in some capacity. Detroit famously passed on Donald in the 2014 draft despite needs on the defensive line, opting for tight end Eric Ebron instead. Donald is since a three-time defensive player of the year winner and one of the most feared names in recent memory, while Ebron is heading into his second season with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

For those in the dark, the Lions sent Stafford to Los Angeles for quarterback Jared Goff, a third-round pick in this year’s draft and two future first-rounders. The deal won’t be official until the league’s new year opens in mid-March, but Kelly Stafford posted a farewell letter to Detroit, not to mention an Instagram post while her husband, Matthew Stafford, took one last stroll through Ford Field.

This Donald news coming to light on Super Bowl Sunday wasn’t the only crumbling of information to slip through the cracks. ESPN also offered clarity on the offer the Lions declined for Stafford from the Panthers, saying Carolina offered Pick 8 in this year’s draft with quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and a fifth-rounder for the quarterback.

Holmes opted to take the offer with two Day 1 picks and a quarterback he’s familiar with in Goff instead. The move gives Detroit two first-round picks in each 2022 and 2023, which has to be music to the new GM’s ears after leading LA’s college scouting department for eight seasons.

Goff has $43 million in guarantees left on his deal and is under contract through 2024. There is no guaranteed money on the final two years of his recently-signed extension, though, meaning the Lions can get out of dodge after 2022 without eating a hefty tab. For those wondering, Bridgewater is under contract through 2022 with a base salary of $17 million in 2021 and $20 million in 2022 per Over the Cap.

Johnson joins former Michigan great Charles Woodson, quarterback Peyton Manning, receiver Drew Pearson, guard Alan Faneca, safety John Lynch, longtime Steelers scout Bill Nunn, and former Raiders and Seahawks coach Tom Flores in this year’s class.

The man known as “Megatron” played his entire nine-year career for the Lions, holding every significant receiving record the franchise has to offer. Johnson retired at age 30, finishing his career with 731 catches for 11,619 yards and 83 touchdowns. He’s a former six-time Pro Bowler, three-time All-Pro and member of the NFL’s All-Decade Team for the 2010s. Johnson was among four first-year finalists this year, joining Manning, Woodson and Jared Allen on the quest to go through this process only once.

Lions great Barry Sanders welcomed Johnson to the Hall of Fame in a video, which showcased David Baker surprising the receiver with word of his induction. Baker, the Hall’s president and CEO, is known for surprising each year’s inductees, not to mention his 6-foot-9 frame. Check out the video below:

While Johnson was playing, no other receiver caught more passes for more yards or averaged more yards per catch. He set the NFL’s single-season record for yards with 1,964 in 2012, turning in one of the most impressive three-year runs in league history at his position. While injuries helped budge him out of the game, Johnson still went out with 88 catches for 1,214 yards and nine touchdowns in his final season. That final campaign? Johnson had his knee drained each week just to stay on the field down the stretch in 2015, while also battling ankle issues.

He faced stiff competition at his position for this honor, going up against Torry Holt and Reggie Wayne to make it in 2021. Still, Johnson’s consistent dominance and NFL record-setting season gave him a boost despite his career going only nine seasons.

Johnson is now the 22nd former Lions player to make the Hall of Fame. Alex Karras was inducted in last year’s expanded 2020 class, which was part of the NFL’s centennial celebration. Before Karras, legendary coach and former Lions cornerback Dick LeBeau made it in 2010. Before that, it was tight end Charlie Sanders in 2007, not to mention fellow first-ballot inductee Barry Sanders in 2004.

The wide receiver has made headlines in recent weeks thanks to his HOF bid and rocky relationship with the Lions going under the microscope. After Johnson retired, the franchise came after some of his money, asking for half of his $3.2 million signing bonus to be returned. The Lions could have asked for the entire signing bonus back based on NFL rules, but the damage was already done in Johnson’s eyes. For what it’s worth, the Lions did the same to Sanders when the all-time great running back retired, asking him to return $5.5 million of his $11 million signing bonus. Sanders has been more involved with the franchise in recent years, serving as an advisor on the search for a new head coach and general manager.

“There hasn’t really been too much communication (with Detroit),” Johnson said on a recent appearance on the Huddle And Flow Podcast. “I mean, every time I go on any kind of anything public, you know, I get asked the question. And it’s simple. It’s like, yeah, it’s hard for me to do anything for anyone that takes anything from me, you know? I feel like after everything I did for the organization, (asking for money back) shouldn’t have even been a thought, honestly.”

The Detroit Free Press didn’t offer any details but recently said “there’s a chance” Johnson and the team start working on resolving their relationship in the coming months. Sheila Ford Hamp avoided the topic of Johnson’s money during a recent press conference, but the Lions owner flat-out said: “I hope we can repair things with Calvin Johnson.”

“We are 100% behind him for his Hall of Fame ballots and hope he gets it this time,” Ford Hamp said. “He was a great, great player and a terrific person, and we’d love to have him back with us and working with us and helping us with everything.”

This year’s class for the Pro Football Hall of Fame was elected through virtual meetings of the board of selectors. The class of 2021 will be introduced as part of a weekly celebration from Aug. 5-9 in Canton.

Yes, there’s another one at Michigan wearing the maize and blue. But sorry, the current sophomore isn’t related to the former Wolverines quarterback set to appear in his 10th career Super Bowl on Sunday.

RELATED: Ten Super Bowls later, a Michigan mentor still rubs off on Tom Brady

The college-aged Brady is a member of Michigan’s cross country and track and field teams, and is hoping to create his own legacy in Ann Arbor.

“Ever since I was little, it was always like whatever sport I was doing, it’s like ‘Wow, Tom Brady the quarterback is so great, you gotta be like him,” the Park Ridge, Illinois, native told MLive in a video interview. “So I just tried to work really hard and try to make a name for myself instead of just always having to be associated with his name. But I’m trying to be the best as I can, cuz there’s a lot to live up to with that name.”

Brady earned his first taste of success at the college level on Jan. 16 at the Simmons-Harvey Invitational, with a career-best time of 7 minutes, 58.06 seconds in the 3,000-meter run to break the meet and facility record. It was a breakthrough race for the 20-year-old, who battled injuries as a freshman before the COVID-19 pandemic cut the season short.

But when the pandemic came in early March, I just kind of decided to get to work and put in a lot of effort into the offseason to get better for the year. Going into the race, I was feeling pretty good about the shape I was in. I was trying to get into the right mental mindset of, ‘I can compete with these guys and I can’t be scared to try to win this race.’

“So when we got to one lap to go and I’m in the lead, I don’t know if I’ve ever wanted a race more in my life.”

During his college search, Brady, who was born the same year the quarterback made his NFL debut with the New England Patriots (2000), academics were his top priority. But when he also was offered the opportunity to run collegiately at Michigan, he jumped at it.

It didn’t take long for Brady to embrace the parallels to the six-time Super Bowl champion.

“That was a big topic of discussion on my official visit,” he said. “I think it was just the right move for me and I know I haven’t regretted it since. I’ve gone into classes, taking the bus, stuff like that -- I get something at least, if not every day, once every other day. When people see my name, they get pretty excited.

“I think they realize it’s not going to be the Buccaneers’ Tom Brady, but they still get excited that there’s a Tom Brady at Michigan. They sometimes think that I’m lying about my name or maybe that I changed my name on a Zoom call and are like, ‘Are you actually Tom Brady?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, I actually am Tom Brady.’”

Brady the runner wasn’t named after the quarterback. In fact, he is the fourth Tom Brady in his family (all with different middle names).

The younger Brady grew up a Chicago Bears fan, and the closest he has come to meeting the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns was watching the Patriots rout the Bears 36-7 from the stands in 2010.

“For some reason, there seems to be a lot of love lost between Bears fans and Tom Brady,” Brady said. “I don’t know what it is, but I was raised to root against him. The Patriots are like an evil empire to root against. As I watched more and more football, I was like. ‘Man, this guy always wins. It just gets annoying and I rooted against him. But I can really admire how successful he’s been and how hard he works.”

While 43-year-old quarterback Brady’s athletics career is likely nearing an end, runner Brady hopes his is just getting started.

“I know I’m never gonna be that Tom Brady from Michigan,” runner Brady said. “I think that’s safe to say, but it would be nice to be known at least in cross country and track as the Tom Brady from Michigan just to leave a leave a mark on the school, try to bring some hardware back for us in terms of us as a team winning Big Ten championships and doing well at nationals and just being remembered as another successful Tom Brady at the University of Michigan.”",There’s another Tom Brady at Michigan; this one’s on the run

But he’s not surprised.

Harden, an Ann Arbor native who retired from the University of Michigan last summer, has known the superstar quarterback since Brady’s sophomore year at Michigan.

It was 1997 when Harden, working as a counselor for the athletic department, found Brady on his appointment schedule. Harden had been attending Michigan football practices regularly at that time, and was often asked to give the team lectures of the ins and outs of life.

Nowadays, Harden is known for his inspirational messages and TED Talks that can be found on the Internet with a few clicks of a keyboard. In 2014, his work at Michigan was featured in a CBS “60 Minutes” segment.

But the day Brady arrived in his office, Harden realized that he was different.

Not athletically — that, he later told Brady, was not something he could help him with — but Brady came across as likable and willing to listen.

“The way he carried himself, the way he projected — he just seemed like he was more polished and more mature than the norm,” Harden said.

In fact, Harden could only compare his personal approach to that of Michigan wide receiver Desmond Howard, who had won the Hesiman Trophy as college football’s best player in 1991. Howard, too, met regularly with Harden during his time at Michigan.

“He was very curious,” Harden said of Brady in the late ’90s. “Of course, that was his opening gambit. But it was deeper than that. He just needed somebody to talk to.”

Truthfully, Brady was upset over his lack of playing time, he told SiriusXM Radio host Howard Stern in 2019.

Brady arrived at Michigan in 1996 to a packed (and talented) quarterback room, one that included two other future NFL players in Brian Griese and Scott Dreishbach. Dreishbach was the starter that year, while Griese won the job in 1997 en route to a 12-0 season that saw the Wolverines win the Big Ten Conference, their Rose Bowl game and lay claim to a share of the national championship.

For most of that time, Brady sat on the sidelines.

“I was looking up at all these guys on the depth chart who were ahead of me and I thought, ‘I’m never going to get a chance here,’” Brady told Stern. “So I remember talking to the people at Cal (University of California), because that was my second choice — to go to Berkeley. I was thinking maybe I should go there because I’d get more of an opportunity to play there.”

Brady said he told head coach Lloyd Carr how he was feeling, but he also told Harden. And while Harden admittedly couldn’t do much about helping him throw the football or read an opposing defense, he offered some personal advice that Brady later took to heart — and still credits Harden with today.

“You can worry about what everybody else is thinking or you can begin to control the controllables,” Harden said. “You can’t control what your coach thinks. All you can control is how you operate and how you see yourself, then everyone will see what you’re all about.

“Some folks, you have to ask them: ‘So, why don’t you leave?’”

Harden says the question often catches many off guard. But not Brady.

He was open and receptive to being told “you’re not good enough,” no matter how much it hurt to hear. A year later, Brady beat out highly-touted freshman Drew Henson for the starting job and went on to become a two-year starter, all-Big Ten honorable mention and captain in 1999.

And while his play in college was good, it was far from spectacular. Brady was drafted in the sixth round — “199th pick,” Harden points out — by the New England Patriots and thought of as a potential practice squad quarterback.

Did Harden predict Brady’s legendary NFL run as a 6-time Super Bowl MVP now considered one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play professional football?

“Hell no,” Harden says with a laugh. “I did not know. And anybody who said they knew is lying.”

On Monday, 43-year-old Brady addressed the media virtually as a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl LV (6:30 p.m., CBS), a game set to take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. He could not see the faces of reporters asking questions, only their voice echoing from a screen in front of him.

Brady was asked about a wide range of topics. Everything from his opponent this weekend, the Kansas City Chiefs, and their superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, to his decision to spend lavishly on watches for his offensive linemen. But a constant theme kept remerging in his answers. He credited those around him — his teammates, the Tampa Bay coaches, his family and support staff — for his success.

“I never would have thought, ‘Success is XX passing yards and touchdowns or Super Bowls,’” Brady said. “It was always about maximizing my potential and being the best that I could be. When I showed up as a freshman in high school and didn’t know how to put pads in my pants, I was just hoping to play high school football. Because I wanted to be like Joe Montana and Steve Young.

“When I got a chance in college, I just wanted to play at Michigan. Then when I got drafted to the Patriots, I just wanted to play; I just wanted to start. It’s been a series of steps like that, trying to be a little better every year, learn a little bit every year, try and grow and evolve in different areas.”

For Brady, that’s turned into a winning formula. And it all began with Harden, who Brady has called one of the most influential people in his life. The two still speak — and Harden serves as a life coach and consultant for other professional athletes and high-profile individuals. Yet Brady remains one of his best case studies. Because he sought the advice, listened and implemented what Harden told him.

“He’s the best in athletics because he’s more than an athlete,” Harden said. “He will never outrun you, (never) out-jump you — but he will kick your ass. He’s like Batman. Why do people love Batman? Because you will never be Superman and come from another planet.

“You’re not going to be bitten by a radioactive spider. But you have a chance to be the Batman. And that requires you to be mentally, physically and spiritually stronger than everybody else around you.”","Ten Super Bowls later, a Michigan mentor still rubs off on Tom Brady"

During our marriage our sex life was good (but infrequent).

Our kids are grown and moved out. My husband has heart issues and is on a lot of medication.

These meds make it impossible to have sex and he can’t take ED medications like Viagra, due to his heart issues.

These problems have made my husband very upset and he has stopped wanting sex all together. I’ve told him many times that I completely understand, and he is no less a man in my eyes.

But now there is nothing — no sex, no kissing. Nothing. He barely pays attention to me anymore. He escapes into the TV room when he’s home.

I feel very lonely and alone. I need advice on how to talk to him about this.

— Lost and Alone

Dear Lost: Sexual dysfunction and loss of libido is common in men who have had heart surgery or treatment for heart disease. (Your husband should see his doctor!)

My theory is that he proactively avoids affectionate physical contact because he associates this sort of contact with having sex. Because of his libido, impotence, and other medical problems, he is avoiding romantic contact because he can’t face the physical risk – and the fear and awkward conversations that force him to confront this extremely painful issue.

Over time, withdrawing from physical contact in order to avoid sex has led to him withdrawing in other ways.

You want to hug, hold hands, and kiss your husband. The way back in would be to make eye contact, tell him that you love him, and that you would like to hold hands with him and continue to walk through life together. Will he hold hands with you for five minutes? Set a timer.

Practice touching and demonstrating physical warmth and gauge his comfort.

Once he is confident that physical affection won’t lead to sex, pressure for sex, and all of the discomfort surrounding it, he should feel more comfortable being physically close with you. Physical closeness, warmth, and comfort will be good for your relationship – and also for his health.

Dear Amy: Over the past few years, my friend has become increasingly immersed in self-help empowerment through books, blogs, and podcasts.

It started after a breakup about five years ago, and she found strength, security, and solidarity in the gospel of self-affirmation and authentic living.

Now, every conversation is dominated by her rooting out “toxicity” in everyone else’s relationships and she is continually holding space for us “to live our truths” as she sees them.

She’s stopped dating, saying that every man she encounters suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (a disorder that she retroactively applied to the ex), and she discourages everyone in the group from dating because of this.

Pandemic isolation has only accelerated the issue, and we can no longer speak at all without her going on at length about what everyone else needs to do to achieve the equilibrium she feels.

Our friend group is very pro-therapy in general, but this friend says that whenever she’s tried therapy she’s ended up counseling the therapist more than the other way around. Now it’s affecting her professional life, as a colleague told her boss that she’s patronizing and a poor listener.

I miss my friend. How do you help someone who’s so convinced she’s helped herself?

— Self-Helpless

Dear Helpless: If your self-actualized and evangelizing friend feels so strongly about everyone around her “speaking their truth,” then this dictum applies to you, too.

I’m not saying this would be an easy conversation, but it is necessary for friends to tell one another the truth. This is both the burden and the joy of friendship.

Start your conversation with this phrase: “Can I offer you some feedback?”

Wait for her response.

Use “I statements”: “I feel like you’ve stopped listening to me because you are so focused on providing guidance. Right now — I need a friend, not a life coach.”

Dear Amy: “A Fan, Not an Alum in Chicago” wondered about wearing T-shirts from colleges they had not attended.

The late, great comedian Mitch Hedberg told a joke about doing college shows and always buying a T-shirt at the college bookstore: “While walking down the street one day someone shouted at me, ‘Hey, Wash U, did you go there?’ I shouted back ‘Yes, it was a Wednesday!’”

— Comedy Fan

Dear Fan: Another Hedberg gag: “I’m against picketing, but I don’t know how to show it.”

Alinosi Ice Cream and Candy has put, what it calls, its thriving business on the market, which includes its abandoned 1950s ice cream shop.

Alinosi is currently a two-person operation with the owner and a chocolatier, operating five days a week. The business makes ice cream and French-style chocolates which are distributed wholesale to various Metro Detroit grocery stores and restaurants.

The $595,000 price tag comes with the old soda fountain, abandoned in 1991, located at 12748 East McNichols Avenue in Detroit. Stepping inside looks like something you’d see on “Happy Days.”

“The manufacturing end of the business, the kitchen, is on the other side of the building,” Heather Dell of Good Company Realty told MLive. “The soda shop has just been dark since 1991. It’s almost like a museum.”

Dell says the business side of things is thriving, but the owner wants to retire. She says he would be happy to stay on for a short time and help show the new owner how to run the business.

“It’s truly a piece of Detroit that needs and wants to live on. The owners are just ready to retire and hoping to find somebody that wants to possibly reopen the soda shop, as well as continue manufacturing the ice cream, spumoni and chocolates. There’s even a refrigerator truck as part of the package.”

Dell says all the clients and connections are already in place for the next owner to essentially turn the key and get started.

“Alinosi has more demand than they even know what to do with. It’s a simple third generation family business and he’s just ready to retire. The amount of momentum that’s already there and all of the business connections should make the transition for the next owner pretty easy.”

Alinosi’s primary products are ice cream and spumoni, but they also make French-style chocolates. The master chocolatier is willing to stay on for the new owner.

“They make gorgeous French-style chocolates. They also make their own fillings, source their own nuts, have their own copper kettles and stone cooling slabs. It’s a really neat operation.”

The soda fountain has essentially been preserved. Dell says it looks and feels like 1950 in there and comes with just about everything the new owner would need to reopen it.

“The original neon sign which was on the outside of the building is still intact. The counters, the actual soda fountains, the coolers, the stools... everything is there. They’ve even got the giant molds ready to make those three-foot tall chocolate rabbits many Detroiters remember when they were kids.”

Alinosi has been around for 100 years. The family had numerous soda shops in the area. Along with numerous local grocery stores and restaurants, you can indulge in Alinosi ice cream and chocolates at the Alinosi Chocolate Bar Cafe in Grosse Pointe Woods. This business is not part of the sale as it is independently owned and operated.

Here is a link to the listing. You can contact Heather Dell from Good Company Realty at 248-464-1116 or via email.

Through the years, she did harmful things to me, which benefited her. Despite all that, I maintained a good relationship with her.

Bobbie befriended “Ted,” a divorced senior, and used him for many things – from driving her around, doing her yardwork, painting her house, and lending her a large sum of money to remodel her house.

She and Ted often went on short vacations together. After returning from one such trip, she went into a diatribe behind his back, trashed him and told me that she could not stand him. Yet she continued to go on trips with him.

After Bobbie had surgery, Ted came to her house daily to cook for her. I brought food for both of them, and learned later that she had eaten it all herself.

Bobbie passed away about a year ago and Ted took it very hard. He told me that Bobbie was a wonderful person who never said a bad word about anyone. I kept silent.

Many months have passed, and Ted is still grieving.

If Ted ever mentions again how wonderful Bobbie was, should I tactfully — without going into specifics — let him know that she was not the wonderful person he thought she was? Would telling the truth lessen his pain? Or would shattering his idealized image of her depress him even more?

— Undecided

Dear Undecided: Informing “Ted” that he is a lousy judge of character will not diminish his grief. Instead, this very nice man will move forward feeling bad about himself, “Bobbie,” and you.

What greater good does this serve?

You seem to have way too high a stake in your late-neighbor’s relationship with her friend. She’s gone now, and you are free to remember her in your own way, but you should not feel compelled to influence how others remember her.

Dear Amy: I need to know if I am overreacting or if my daughter is putting her life at risk.

I’m 68 years old and live in a “mother-in-law” studio on my daughter “Kathy’s” property.

I see her and my grandkids every day and I love it!

During this pandemic, the kids are schooling at home. My daughter has been looking for new hobbies to keep them busy and engaged.

I recently learned that Kathy and all four of my grandkids have been exchanging letters with people. This means that some random strangers have my grandkids’ names and our physical address!

I asked Kathy what the bloody Hell she was doing, and she said she communicated with these people prior to exchanging addresses and that she checked out and confirmed their identities. She knows them through Facebook (I don’t do anything online).

She says lots of people are doing this and that she and the kids have made some nice friends through this pen pal thing.

I am shocked that she would be so stupid! She has no idea who these people are!

They could show up at her house and kill her and kill or kidnap the kids!

My son-in-law is no help; he told me it’s a fun thing for them to do.

I am begging you to tell them to stop!

— Afraid Grandma

Dear Grandma: I agree with being cautious about beginning a correspondence with a pen pal, certainly when there are children involved.

Your daughter has been cautious, doing her best to confirm the identities of the people her children are corresponding with. Both parents are involved and engaged.

I do NOT share your hysteria about this. Pen pals have existed for as long as people have been able to send and receive letters. Many wonderful lifelong friendships have started with pen pal correspondences between strangers.

Yes, there is always a risk of revealing your identity and address to strangers, but individuals manage this risk every single day in their online worlds.

You would be wise to develop a friendly and nonjudgmental interest in this. That way, the children would be inspired to share their correspondence with you, enabling you to make sure it is not placing them at risk.

Dear Amy: I get frustrated sometimes when you refer to things in your column that I’ve never heard of. Not everyone is as familiar as you are with popular TV shows, movies, or books.

Please make your answers accessible for everyone.

Now, the Stafford’s ritzy mansion is back on the market, listed for $6.5 million.

The 12,000-square-foot estate is located at 1867 Long Pointe Drive in Bloomfield Hills with more than 400 feet of frontage along Upper Long Lake. The Staffords, who have four young kids, originally listed the home for the same price last summer because they wanted to find a place with less water. Here’s what Kelly said at that time.

“We’re about to have our fourth child and I personally do not want to live on a lake or have a pool with four children under the age of a little over 3. That house has been incredible. We’ll never have a house like it. So it is a super sad thing, but it just makes us feel better knowing that there’s no real dangers of having tiny ones running around all the bodies of water.”

The Stafford’s realtor tells MLive they took the home off the market because did not want to move during the football season.

“We had been looking for homes in the area, but now obviously circumstances have changed so we relisted the home,” Jeff Barker, associate broker at Max Broock Realtors told us. “I’ve been their realtor and friend for 11 years and am sad to see them leave.”

The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home has a larger infinity pool than any other home in all of Michigan, according to the manufacturer. It comes complete with a cascading waterfall over the side.

Another feature you won’t find anywhere else than this house, which was built in 1980, is the indoor half basketball court. But it’s not just any court. The floor is the original court the Detroit Pistons played on when they were at the Pontiac Silverdome. This court was already inside the home when the Staffords purchased it.

The kitchen has two islands with counter-top seating. Then, there’s the dining room with a glass floor in the which looks into the more than 600-bottle, temperature-controlled wine cellar below. And when you’re in the wine cellar, you can see above into the dining area.

“This home is in pristine condition. It’s an entertainer’s dream. It has anything anyone could possibly want in today’s world. It’s probably one of the nicest homes in the country, not just in Michigan. It’s really a spectacular residence,” added Baker.

The Staffords remodeled the home in 2016 and added more than 2,000 square feet to it. The interior now features polished granite floors throughout, along with new cabinetry. There are five fireplaces, a glass elevator which services all three floors and a giant man cave, which you can see in the photo gallery above with the pool table.

The first-floor master suite now features a marble bathroom. There’s also an entertainment area in the bedroom with a TV on the wall and a coffee bar. Two of the other four bedrooms have balconies the Staffords added in the remodel.

Down in the walkout lower level there’s a sauna and steam room along with a room with two side-by-side tubs. To get to the home you must drive through an iron gate. There’s a three-car garage with mirrored doors to reflect the scenery. There’s a brick paver driveway, limestone exterior, granite front porch and a two-story foyer.

Here is the listing to the home from Max Broock Realtors of Birmingham. You can contact the realtor if you are an interested buyer.

After the election in November, this neighbor moved out of his house and back in with his mother, and got involved in all the “stop the steal” efforts that culminated in him traveling to Washington, D.C., and storming the Capitol.

After I showed the footage of him to his (Biden-voting) wife, she told me she’d been texting with him during the day, telling him to stay away, and telling him that it was a federal crime to go inside, etc., but that he’d gone inside, anyway.

Later I heard that he was so excited about seeing himself on this video footage that he’s planning to get it made into a photo and have it framed.

He’s been my next-door neighbor for nine years. When his tree blew down, I grabbed my chainsaw and helped cut it up. When my fence blew down, he came over and helped. He’s jumped my car battery. I’ve cut his grass when they’re out of town. Next-door neighbor stuff.

I don’t know if I should report him or not. On the one hand, if those people aren’t punished, they might be emboldened to do something else. I also don’t believe the penalty (if any) will be significant.

— Concerned in the South

Dear Concerned: As of this writing, over 200 people have been arrested for participating in what Republican (former) Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called “an armed and failed insurrection attempt” in the U.S. Capitol building by a “mob… which was fed lies, provoked by the president [Donald Trump] and other powerful people.”

The FBI has explicitly asked for the public’s help in identifying participants (send online tips to tips.fbi.gov) or call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).

USA Today is publishing an updated list of those arrested, including details of their alleged crimes and how they were caught. Some have turned themselves in, but the Bureau has also reportedly received over 140,000 tips leading to arrests – the majority coming from family members, friends, neighbors, and people who went to high school with the rioters and recognize them from footage taken inside the Capitol.

So yes, report your neighbor, unless you have reason to believe that doing so would place you in danger.

If your neighbor is so proud of his crime and behaving so boldly now, there is a likelihood that someone else has also reported him (his wife or his mother, for instance).

Being a helpful neighbor to you does not preclude this person from also being a danger to the public – and the Republic.

Dear Amy: I feel like I have an unhealthy fear of death. I think about it at least once a day, and always worry about my husband and baby dying, too.

How do I stop this? I am really tired of thinking this way, but don’t know how to stop.

Do you have any advice?

— Deathly Afraid

Dear Afraid: We are in the midst of a global pandemic. Over 400,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Many of us are unable to have many of the quotidian daily experiences that serve as important distractions from this simple fact: Every living thing dies.

This fear actually connects you with others. Anyone who isn’t ruminating at least a little bit about death these days isn’t paying attention.

Having a husband and a new baby has upped the ante for you. Your protective instincts have kicked in. Loving other living things reminds you of how precarious life is.

Address your thoughts directly. Make “friends” with your fear. Name it “Stan.”

When thoughts arise, say to yourself, “Not today, Stan. I’ve got things to do.”

Immediately and deliberately distract yourself. I suggest smelling the top of your baby’s head. This scent is a tonic, guaranteed to chase away all bad things.

Dear Amy: “Dog Worshipper” wanted your help in talking his parents into getting a dog.

I am a volunteer with Above and Beyond English Setter Rescue. After I read your answer to this boy (which was very good), I thought about suggesting that they sign up to foster.

Local shelters and mixed/all-breed rescues are always in need of foster homes. The rescue/shelter pays for vetting fees such as spay/neuter, heartworm treatment, and vaccines.

Fostering can be hard, but it can also be very rewarding, and it makes room for another dog at a shelter or to be helped by a rescue.

— Pat Nichols

Dear Pat: Fostering is a fantastic suggestion. Thank you!

We haven’t seen these bugs with the big red eyes since 2004.

From North Carolina to Connecticut and all the way into Michigan, humans will be outnumbered by the insects by about 600 to 1. Essentially, they will be all over the place, but won’t make it everywhere in Michigan.

“They’ll be only in the extreme lower southeast peninsula. Ann Arbor is about as far north as they come,” said Howard Russell, an insect/arthropod diagnostician at Michigan State University. “Nearby, they occur pretty much throughout Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. They’re in Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and quite a few other states. This is the most widespread brood.”

These are some of the world’s longest-living insects and while they stay underground, the bugs aren’t actually asleep. They go through different growth stages before coming to the surface to mate.

“They basically decide this is the 17th year of our development and it’s time to leave the tree root they’ve been feeding on the last 17 years,” said Russell. “The adults have wings, fly off and harden for up to a week after they emerge. They crawl up into the trees, mate and the females lay eggs. Then, generally in 6 weeks, they’re all done and we don’t see them for another 17 years.”

When we start to see them depends on the ground temperature. They emerge when the ground soil is 64 degrees. That means we should start seeing the big swarms in southeast Michigan in May and June. Adults live several weeks - the ones which aren’t eaten, of course.

“Birds, animals, pets and even mice probably feed on them,” said Russell. “They’re mostly a nuisance. They make a lot of noise and fly all over and even fly on you. If you’re in an area where there’s a high concentration of them, they can be pretty intimidating, but they’re not going to hurt us.”

While we do see annual cicadas every year, the Brood X, which is one inch in size, is the one we see every 17 years. They swarm in much larger numbers than the annual ones.

“There’s another species commonly referred to as the Dog-day cicada,” added Russell. “It has a three to four year life-cycle, rather than a 17-year life cycle. The emergence of the Dog-day cicada is not synchronous like it is with the periodical cicadas. So Dog-day cicadas occur each year. They’re different. They’re a little bigger, greenish and don’t have the bright red eyes.”

This is expected to be one of the larger emergences of cicadas we’ve seen of these periodical cicadas. Some experts believe there are 30 billion of them lurking underground, while others think there could be as many as a trillion which will emerge.

If the cicadas are in your area and you don’t see them, you’ll definitely hear them. They make a loud noise which is essentially the bugs singing for sex. In 2004, Gene Kritsky, an entomologist at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, measured cicadas at 94 decibels, saying it was so loud “you don’t hear planes flying overhead.”

So, why every 17 years? Some scientists believe they emerge in this odd cycle to avoid predators. There’s simply too many for birds and other animals to eat them all when they are in such large numbers. Other theories say the unusual cycles ensure that different broods don’t compete with each other.

“These guys have evolved several mathematically clever tricks,” said University of Maryland entomologist Mike Raupp. “These guys are geniuses with little tiny brains.”

You can now indulge in these treats ahead of Fat Tuesday, according to the Associated Press via the Free Press.

Polish Village Cafe is located at 2990 Yemans St. in Hamtramck, where people have been enjoying the traditional Polish dinners for years, as well as its authentic paczki, those famous jelly donuts many people wait in long lines to enjoy every February.

To try something different this Paczki Day, which is on Tuesday, Feb. 16, Wietrcykowski says she wanted to create something new, so she combined pierogis and paczki and says the combination actually works.

“I was just thinking about all the different things that are happening and that I did want this Paczki Day to have something new so that it was exciting, because we wouldn’t be able to provide the same thing we did in years past,” Wiertrcykowski told the Free Press. “I was like what two better words are there: pierogi and paczki. I was like we got to figure out how to do this so that that was basically it.”

Polish Village Cafe already makes various perogis, including potato and cheese, cheeseburger, pepperoni pizza and chicken pot pie. Pierogi-paczki are available for three for $6. You can call 313-874-5726 or order online.

Other places in the area where you can get your paczki for Fat Tuesday are: New Palace Bakery in Hamtramck, New Martha Washington Bakery in Hamtramck and Paris Bakery in Livonia.

Pricing for Apple’s AirPods is constantly in flux and none more so than on Amazon, which has introduced two discounts on the wireless ear buds in the past week alone. This time round, the wired charging versions are down to $110, another $10 off from the previous deal and a $50 saving on the original retail price.

By now, you’re probably familiar with the world’s most popular wireless headphones. As a reminder, Apple refreshed its buds in 2019 with the addition of a new H1 chipset that makes syncing to your iPhone that slight bit quicker. The same goes for wirelessly connecting to your MacBook or iPad, making them the go-to for Apple fans.

Charging is wired for the models on sale, but that also means they’ll charge quicker. While the battery life should last around five hours (with four to five extra charges through the case). Though we’ve seen the classic AirPods drop as low as $100 in the past, the $110 price tag is still solid if you missed the holiday sales or if you’re looking for a Valentine’s Day gift.

If you’ve got a bit extra to spend, it’s worth noting that Amazon also has the AirPods Pro on sale for $190. The high-end version boasts a customizable fit and active noise cancellation that translates to better sound quality.",Apple's AirPods drop back down to $110 on Amazon

It flashed on the screen for just five seconds, showing Reddit’s famous orange-and-white logo, along with a message. “If you're reading this, it means our bets paid off. One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything when we come together around a common area.”

That’s in reference to how the WallStreetBets subreddit thwarted Wall Street short sellers by buying up GameStop stocks. That led to huge hedge fund losses on the short positions, while Redditors who got in (and out) early made huge gains. The extra infamy also brought a huge traffic gain to Reddit, which saw a tenfold increase in new users over the period of January 24th to 30th.

“Who knows, maybe you'll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on ‘tendies,’” the ad read. “Powerful things happen when people rally around something they really care about. And there's a place for that. It's called Reddit.”

GameStop’s rise was curtailed by broker Robinhood, which stopped and then slowed trades on the stock. Robinhood ran its own 30-second Super Bowl spot celebrating ordinary investors.

Reddit said it spent its “entire marketing budget on five seconds of airtime,” which could be upwards of $1 million considering that a 30-second spot reportedly costs $5.5 million this year (Reddit is valued at nearly $3 billion, according to TechCrunch). “I am really proud of what we were able to achieve with just five seconds and think it beautifully captures the heart of Reddit in our unique and brilliantly absurd tone,” Reddit’s chief marketing officer Roxy Young told CNN.",Reddit celebrated WallStreetBets success with a five-second Super Bowl ad

However, the potential deal went from “close” to “paused” pretty quickly, and now the automakers say they’re no longer in talks with Apple, according to Bloomberg.

Hyundai would have provided the electric vehicle platform built in North America for Project Titan, while Apple would have developed the vehicle’s hardware and software. Hyundai confirmed that conversations did take place, though it hedged it a bit by saying that “we understand that Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motors.”

Production was supposedly going to start by 2024, according to one report from Korea IT News, so the latest development is quite a letdown from that. Apple’s famous privacy is a breeding ground for rumors, though, especially over a product as potentially consequential as an autonomous EV.

It’s possible that the companies have decided to keep talks on the down-low, and they could still restart. Apple has reportedly also spoken with six Japanese automakers, according to a recent Nikkei report. However, analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who has a good record on Apple rumors, recently told Apple Insider that Apple still plans to use Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for its first EV, with Kia manufacturing the vehicle in the US no sooner than 2025.",Hyundai and Kia say they're not talking to Apple about an autonomous EV

PC World and Tom’s Hardware report that Intel has shared a legion of benchmarks claiming to show that 11th-generation Core i7 laptop processors are faster than the M1. They do suggest there are areas where Intel can claim victory, although there are also questions about Intel’s methods.

The results have Intel pulling ahead of Apple in a Chrome browsing test, Office 365 tasks, Adobe creative apps and AI. While gaming was something of a wash, Intel pointed out that certain games simply aren’t available on Macs. The chip giant also argued that Apple’s battery life claims were just fluff — they weren’t any better than a Core i7 in practice, Intel said.

Intel was also keen to point out the better support for external monitors and a greater variety of hardware in its camp, such as touchscreen laptops.

However, there are concerns about the methodology. For one, Intel switched hardware between tests, both for its own CPUs and Apple’s. It used a MacBook Air for the battery life test rather than the longer-lasting Pro, for example. Intel also chose some tests that favored its components particularly well, such as a Topaz Labs AI test — one of the few to make use of Intel’s hardware acceleration. It’s safe to say these figures don’t entirely line up with some reviews, including ours.

Companies routinely cherry-pick benchmarks that put their products in the best light, of course, and it’s true that compatibility and variety skew in Intel’s favor. However, the very fact that Intel is offering these benchmarks speaks volumes. Intel sees Apple’s chips as enough of a threat that it feels compelled to launch a media offensive, and it’s unlikely to go soft on its new rival in the future.",Intel tries to take down Apple's M1 chip with a flurry of benchmarks

YouTuber Dave2D has obtained images of what looks to be a OnePlus 9 Pro with conspicuous Hasselblad branding on its rear four-camera array. If accurate, OnePlus clearly wants buyers to take its camera technology seriously.

It’s not certain just what the camera array could do, although it’s safe to presume you won’t find a Hasselblad medium format sensor inside. The images show two large sensors (standard and ultra-wide?) along with two much smaller cameras that could include a macro cam There’s also what appears to be laser autofocus above the flash.

The array is superficially similar to purported leaks for the base OnePlus 9, although that rumored phone is missing the extra camera and laser as well as the Hasselblad branding. It might get an “Ultrashot” label instead.

The Dave2D leak also seems to corroborate claims about the front, including its curved, 1440p 120Hz display. This unit comes with 11GB of RAM (more likely 12GB in shipping units) and 256GB of storage.

Whether or not a Hasselblad partnership would help isn’t certain. Motorola’s Hasselblad-branded phone mod offered a meaningful improvement to still shots, but you weren’t about to mistake it for a studio-quality camera.

We’ve seen numerous Mac mini sales before, but they’ve almost always been limited to the entry-level version.

This could be a great deal if you’re looking for a compact desktop that still packs a reasonable punch. As we’ve discovered in our reviews of the latest MacBooks, the M1 is a transformative chip — it sometimes delivers performance you’d expect from higher-end desktop CPUs, let alone chips in its class. You can also expect a very quiet computer, even under some heavy workloads. The 512GB of storage is highly recommended if you intend to keep local media or run larger apps.

There are limitations. This model still has 8GB of RAM — it’s more efficient than you’d expect, but this isn’t the computer for you if memory is all-important. There are also just two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports that could limit your expansion, and it can’t handle more than two displays at once. That’s not including any hiccups from certain apps that haven’t been optimized for the M1 yet, such as some development tools. If you’re simply looking for a speedy machine for everyday use, though, you might have everything you need.

TechCrunch has learned that Minneapolis police used a search warrant to obtain geofenced location info in hopes of identifying at least one person who set fire to an AutoZone store during May 27th, 2020 protests over the death of George Floyd. Officers wanted “anonymized” account info for any device close to the store during a 20-minute span.

The police department has declined to answer questions, citing an active investigation. However, they believe a key suspect, nicknamed “Umbrella Man” for the object he used to break windows at AutoZone, sparked broader violence at protests that were otherwise peaceful. This man was linked to a white supremacist group.

As with other geofenced data requests, though, the demand was broad and appears to have swept up people who were likely innocent. One of the people Google warned about a request, Said Abdullahi, said he was just a bystander recording video of the protests near AutoZone when the destruction started. Critics have maintained that these requests are attempts to dodge constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and have a history of implicating innocent people.

There are efforts to limit these location requests. New York state has floated a bill that would ban geofence warrants precisely to prevent attempts to stifle protests. For now, though, these sweeping data requests are ongoing and could have a chilling effect on activists worried they might be targeted merely for showing up at a protest.",Minneapolis police used Google location data to find George Floyd protesters

Throw in recent additions like spatial audio and the AirPods Pro can be compelling, whether you’re using them for video calls or movie marathons on the couch.

The caveats haven’t changed, either. You might find better sound quality from offerings like Sony’s WF-1000XM3. The on-bud controls are fiddly, and you’ll have to dive deeper into iOS to change settings. There’s also the not-so-small matter of platform support.

MIT researchers have developed an “origami-inspired,” biodegradable medical patch that can be folded around a robot’s minimally invasive surgical tools to seal internal damage.

While bioadhesive patches are already in use for this kind of surgery, they can create flawed seals and even do their own damage, like inflammation and scar tissue. MIT’s design solves these issues through a three-layer patch with a hydrogel-based adhesive, a silicone oil-coated material to prevent unintended sticking and an elastomer outer layer whose zwitterionic nature (that is, a molecular chain with positive and negative ions) protects the patch against bacteria.

The result is a tape that easily wraps around robotic tools while adhering strongly to tissue, even after it has been immersed in fluid for long periods. A test patch avoided contamination even after a month, too. A robot might only need to apply light pressure or inflate a balloon to apply a patch.

Any practical application might take a long while. However, the scientists envision companies selling prefolded patches that would slip on to existing tools. They’re hoping to collaborate with robotic surgery platform developers. If that happens, you could see greater use of robots and bioadhesives in the medical world — not to mention gentler recoveries from some procedures.",Origami-like patch could help robot surgeons repair internal injuries

The probe should enter Mars orbit on February 10th, with its rover touching down at the Utopia impact basin in May.

The country tried sending a mission to Mars in 2011 with Russian help, but that failed at launch. Not that trips to the Red Planet have been easy for anyone. The ESA, Russia, the US and other countries and organizations have routinely struggled to make the journey.

As the New York Times explained, the White House has launched a “weekly conversation” series that embraces the more informal style of podcasts. The first episode, a chat with a worker laid off during the pandemic, is available on YouTube (below) and social media platforms, but probably won’t reach your local radio station.

The aim is to use the formats and platforms “where [people] are,” White House digital strategy director Rob Flaherty told the Times.

This isn’t an in-depth, heavy-hitting discussion like with some podcasts. Like classic weekly radio addresses, this is about amplifying the President’s message. You’re theoretically more likely to support Biden’s agenda as he discusses it each week, especially if it’s presented in the same way as a podcast or YouTube show.

It’s far from certain that this approach will work. Past presidents have had varying degrees of success with weekly addresses, ranging from Reagan’s triumphs to Carter’s failures. There are many political shows online, and many of those will ask questions that won’t come up in an official presentation.

Reuters reports that China is launching a data platform on March 1st that will let the public and officials study real-time and recorded emissions levels to determine if factories and institutions are violating pollution regulations. You could theoretically catch a manufacturer in the act and pressure them into complying.

Chinese companies are required to get permits to spew pollutants into the atmosphere, but officials previously had trouble gathering the necessary info and frequently dealt with firms either falsifying data or stalling on information requests. Lawbreakers face daily fines, and those intentionally dodging supervision face arrest.

Under the new system, companies will have to install monitoring equipment and maintain at least five years of data. Companies that don’t comply will have to pay fines of 200,000 yuan (about $31,000), while pollution offenders risk fines up to 1 million yuan (roughly $154,600).

It’s a dramatic move that might not fly elsewhere, particularly in countries where publicly sharing factory data might be treated as a competitive disadvantage. A sudden surge in pollution could reflect an increase in customers, for instance. Still, it might help China get a better hold on rogue polluters and reduce its contributions to smog and climate change.",China is launching a public data platform to name and shame polluters

While it’s still from Constantin Film, the German production company behind Paul W. S. Anderson’s adaptations, it’s not going to follow Milla Jovovich’s Alice anymore. The upcoming film is expected to follow the games closely and will serve as a reboot of the franchise’s movie series. Constantin first revealed its plans to make an origin movie based on the games late last year, with writer/director Johannes Roberts at the helm.

At the time, Roberts said he wanted to “go back to the original first two games and recreate the terrifying visceral experience [he] had when [he] first played them” while also “telling a grounded human story about a small dying American town that feels both relatable and relevant to today’s audiences.” Unfortunately, Deadline didn’t say how the movie will be released. More and more film outfits are choosing to make their movies available for streaming at the same time or shortly after theatrical release due to the pandemic’s effect on the industry.

Since the reboot will be under Sony in the US, though, there’s a chance that it will go through a traditional theatrical release first. The company is sticking to a traditional theatrical distribution strategy, and Sony Pictures CEO Tony Vinciquerra previously told CNBC that it’s been working in the entertainment giant’s favor. “...the real benefit has been the number of incoming calls from talent, creators, actors, and directors to us saying, ‘We want to be doing business with you because we know you're a theatrical distributor and producer.’ That has worked very well for us,” he said.

The upcoming film will be set in 1998 and, according to franchise producer Robert Kulzer, will “explore the secrets hidden in the walls of the Spencer Mansion and Raccoon City.” It truly does sound like it will be (a hopefully somewhat fateful) adaptation of the first two games. Kaya Scodelario, probably best known for playing Teresa in Maze Runner, will star as Claire Redfield, while The Flash’s Robbie Amell will play as her missing brother Chris.

According to BBC News, NetBlocks has discovered that Myanmar instituted a “near-total internet shutdown” in the country a of the morning of February 6th. Connectivity was just 16 percent of normal levels, NetBlocks said. Residents had been using VPNs to get around earlier content bans, but the blackout rules them out for most people.

The shutdown followed mere hours after Myanmar blocked Instagram and Twitter, widening a ban that previously targeted Facebook. The Ministry of Information claimed on February 2nd that users had been using social networks to “incite rowdiness.”

It’s not certain if or when the military regime will lift restrictions. That’s unlikely in the near future, though, as large-scale protests are continuing despite the new measures.

Unfortunately, Myanmar is using a familiar strategy.

The post-CES time can be slow for tech reviews, but this week we were able to check out upgraded devices from ASUS and Nikon. ASUS recently debuted the second version of the ZenBook Duo, which has a redesigned dual screen and software that takes advantage of its unique design. We also spent time with Nikon’s Z7 II, which is the successor to the Z7. This newer shooter has improved upon some core features like battery life and autofocus, and it has 4K 60p video and 5-axis stabilization.

The new ASUS ZenBook Duo is an improved dual-screen notebook

Devindra Hardawar/Engadget

Devindra Hardawar was pleased to see the upgrades that ASUS made to the second iteration of its ZenBook Duo laptop. The 2021 model has gotten a power boost, a rising, angled second screen and a software overhaul that takes better advantage of both displays. The new notebook has both a 14-inch, 1920 x 1080 resolution main screen and it also boasts a 12.6-inch ScreenPad Plus which sits just above the keyboard. The ScreenPad Plus lifts up slightly as the laptop is opened and Devindra found it most useful for running apps like YouTube or Spotify in the background while he worked on the primary screen.

However, there’s a tradeoff with this feature -- the cramped keyboard and trackpad. While Devindra thought the keys had a decent amount of travel and feedback, the keyboard felt uncomfortable to use without a wrist rest and the trackpad felt shoved to the right with little room for multitouch gestures. But with an 11th-gen Intel Tiger Lake processor, more powerful integrated graphics, up to 32GB of RAM, a better selection of ports, and a lower $999 starting price, the notebook still snagged a Best of CES award from us.

Nikon Z7 II is a solid upgrade, but leaves a bit to be desired

Steve Dent/Engadget

Similarly, Steve Dent found worthwhile improvements in Nikon’s Z7 II. The successor to the Z7, this camera has better autofocus, 4K 60p video, 5-axis stabilization, a longer battery life and good image quality. Steve also liked the rugged build, saying the Z7 II is “a tank” and that he felt comfortable toting it around wherever he went. At $3,000, it’s also on the lower end of the price scale for a high-res, full-frame, mirrorless camera.

However, the upgraded Z7 II is lacking in a few areas when compared to its rivals. It doesn’t support internal 10-bit video recording, it has low-res EVF, middling shooting speeds and a display that only tilts. Steve felt it couldn’t compete with the Sony A7R IV on resolution, image quality or shooting speeds, nor could it keep up with the Canon EOS R5 in terms of autofocus and video capabilities. But the Z7 II has affordability going for it -- it’s significantly cheaper than both of those other models, and it still produced sharp images, pleasing colors and worked well in a variety of photography situations.",ICYMI: Check out ASUS’ new dual-screen laptop in action

However, NVIDIA is trying to minimize that chaos — a spokesperson told The Verge the company now requires laptop makers to be transparent on RTX 30 specs.

PC builders now have to disclose the clock speeds, power demands and Max-Q features in their product pages to convey the “expected GPU performance” for a given laptop, NVIDIA said. You should get a better sense of which laptops have the most powerful real-world performance.

It may take some time for that requirement to manifest in the real world. ASUS is divulging more detailed specs, but that isn’t yet true for everyone.

Digital inequality describes the uneven distribution of connectivity and access to digital infrastructures. Often these inequalities are assumed to be a natural problem of rural areas, one that broadening the agent network or switching to smartphones will remedy. The way these networks themselves produce and amplify inequalities is less rarely considered. Maintaining a phone over time, replacing and fixing it, purchasing airtime, and paying for money transfer (including cash-in/cash-out fees) displace significant costs onto the users, with the result that inequalities based on social class, gender, and disability affect the ability to securely access mobile technology. Users in Western Kenya frequently access the phones of others or keep a SIM card that they insert into a borrowed handset. Accessing phones or handsets through social relationships may be more likely among women and can create social dilemmas and risks ranging from compromising one’s PIN number to jeopardizing one’s physical safety. Literacy and numeracy are also barriers: at least one billion people cannot read digital displays of money amounts accurately; yet people in Myanmar, Ethiopia, and Tanzania are quite competent in using colors and symbols on cash money to denominate, earmark, and plan money use. Accessing services often requires local knowledge—for example, which hill is the one to climb to find mobile network service? People who are more than a short walk from a mobile money agent may see no reason to keep e-money on a mobile wallet when they will need cash for their daily use, which they can keep at home. Most rural areas—including rural Western Kenya, the setting of much of the field research for this book—still experience regular interruptions in electricity, and smartphones are largely nonexistent. According to FSD Kenya, in 2016 only 16% of Kenyans owned a smartphone—a fact frequently forgotten in the race to become a fintech hub.

In Kenya’s urban settings, smartphone and Internet access are more common. Here, the mobile money channel is increasingly used together with social connections on platforms such as Facebook. WhatsApp, the cross-platform instant messaging and voice over IP service offers text and media messaging, voice and video calls, and user location sharing. WhatsApp, I learned, was the main reason why the Nairobi dweller wanted a smartphone. It can be an achievable status marker: Chinese Huawei smartphones were widely advertised for around $60–$80 in 2016. By this time, the feature phone I had fondly kept since 2009 provoked concern, as it hardly connoted sufficient status. When visiting the doctor’s office in Rwanda in 2016, I was told, “Such a person as yourself should not have a phone like this.” The handy feature phones were now called kabambe (roughly, “little cute thing”) or mulika mwizi (“to shine light on a thief ”). They were sold for as little as $20—and still used.

I discovered the importance of kabambe when living with my sister-in-law Lillian in 2016 and 2017 in Kawangware, an area in the west of Nairobi. A high school teacher with two daughters in college, Lillian’s husband had died suddenly a few years earlier. Her Samsung smartphone stayed in a locked bedroom cabinet during the day, while she rose at four a.m. to commute across town to her school by public transportation, returning at close to nine every night. After dinner she unlocked the phone and connected to her WhatsApp groups and to Facebook on its generous screen.

Twice during my stays, Lillian’s kabambe—which she used during the day on her commute—was stolen at a crowded bus stop. I also was once on the city bus with several thieves, one of whom posed as a ticket collector. As they left in a rush, my seatmate discovered that his money and kabambe were missing. Although smartphones are widely advertised and sought after, they are rarely in view outside of upscale restaurants and spaces. Hopeful international start-ups with Internet-based products have not considered the contingencies of daily life in the city nicknamed “Nai-robbery.”

Instead of following an approach based on creating and installing apps on expensive smartphones, designers can use another medium—universal applications. Universal apps can reach people on any phone, including basic phones, and are particularly important for development initiatives. Universal apps include voice, SMS (Short Message Service), and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), which has the most design flexibility. M-Pesa and Safaricom’s group messaging service, Semeni, use USSD programming. Safaricom users have memorized many sets of star codes that allow them to query balances or perform other functions. However, USSD communication sessions have a set time duration, and many designers consider them limited. Regardless of which design approach they choose, digital commerce and finance start-ups are flocking to Nairobi’s growing fintech sector. Aside from digital microloans (see Chapter 4), digitizing agriculture is a big focus. I attended a reverse hackathon (technology redesign event) in Nairobi in 2017 as an anthropologist to crowdfunding start-up M-Changa (see Chapter 10). Here I met representatives from local companies who had come to help farmers get comfortable using digital financial products. The start-ups included iShamba (shamba means “farm”)—an information service for farmers; Cowsoko (soko means “market”)—for livestock e-commerce; Chomoka (“unleashed”)—record keeping for savings groups; and Maano, another virtual farmers’ market. Timiza digitizes microfinance group savings programs; Digicow enables farmers to make data-driven decisions about dairy production; AcreAfrica links them to insurance; Farmdrive, Digifarm, and many others provide them with loans. Data-driven agriculture could make credit and insurance much cheaper and more available and make a precarious and risky way of life more predictable. Many platforms such as Digifarm, a Safaricom partner, bundle end-toend services, offering credit, inputs like seeds and fertilizer and pricing and weather information, and improved access to a market through its Digisoko partner. For example, some platforms are managed by the buyers of, say, green beans meant for export to Europe; they sell the seeds, offer credit, and buy the finished product, and they work with individual farmers or with farming cooperatives. These platforms also bring together and control as much data as possible about clients, including social media use and financial behavior, along with farm productivity, weather, and geospatial data, all of which are used for credit scoring. Observers worry that this kind of pervasive data control could embed inequalities and disadvantage farmers who experience drought or those who lack other sources of income to repay loans. Over a buffet lunch, company representatives at the hackathon shared an extensive array of quite different concerns: their difficulties in advertising for, finding, and retaining customers. They bemoaned what they saw as the communicative limitations of SMS and USSD protocols: once customers have memorized star codes to interact with a mobile operator, they don’t like changing or learning new ones. Other problems they mentioned included, the inability to advertise, and problems with network connectivity. Digifarm, by far the largest of these agricultural digital finance platforms, has about one million users already subscribed and aims to enroll five million subscribers by 2022.

The hackathon event itself provides clues as to why such platforms fail to find customers. The gathering was held at a posh hotel in the upscale Westlands neighborhood of Nairobi. The farmers I met included a member of parliament, college students interested in commercial farming, and representatives of farming cooperatives. One farmer told me he had paid to take a 60-kilometer bus ride early that morning. Developers and farmers were paired up or put in small groups that tested apps or SMS scripts for opening accounts and communicating with providers. Little else of the experience or needs of farmers, particularly rural smallholders, was probed, such as the ongoing rural crises of landlessness, low productivity, climate change and food insecurity. The event focused on the Nairobi area and on commercial markets, especially international ones, and exemplified the reasons why so many apps and platforms fail to give target customers a reason to use them.

The most successful approach builds on what people are already doing. As the lessons of sambaza showed, remittances are the key, along with using the agent network to reach customers. Equity Bank became the largest bank in Kenya by scaling rapidly through its agent network and through mobile phone loans. And the agent network is indeed very capable of scaling across the continent. Consider the case of MFS Africa, which has grown one of the largest payment networks in Africa by building on the agent network. Dare Okoudjou is CEO of MFS Africa. Originally from the Ivory Coast, he began his career with MTN, the South African mobile network operator (MNO). Early on he realized that the problem of scaling African fintech would be interoperability. Interoperability refers to the fact that mobile money systems operated by different companies and in different countries were unable to communicate with each other. Interoperability severely limits people’s ability to send and receive money.

Okoudjou’s company, founded in 2015, gradually built a cross-border remittance product to connect the patchwork of MNOs across national boundaries. MFS Africa designed an application programming interface (API) that had the capacity to act as a messenger between the mobile money systems operated by different companies, thereby making it possible for MFS to draw more and more mobile service providers over time into the interoperable network provided by its API. Beginning in East Africa, where MFS Africa first applied their API to integrate MTN and M-Pesa transfers, the company has gradually integrated more and more MNOs and countries into its network. In 2020 MFS Africa’s partners included 22 MNOs in 27 African countries, and together this network can reach 180 million mobile money customers through 2 million cash-in/cash-out agents. The network also includes money transfer operators like World Remit, as well as banks, fintechs and companies that want to pay commissions or salaries.

Okoudjou’s goal is to eventually connect all mobile money agents in Africa and to provide the interoperability that can lower costs. He works with “the reality . . . that the vast majority of people across sub-Saharan Africa are still using feature phones, or even more basic phones.” He explained that many innovators don’t want to work with the USSD communication language of these phones:

North of the Limpopo, people use USSD, which is a very rudimentary channel to try to do any type of service. The ability to work on a channel that is very unfriendly to developers is something that is really quite unique to the rest of the continent. . . . In the United States, Europe, even Cape Town, they wonder, why don’t you just do an App when you are doing money transfer?

In a SoundCloud interview, he elaborated on the difficulties of sustaining two-way communication between agents and mobile network operators to enable cross-border money transfers, all while complying with identity and antimoney laundering regulations:

[USSD] is a very rudimentary channel. You have to get things done in 45 seconds or the channel will close. You still wanna get forex through, the customer confirm, the kyc check, the aml check.25 You do not know when the electricity will go off, or if the servers will go off. When it rains transactions won’t go through because some links to internet are still running on VSAT.26 If [it] is raining you will get so many complaints.

As an innovator, Okoudjou is committed to working with the agent network. “At the end of the day digital money in Africa was not about the technology but about the agents,” he noted at a 2018 conference, where he emphasized that African fintech companies, to scale their products, must perfect their service and experience with accessible and universal SMS/USSD communication protocols if they want to reach a broad range of customers.

Agents and cash-out services are still fundamental. The realities of cost, access, uptake and usage, and Internet and smartphone use question the leapfrogging imagery. Instead, innovators are charting an African path to money. As Okoudjou said, “If we can operate in this environment imagine what there will be [for Africa]—when we have infrastructure.” Okoudjou is innovating in the context he has to work with now. He is imagining a better money infrastructure in the future, and building towards it in the present.",Hitting the Books: Kenya's digital divide is hampering its mobile money revolution
