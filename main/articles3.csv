Jesse Jackson has been released to a physical therapy center following gallbladder surgery

CHICAGO -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson has been released to a Chicago physical therapy center following gallbladder surgery and medical observation, a spokesman said Sunday.

The 79-year-old civil rights leader experienced “abdominal discomfort” on Jan. 29 and was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he underwent an undisclosed surgery, according to a late Saturday statement from Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson's longtime spokesman Frank Watkins confirmed Sunday it was gallbladder surgery.

Jackson has since been released to a rehabilitation center for a “short period of exercise and therapy,"" because of his Parkinson’s disease, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson has been seeking outpatient care for more than five years for Parkinson’s, a chronic neurological disorder that causes movement difficulties.

“Rev. Jackson is continuing his civil rights and organizational work and is in high spirits,” the organization's statement said. ""He’s expected to be home with his family shortly.""

A protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jackson was key in guiding the modern civil rights movement on numerous issues, including voting rights. Jackson has remained active, most recently advocating for COVID-19 vaccines for Black people, who lag behind white people in the United States' vaccination drive.

Jackson got his first dose of the vaccine last month during a publicized event at a South Side hospital. He urged others to vaccinate as soon as possible.

The 34-year-old rapper, whose legal name is Caswell Senior, will be disciplined by officials at the Westchester County Jail after a woman recorded him accepting the so-called Junebug challenge during a video visit, the Journal News reported.

The challenge asks TikTok users to perform a set of moves in the strangest location they can think of. The woman recorded Casanova dancing in jail and posted it on Instagram, the newspaper reported.

Westchester County Correction Commissioner Joseph Spano said correction officials have revoked Casanova's video visitation privileges because recording videos and taking pictures during a virtual visit is prohibited.

“I’m happy to say we don’t have a lot of issues with video visits because inmates know it’s a privilege, not a right,” Spano said.

Casanova faces another charge for not wearing a mask, authorities said.

Casanova's attorney, James Kousouros, noted that his client was not the one who posted the video and said he hopes the matter can be resolved without Casanova being cut off from video visits, the only way he can see his loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. Kousouros said Casanova was just “trying to keep his spirits up and have a laugh.""

Casanova was among 18 alleged members of the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation gang charged in a federal indictment in December with a host of crimes in New York City and elsewhere in New York state.

GREENWOOD, Miss. -- A trial has been postponed until April for a former Franciscan friar accused of molesting students in the 1990s at a Catholic school in Mississippi.

Paul West had been scheduled for trial in February. His case was delayed so he could undergo a mental evaluation, The Greenwood Commonwealth reported, citing dockets on the local district attorney's website.

A Leflore County grand jury indicted West in August on two counts of sexual battery and two counts of gratification of lust. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

This is the second time the case has been postponed since West pleaded innocent in September.

West’s attorney, Wallie Stuckey, said in November that he had not received all the information he’s legally due from the Mississippi attorney general's office about witnesses and evidence.

The indictments accuse West of molesting cousins Joshua Love and La Jarvis Love when they were students at St. Francis of Assisi School in Greenwood. West worked as a teacher and later as principal at the elementary school.

West also faces a charge in Wisconsin of second-degree sexual assault of a child.

The Associated Press reported in 2019 that the Catholic order of Franciscan Friars settled sex abuse cases by secretly paying Joshua Love and La Jarvis Love $15,000 each and requiring them to keep silent about their claims. The cash payments to the men, who are Black, were far less than what other Catholic sex abuse survivors have typically received since the church’s abuse scandal erupted in the United States in 2002.

“They felt they could treat us that way because we’re poor and we’re Black,” Joshua Love told the AP about the settlements he and his cousin received.

BOSTON -- A former private equity executive who cofounded an investment firm with U2's Bono agreed to plead guilty in connection to the college admissions bribery scheme.

William McGlashan will plead guilty to a single count of wire fraud and honest services wire fraud stemming from allegations that he paid $50,000 to have someone correct his son's ACT answers, federal prosecutors announced Friday.

Under a deal with prosecutors, McGlashan, 57, will serve three months in prison, complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $250,000 fine.

Prosecutors had also said he agreed with the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, Rick Singer, to pay $250,000 to try to get the teen into the University of Southern California as a football recruit but didn’t go through with it.

McGlashan has fiercely denied the charges and says he told Singer he didn’t want to participate in the so-called “side door” scheme. McGlashan’s lawyers have said in court documents that his son applied as a legitimate candidate and withdrew his application before he was even admitted.

McGlashan, who lives in California, is a former managing partner at TPG Capital who cofounded an investment fund with U2 singer Bono in 2017.

Attorneys for McGlashan declined to comment Sunday.

A hearing on the plea deal has not been scheduled. If the plea and sentencing agreement is approved, McGlashan will be the 30th parent to plead guilty to charges related to the college admissions case.

Some parents are accused of paying Singer to falsely portray their children as star athletes and then bribe college sports officials to get them admitted as recruited athletes at top universities. Others are accused of paying Singer to help cheat on their children’s SAT and ACT exams.

WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is withdrawing the U.S. from agreements with three Central American countries that restricted the ability of people to seek asylum at the southwest border, part of a broad effort to undo the the immigration policies of President Donald Trump

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday the administration had notified El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that it had started the formal process of terminating agreements that had been part of Trump's effort to restrict asylum.

The agreements, which had been on hold since early in the coronavirus pandemic, required many people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to go instead to one of the three Central American countries and pursue their claims there.

“The Biden administration believes there are more suitable ways to work with our partner governments to manage migration across the region,” Blinken said in a statement announcing the immediate suspension of the agreements and their eventual termination.

The secretary of state said the administration intends to work with the Central American nations to reduce some of the insecurity and poverty that cause people to flee in the first place while maintaining the security of the U.S. border.

“To be clear, these actions do not mean that the U.S. border is open,” he said. “While we are committed to expanding legal pathways for protection and opportunity here and in the region, the United States is a country with borders and laws that must be enforced.”

The Trump administration pushed the Central American nations to accept the agreements as a way to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the United States. Critics said it amounted to a U.S. retreat from its obligations under international law to help people fleeing persecution since neither of the three countries could credibly provide refuge.

Since the start of the pandemic, the U.S. has been quickly expelling nearly everyone apprehended at the border or seeking asylum under a public health law to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders Tuesday that ended Trump immigration policies or put them under review. He also set up a task force to reunite Central American families who had been forcibly separated at the border under a zero-tolerance program in 2018.",Biden ending deals with Central America restricting asylum

Two weather stories continue to unfold across the U.S. this weekend, one being a winter storm moving into the northeast and the other being polar air in the midwest that will linger through the week.

The trailing cold front from the storm is bringing some severe weather to parts of Florida and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the state until 7 a.m., including Tampa Bay which is hosting the Super Bowl.

Heavy snow moved through the mid-Atlantic and began to push into the major northeast cities Sunday morning.

Snow accumulated from the Appalachian Mountains and along much of the I-95 corridor into New England.

Snowfall rates could reach 2 inches per hour on Sunday, with the biggest snow totals occurring just outside big cities in the northeast.

More than half a foot of snow is being reported northwest of Philadelphia and New York City.

New York City has gotten about three inches of snow so far, while Philadelphia and Baltimore have gotten an inch.

The storm is expected to leave the region in the early evening hours, but dangerous travel conditions will remain.

Lingering precipitation is expected from southeastern New England and up the coast to eastern Maine through the evening and will wrap up by midnight.

Life-threatening wind chills continues to dominate the midwest with wind chills reaching as low as -50.

Wind chills this morning in major cities like Chicago and Indianapolis are well below zero and even parts of the south are getting some of the coldest air of the season with wind chills in the teens and single digits.

The main weather story though will be the brutally cold air that will persist over the central U.S.

Several disturbances will ride the jet stream at the edge of this brutally cold air and bring quick-moving hits of snow across parts of the midwest and northeast this week.

Toward the end of the week, a few more organized systems could bring some widespread winter weather impacts.

The brutally cold air looks like it will expand its grip significantly by the end of the week and will dominate much of the eastern and central U.S. with the East Coast and southern regions seeing well below average temperatures.","Snow moves into the Northeast, brutally cold air to persist in the Midwest"
"['Abc News', 'Tim Dahlberg Ap Boxing Writer', 'February']",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/heavyweight-champion-leon-spinks-jr-dies-67-75732492,[],Former heavyweight champion Leon Spinks has died after battling prostate and other cancers,"['Sports', 'Obituaries', 'Boxing', 'Montreal', 'Quebec', 'Canada', 'North America']",en,,https://abcnews.go.com,,set(),"LAS VEGAS -- Leon Spinks, who won Olympic gold and then shocked the boxing world by beating Muhammad Ali to win the heavyweight title in only his eighth pro fight, has died. He was 67.

Spinks, who lived his later years in Las Vegas, died Friday night, according to a release from a public relations firm. He had been battling prostate and other cancers.

His wife, Brenda Glur Spinks, and a few close friends and other family members were by his side when he passed away.

A lovable heavyweight with a drinking problem, Spinks beat Ali by decision in a 15-round fight in 1978 to win the title. He was unranked at the time, and picked as an opponent because Ali was looking for an easy fight.

He got anything but that, with an unorthodox Spinks swarming over Ali throughout the fight on his way to a stunning win by split decision. The two met seven months later at the Superdome in New Orleans, with Ali taking the decision this time before a record indoor boxing crowd of 72,000 and a national television audience estimated at 90 million people.

“It was one of the most unbelievable things when Ali agreed to fight him because you look at the fights he had up to then and he was not only not a top contender but shouldn’t have been a contender at all,’’ promoter Bob Arum said Saturday. ”He was just an opponent but somehow he found a way to win that fight.""

Spinks would lose the rematch to Ali in New Orleans and fought for the title only once after that, when he was stopped in the third round in 1981 by Larry Holmes. He continued fighting on and off into the mid-1990s, finishing with a record of 26-17-3.

Spinks, with a big grin that often showed off his missing front teeth, was popular among boxing fans for both his win over Ali and his easygoing personality. But he burned through his earnings quickly, and at one point after retiring was working as a custodian at a YMCA in Nebraska, cleaning locker rooms.

He later was part of a group of ex-fighters who had their brains studied by the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. Spinks was found to have brain damage caused by a combination of taking punches to the head and heavy drinking, though he functioned well enough to do autograph sessions and other events late in his life.

“He was a good soul,” said Gene Kilroy, who was Ali’s business manager when he fought Spinks and became friends with the fighter.

Spinks won the light heavyweight division at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, beating Sixto Soria of Cuba in an upset to become one of five U.S. fighters to win gold. His brother, Michael, who would later become heavyweight champion himself, won the middleweight gold, and Sugar Ray Leonard took the welterweight title.

Spinks was hardly spectacular after turning pro, winning six of his first seven fights. Just four months before he met Ali, he could manage just a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux and he wasn’t on anyone’s radar in the heavyweight title picture.

But Ali was coming off a brutal fight with Earnie Shavers and wasn’t looking forward to what would have been a mandatory bout against Ken Norton, whom he had already fought three times and who seemed to have Ali’s number. Instead, he sought an easy mark for a fight that was to be nationally televised on ABC, even knowing he would be stripped of one of his titles for taking another fight.

Enter Spinks, who was such a big underdog most sports books didn’t even take bets on the fight.

“In that fight everything clicked,” Arum said. “He came in with a game plan and he beat Ali. It wasn’t that Ali wasn’t at his best, but Leon shocked everybody with how good Leon was.”

Suddenly, Spinks was the heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 25.

“I'm not The Greatest,” Spinks said afterward. “Just the latest.”

Arum was in the dressing room with Ali after the fight, and said Ali directed him to sign Spinks to a quick rematch. The two fought seven months later in a prime-time fight on CBS that set television viewing records at the time, with nearly half the country tuning in.

Ali took the rematch more seriously than he did the first fight, winning a decision though Spinks was competitive. Spinks might have been better, Arum said, but enjoyed the life of being heavyweight champion too much and partied much of the time between fights.

“Leon posed in a bathtub with a glass of champagne smoking a cigar. He suddenly had an entourage as big as one that Ali had,” Arum said. “We were all staying at the same hotel in New Orleans for the rematch and one morning I was coming down to breakfast and Leon got in the elevator and collapsed on the floor. Obviously he had been out drinking and I said, `Leon, are you crazy, you’re fighting in just a few days.’ He said `What do you mean? I’m just coming in from roadwork.'”

Among the notable people in Spinks’ entourage was Lawrence Tureaud, who would later be known as the actor Mr. T and served as bodyguard for the champion.

Spinks was born July 11, 1953, in St. Louis, raised in poverty along with his brother Michael. After discovering boxing both brothers became top amateurs, culminating in the 1976 Olympics where Leon won the light heavyweight gold and Michael won the middleweight gold.

Michael Spinks would go on to win the heavyweight title himself in 1985, defending it three times before being knocked out by Mike Tyson in 91 seconds in their 1988 fight in Atlantic City. By then, the best part of Leon’s career was over, though he would fight until losing a December 1995 fight against Fred Houpe in St. Louis.

After moving to Las Vegas, Spinks was married to Brenda Glur Spinks in 2011. The two were often seen at boxing-related activities, including Spinks’ 2017 induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.

“He was happy go lucky, the salt of the earth,” Arum said, chuckling at the memories. “Leon was nutty but you couldn’t get angry at the guy. He never meant any harm to anyone. You couldn’t help but love him even though you shook your head at how he acted.”

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- After hurtling hundreds of millions of miles through space since last summer, three robotic explorers are ready to hit the brakes at Mars.

The stakes — and anxiety — are sky high.

The United Arab Emirates’ orbiter reaches Mars on Tuesday, followed less than 24 hours later by China’s orbiter-rover combo. NASA’s rover, the cosmic caboose, will arrive on the scene a week later, on Feb. 18, to collect rocks for return to Earth — a key step in determining whether life ever existed at Mars.

Both the UAE and China are newcomers at Mars, where more than half of Earth’s emissaries have failed. China’s first Mars mission, a joint effort with Russia in 2011, never made it past Earth’s orbit.

“We are quite excited as engineers and scientists, at the same time quite stressed and happy, worried, scared,” said Omran Sharaf, project manager for the UAE.

All three spacecraft rocketed away within days of one another last July, during an Earth-to-Mars launch window that occurs only every two years. That’s why their arrivals are also close together.

Called Amal, or Hope in Arabic, the Gulf nation's spacecraft is seeking an especially high orbit — 13,500 by 27,000 miles high (22,000 kilometers by 44,000 kilometers) — all the better to monitor the Martian weather.

China's duo — called Tianwen-1, or “Quest for Heavenly Truth” — will remain paired in orbit until May, when the rover separates to descend to the dusty, ruddy surface. If all goes well, it will be only the second country to land successfully on the red planet.

The U.S. rover Perseverance, by contrast, will dive in straight away for a harrowing sky-crane touchdown similar to the Curiosity rover’s grand Martian entrance in 2012. The odds are in NASA’s favor: It’s nailed eight of its nine attempted Mars landings.

Despite their differences — the 1-ton Perseverance is larger and more elaborate than the Tianwen-1 rover — both will prowl for signs of ancient microscopic life.

Perseverance’s $3 billion mission is the first leg in a U.S.-European effort to bring Mars samples to Earth in the next decade.

“To say we’re pumped about it, well that would be a huge understatement,” said Lori Glaze, NASA’s planetary science director.

Perseverance is aiming for an ancient river delta that seems a logical spot for once harboring life. This landing zone in Jezero Crater is so treacherous that NASA nixed it for Curiosity, but so tantalizing that scientists are keen to get hold of its rocks.

“When the scientists take a look at a site like Jezero Crater, they see the promise, right?” said Al Chen, who’s in charge of the entry, descent and landing team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “When I look at Jezero, I see danger. There’s danger everywhere.”

Steep cliffs, deep pits and fields of rocks could cripple or doom Perseverance, following its seven-minute atmospheric plunge. With an 11 1/2-minute communication lag each way, the rover will be on its own, unable to rely on flight controllers. Amal and Tianwen-1 will also need to operate autonomously while maneuvering into orbit.

Until Perseverance, NASA sought out flat, boring terrain on which to land — “one giant parking lot,” Chen said. That's what China's Tianwen-1 rover will be shooting for in Mars' Utopia Planitia.

NASA is upping its game thanks to new navigation technology designed to guide the rover to a safe spot. The spacecraft also has a slew of cameras and microphones to capture the sights and sounds of descent and landing, a Martian first.

Faster than previous Mars vehicles but still moving at a glacial pace, the six-wheeled Perseverance will drive across Jezero, collecting core samples of the most enticing rocks and gravel. The rover will set the samples aside for retrieval by a fetch rover launching in 2026.

Under an elaborate plan still being worked out by NASA and the European Space Agency, the geologic treasure would arrive on Earth in the early 2030s. Scientists contend it’s the only way to ascertain whether life flourished on a wet, watery Mars 3 billion to 4 billion years ago.

NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, considers it “one of the hardest things ever done by humanity and certainly in space science.”

The U.S. is still the only country to successfully land on Mars, beginning with the 1976 Vikings. Two spacecraft are still active on the surface: Curiosity and InSight.

Smashed Russian and European spacecraft litter the Martian landscape, meanwhile, along with NASA’s failed Mars Polar Lander from 1999.

Getting into orbit around Mars is less complicated, but still no easy matter, with about a dozen spacecraft falling short. Mars fly-bys were the rage in the 1960s and most failed; NASA’s Mariner 4 was the first to succeed in 1965.

Six spacecraft currently are operating around Mars: three from the U.S., two from Europe and one from India. The UAE hopes to make it seven with its $200-plus million mission.

The UAE is especially proud that Amal was designed and built by its own citizens, who partnered with the University of Colorado at Boulder and other U.S. institutions, not simply purchased from abroad. Its arrival at Mars coincides with this year’s 50th anniversary of the country’s founding.

China, hasn't divulged much in advance. Even the spacecraft's exact arrival time on Wednesday has yet to be announced.

The China Academy of Space Technology's Ye Peijian noted that Tianwen-1 has three objectives: orbiting the planet, landing and releasing the rover. If successful, he said in a statement “it will become the world's first Mars expedition accomplishing all three goals with one probe.”

The coronavirus pandemic has complicated each step of each spacecraft’s 300 million-mile (480 million-kilometer) journey to Mars. It even kept the European and Russian space agencies' joint Mars mission grounded until the next launch window in 2022.

The flight control rooms will contain fewer people on the big day, with staff spread over a wider area and working from home. Desks have dividers and partitions. Masks and social distancing are mandatory.

Perseverance's deputy project manager Matt Wallace, who’s working his fifth Mars rover mission, said the pandemic won’t dampen the mood come landing day.

“I don’t think COVID’s going to be able to stop us from jumping up and down, and fist-bumping,” he said. “You’re going to see a lot of happy people no matter what, once we get this thing on the surface safely.”

The avalanche occurred in a backcountry region of Millcreek Canyon. Eight skiers were in the area of Wilson Basin, which is not affiliated with any ski resorts, when they triggered the avalanche, Sgt. Melody Cutler of Millcreek's Unified Police Department said.

All eight were caught in the avalanche. A couple of skiers were able to dig themselves and the deceased skiers out, Cutler said.

Rescue crews were notified of the avalanche at 11:40 a.m. local time. The four survivors had minor injuries and were rescued via helicopter. Rescue teams were working to bring the deceased off the mountain, Cutler said.

The ages of the skiers range from early 20s to late 30s, Cutler said.

The accident occurred amid warnings of high avalanche danger for the region.

At 7 a.m. local time Saturday, the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center issued a backcountry avalanche warning for the mountains of northern Utah. It remains in effect through 6 a.m. Sunday.

Cutler stressed that it's important to pay attention to those warnings.

""There's been advisories out recently about the very high avalanche danger that exists with the current conditions,"" Cutler told Salt Lake City ABC affiliate KTVX. ""This is a very unfortunate circumstance with these conditions.""

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox reacted to news of the deadly avalanche on Twitter.

""This is a terrible tragedy and our prayers go out to the victims and families involved,"" he said. ""We are grateful to the first responders and others who engaged in this rescue and recovery effort. With avalanche danger high right now, please exercise extreme caution.""

The Salt Lake County Sheriff's Canyon Search and Rescue Unit, Unified Police Department, Unified Fire Authority and others were involved in the response, Mayor Jenny Wilson said.

""We are heartbroken over the tragic news of four fatalities as the result of an avalanche in the Millcreek Canyon area this afternoon,"" Wilson tweeted. ""We deeply mourn the loss of life due to this devastating incident.""

This is Utah's third fatal avalanche this year, according to the Utah Avalanche Center.

Two people died last month in separate avalanches in the Salt Lake region.

On Jan. 30, a 57-year-old man was killed while skiing in the backcountry adjacent to the Park City Mountain Resort's Canyons Village. Three weeks earlier, a 31-year-old snowboarder was buried after descending a slope with another skier in the backcountry of the Canyons Village area on Jan. 8.

All three avalanches were unintentionally triggered.

CHICAGO -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson has been released to a Chicago physical therapy center following gallbladder surgery and medical observation, a spokesman said Sunday.

The 79-year-old civil rights leader experienced “abdominal discomfort” on Jan. 29 and was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he underwent an undisclosed surgery, according to a late Saturday statement from Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson's longtime spokesman Frank Watkins confirmed Sunday it was gallbladder surgery.

Jackson has since been released to a rehabilitation center for a “short period of exercise and therapy,"" because of his Parkinson’s disease, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson has been seeking outpatient care for more than five years for Parkinson’s, a chronic neurological disorder that causes movement difficulties.

“Rev. Jackson is continuing his civil rights and organizational work and is in high spirits,” the organization's statement said. ""He’s expected to be home with his family shortly.""

A protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jackson was key in guiding the modern civil rights movement on numerous issues, including voting rights. Jackson has remained active, most recently advocating for COVID-19 vaccines for Black people, who lag behind white people in the United States' vaccination drive.

Jackson got his first dose of the vaccine last month during a publicized event at a South Side hospital. He urged others to vaccinate as soon as possible.

The 34-year-old rapper, whose legal name is Caswell Senior, will be disciplined by officials at the Westchester County Jail after a woman recorded him accepting the so-called Junebug challenge during a video visit, the Journal News reported.

The challenge asks TikTok users to perform a set of moves in the strangest location they can think of. The woman recorded Casanova dancing in jail and posted it on Instagram, the newspaper reported.

Westchester County Correction Commissioner Joseph Spano said correction officials have revoked Casanova's video visitation privileges because recording videos and taking pictures during a virtual visit is prohibited.

“I’m happy to say we don’t have a lot of issues with video visits because inmates know it’s a privilege, not a right,” Spano said.

Casanova faces another charge for not wearing a mask, authorities said.

Casanova's attorney, James Kousouros, noted that his client was not the one who posted the video and said he hopes the matter can be resolved without Casanova being cut off from video visits, the only way he can see his loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. Kousouros said Casanova was just “trying to keep his spirits up and have a laugh.""

Casanova was among 18 alleged members of the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation gang charged in a federal indictment in December with a host of crimes in New York City and elsewhere in New York state.

GREENWOOD, Miss. -- A trial has been postponed until April for a former Franciscan friar accused of molesting students in the 1990s at a Catholic school in Mississippi.

Paul West had been scheduled for trial in February. His case was delayed so he could undergo a mental evaluation, The Greenwood Commonwealth reported, citing dockets on the local district attorney's website.

A Leflore County grand jury indicted West in August on two counts of sexual battery and two counts of gratification of lust. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

This is the second time the case has been postponed since West pleaded innocent in September.

West’s attorney, Wallie Stuckey, said in November that he had not received all the information he’s legally due from the Mississippi attorney general's office about witnesses and evidence.

The indictments accuse West of molesting cousins Joshua Love and La Jarvis Love when they were students at St. Francis of Assisi School in Greenwood. West worked as a teacher and later as principal at the elementary school.

West also faces a charge in Wisconsin of second-degree sexual assault of a child.

The Associated Press reported in 2019 that the Catholic order of Franciscan Friars settled sex abuse cases by secretly paying Joshua Love and La Jarvis Love $15,000 each and requiring them to keep silent about their claims. The cash payments to the men, who are Black, were far less than what other Catholic sex abuse survivors have typically received since the church’s abuse scandal erupted in the United States in 2002.

“They felt they could treat us that way because we’re poor and we’re Black,” Joshua Love told the AP about the settlements he and his cousin received.

BOSTON -- A former private equity executive who cofounded an investment firm with U2's Bono agreed to plead guilty in connection to the college admissions bribery scheme.

William McGlashan will plead guilty to a single count of wire fraud and honest services wire fraud stemming from allegations that he paid $50,000 to have someone correct his son's ACT answers, federal prosecutors announced Friday.

Under a deal with prosecutors, McGlashan, 57, will serve three months in prison, complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $250,000 fine.

Prosecutors had also said he agreed with the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme, Rick Singer, to pay $250,000 to try to get the teen into the University of Southern California as a football recruit but didn’t go through with it.

McGlashan has fiercely denied the charges and says he told Singer he didn’t want to participate in the so-called “side door” scheme. McGlashan’s lawyers have said in court documents that his son applied as a legitimate candidate and withdrew his application before he was even admitted.

McGlashan, who lives in California, is a former managing partner at TPG Capital who cofounded an investment fund with U2 singer Bono in 2017.

Attorneys for McGlashan declined to comment Sunday.

A hearing on the plea deal has not been scheduled. If the plea and sentencing agreement is approved, McGlashan will be the 30th parent to plead guilty to charges related to the college admissions case.

Some parents are accused of paying Singer to falsely portray their children as star athletes and then bribe college sports officials to get them admitted as recruited athletes at top universities. Others are accused of paying Singer to help cheat on their children’s SAT and ACT exams.

WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is withdrawing the U.S. from agreements with three Central American countries that restricted the ability of people to seek asylum at the southwest border, part of a broad effort to undo the the immigration policies of President Donald Trump

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday the administration had notified El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that it had started the formal process of terminating agreements that had been part of Trump's effort to restrict asylum.

The agreements, which had been on hold since early in the coronavirus pandemic, required many people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to go instead to one of the three Central American countries and pursue their claims there.

“The Biden administration believes there are more suitable ways to work with our partner governments to manage migration across the region,” Blinken said in a statement announcing the immediate suspension of the agreements and their eventual termination.

The secretary of state said the administration intends to work with the Central American nations to reduce some of the insecurity and poverty that cause people to flee in the first place while maintaining the security of the U.S. border.

“To be clear, these actions do not mean that the U.S. border is open,” he said. “While we are committed to expanding legal pathways for protection and opportunity here and in the region, the United States is a country with borders and laws that must be enforced.”

The Trump administration pushed the Central American nations to accept the agreements as a way to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the United States. Critics said it amounted to a U.S. retreat from its obligations under international law to help people fleeing persecution since neither of the three countries could credibly provide refuge.

Since the start of the pandemic, the U.S. has been quickly expelling nearly everyone apprehended at the border or seeking asylum under a public health law to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders Tuesday that ended Trump immigration policies or put them under review. He also set up a task force to reunite Central American families who had been forcibly separated at the border under a zero-tolerance program in 2018.",Biden ending deals with Central America restricting asylum

Two weather stories continue to unfold across the U.S. this weekend, one being a winter storm moving into the northeast and the other being polar air in the midwest that will linger through the week.

The trailing cold front from the storm is bringing some severe weather to parts of Florida and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the state until 7 a.m., including Tampa Bay which is hosting the Super Bowl.

Heavy snow moved through the mid-Atlantic and began to push into the major northeast cities Sunday morning.

Snow accumulated from the Appalachian Mountains and along much of the I-95 corridor into New England.

Snowfall rates could reach 2 inches per hour on Sunday, with the biggest snow totals occurring just outside big cities in the northeast.

More than half a foot of snow is being reported northwest of Philadelphia and New York City.

New York City has gotten about three inches of snow so far, while Philadelphia and Baltimore have gotten an inch.

The storm is expected to leave the region in the early evening hours, but dangerous travel conditions will remain.

Lingering precipitation is expected from southeastern New England and up the coast to eastern Maine through the evening and will wrap up by midnight.

Life-threatening wind chills continues to dominate the midwest with wind chills reaching as low as -50.

Wind chills this morning in major cities like Chicago and Indianapolis are well below zero and even parts of the south are getting some of the coldest air of the season with wind chills in the teens and single digits.

The main weather story though will be the brutally cold air that will persist over the central U.S.

Several disturbances will ride the jet stream at the edge of this brutally cold air and bring quick-moving hits of snow across parts of the midwest and northeast this week.

Toward the end of the week, a few more organized systems could bring some widespread winter weather impacts.

The brutally cold air looks like it will expand its grip significantly by the end of the week and will dominate much of the eastern and central U.S. with the East Coast and southern regions seeing well below average temperatures.","Snow moves into the Northeast, brutally cold air to persist in the Midwest"
"['Abc News', 'Tim Dahlberg Ap Boxing Writer', 'February']",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/heavyweight-champion-leon-spinks-jr-dies-67-75732492,[],Former heavyweight champion Leon Spinks has died after battling prostate and other cancers,"['Sports', 'Obituaries', 'Boxing', 'Montreal', 'Quebec', 'Canada', 'North America']",en,,https://abcnews.go.com,,set(),"LAS VEGAS -- Leon Spinks, who won Olympic gold and then shocked the boxing world by beating Muhammad Ali to win the heavyweight title in only his eighth pro fight, has died. He was 67.

Spinks, who lived his later years in Las Vegas, died Friday night, according to a release from a public relations firm. He had been battling prostate and other cancers.

His wife, Brenda Glur Spinks, and a few close friends and other family members were by his side when he passed away.

A lovable heavyweight with a drinking problem, Spinks beat Ali by decision in a 15-round fight in 1978 to win the title. He was unranked at the time, and picked as an opponent because Ali was looking for an easy fight.

He got anything but that, with an unorthodox Spinks swarming over Ali throughout the fight on his way to a stunning win by split decision. The two met seven months later at the Superdome in New Orleans, with Ali taking the decision this time before a record indoor boxing crowd of 72,000 and a national television audience estimated at 90 million people.

“It was one of the most unbelievable things when Ali agreed to fight him because you look at the fights he had up to then and he was not only not a top contender but shouldn’t have been a contender at all,’’ promoter Bob Arum said Saturday. ”He was just an opponent but somehow he found a way to win that fight.""

Spinks would lose the rematch to Ali in New Orleans and fought for the title only once after that, when he was stopped in the third round in 1981 by Larry Holmes. He continued fighting on and off into the mid-1990s, finishing with a record of 26-17-3.

Spinks, with a big grin that often showed off his missing front teeth, was popular among boxing fans for both his win over Ali and his easygoing personality. But he burned through his earnings quickly, and at one point after retiring was working as a custodian at a YMCA in Nebraska, cleaning locker rooms.

He later was part of a group of ex-fighters who had their brains studied by the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. Spinks was found to have brain damage caused by a combination of taking punches to the head and heavy drinking, though he functioned well enough to do autograph sessions and other events late in his life.

“He was a good soul,” said Gene Kilroy, who was Ali’s business manager when he fought Spinks and became friends with the fighter.

Spinks won the light heavyweight division at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, beating Sixto Soria of Cuba in an upset to become one of five U.S. fighters to win gold. His brother, Michael, who would later become heavyweight champion himself, won the middleweight gold, and Sugar Ray Leonard took the welterweight title.

Spinks was hardly spectacular after turning pro, winning six of his first seven fights. Just four months before he met Ali, he could manage just a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux and he wasn’t on anyone’s radar in the heavyweight title picture.

But Ali was coming off a brutal fight with Earnie Shavers and wasn’t looking forward to what would have been a mandatory bout against Ken Norton, whom he had already fought three times and who seemed to have Ali’s number. Instead, he sought an easy mark for a fight that was to be nationally televised on ABC, even knowing he would be stripped of one of his titles for taking another fight.

Enter Spinks, who was such a big underdog most sports books didn’t even take bets on the fight.

“In that fight everything clicked,” Arum said. “He came in with a game plan and he beat Ali. It wasn’t that Ali wasn’t at his best, but Leon shocked everybody with how good Leon was.”

Suddenly, Spinks was the heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 25.

“I'm not The Greatest,” Spinks said afterward. “Just the latest.”

Arum was in the dressing room with Ali after the fight, and said Ali directed him to sign Spinks to a quick rematch. The two fought seven months later in a prime-time fight on CBS that set television viewing records at the time, with nearly half the country tuning in.

Ali took the rematch more seriously than he did the first fight, winning a decision though Spinks was competitive. Spinks might have been better, Arum said, but enjoyed the life of being heavyweight champion too much and partied much of the time between fights.

“Leon posed in a bathtub with a glass of champagne smoking a cigar. He suddenly had an entourage as big as one that Ali had,” Arum said. “We were all staying at the same hotel in New Orleans for the rematch and one morning I was coming down to breakfast and Leon got in the elevator and collapsed on the floor. Obviously he had been out drinking and I said, `Leon, are you crazy, you’re fighting in just a few days.’ He said `What do you mean? I’m just coming in from roadwork.'”

Among the notable people in Spinks’ entourage was Lawrence Tureaud, who would later be known as the actor Mr. T and served as bodyguard for the champion.

Spinks was born July 11, 1953, in St. Louis, raised in poverty along with his brother Michael. After discovering boxing both brothers became top amateurs, culminating in the 1976 Olympics where Leon won the light heavyweight gold and Michael won the middleweight gold.

Michael Spinks would go on to win the heavyweight title himself in 1985, defending it three times before being knocked out by Mike Tyson in 91 seconds in their 1988 fight in Atlantic City. By then, the best part of Leon’s career was over, though he would fight until losing a December 1995 fight against Fred Houpe in St. Louis.

After moving to Las Vegas, Spinks was married to Brenda Glur Spinks in 2011. The two were often seen at boxing-related activities, including Spinks’ 2017 induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.

“He was happy go lucky, the salt of the earth,” Arum said, chuckling at the memories. “Leon was nutty but you couldn’t get angry at the guy. He never meant any harm to anyone. You couldn’t help but love him even though you shook your head at how he acted.”

The stakes — and anxiety — are sky high.

The United Arab Emirates’ orbiter reaches Mars on Tuesday, followed less than 24 hours later by China’s orbiter-rover combo. NASA’s rover, the cosmic caboose, will arrive on the scene a week later, on Feb. 18, to collect rocks for return to Earth — a key step in determining whether life ever existed at Mars.

Both the UAE and China are newcomers at Mars, where more than half of Earth’s emissaries have failed. China’s first Mars mission, a joint effort with Russia in 2011, never made it past Earth’s orbit.

“We are quite excited as engineers and scientists, at the same time quite stressed and happy, worried, scared,” said Omran Sharaf, project manager for the UAE.

All three spacecraft rocketed away within days of one another last July, during an Earth-to-Mars launch window that occurs only every two years. That’s why their arrivals are also close together.

Called Amal, or Hope in Arabic, the Gulf nation's spacecraft is seeking an especially high orbit — 13,500 by 27,000 miles high (22,000 kilometers by 44,000 kilometers) — all the better to monitor the Martian weather.

China's duo — called Tianwen-1, or “Quest for Heavenly Truth” — will remain paired in orbit until May, when the rover separates to descend to the dusty, ruddy surface. If all goes well, it will be only the second country to land successfully on the red planet.

The U.S. rover Perseverance, by contrast, will dive in straight away for a harrowing sky-crane touchdown similar to the Curiosity rover’s grand Martian entrance in 2012. The odds are in NASA’s favor: It’s nailed eight of its nine attempted Mars landings.

Despite their differences — the 1-ton Perseverance is larger and more elaborate than the Tianwen-1 rover — both will prowl for signs of ancient microscopic life.

Perseverance’s $3 billion mission is the first leg in a U.S.-European effort to bring Mars samples to Earth in the next decade.

“To say we’re pumped about it, well that would be a huge understatement,” said Lori Glaze, NASA’s planetary science director.

Perseverance is aiming for an ancient river delta that seems a logical spot for once harboring life. This landing zone in Jezero Crater is so treacherous that NASA nixed it for Curiosity, but so tantalizing that scientists are keen to get hold of its rocks.

“When the scientists take a look at a site like Jezero Crater, they see the promise, right?” said Al Chen, who’s in charge of the entry, descent and landing team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “When I look at Jezero, I see danger. There’s danger everywhere.”

Steep cliffs, deep pits and fields of rocks could cripple or doom Perseverance, following its seven-minute atmospheric plunge. With an 11 1/2-minute communication lag each way, the rover will be on its own, unable to rely on flight controllers. Amal and Tianwen-1 will also need to operate autonomously while maneuvering into orbit.

Until Perseverance, NASA sought out flat, boring terrain on which to land — “one giant parking lot,” Chen said. That's what China's Tianwen-1 rover will be shooting for in Mars' Utopia Planitia.

NASA is upping its game thanks to new navigation technology designed to guide the rover to a safe spot. The spacecraft also has a slew of cameras and microphones to capture the sights and sounds of descent and landing, a Martian first.

Faster than previous Mars vehicles but still moving at a glacial pace, the six-wheeled Perseverance will drive across Jezero, collecting core samples of the most enticing rocks and gravel. The rover will set the samples aside for retrieval by a fetch rover launching in 2026.

Under an elaborate plan still being worked out by NASA and the European Space Agency, the geologic treasure would arrive on Earth in the early 2030s. Scientists contend it’s the only way to ascertain whether life flourished on a wet, watery Mars 3 billion to 4 billion years ago.

NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, considers it “one of the hardest things ever done by humanity and certainly in space science.”

The U.S. is still the only country to successfully land on Mars, beginning with the 1976 Vikings. Two spacecraft are still active on the surface: Curiosity and InSight.

Smashed Russian and European spacecraft litter the Martian landscape, meanwhile, along with NASA’s failed Mars Polar Lander from 1999.

Getting into orbit around Mars is less complicated, but still no easy matter, with about a dozen spacecraft falling short. Mars fly-bys were the rage in the 1960s and most failed; NASA’s Mariner 4 was the first to succeed in 1965.

Six spacecraft currently are operating around Mars: three from the U.S., two from Europe and one from India. The UAE hopes to make it seven with its $200-plus million mission.

The UAE is especially proud that Amal was designed and built by its own citizens, who partnered with the University of Colorado at Boulder and other U.S. institutions, not simply purchased from abroad. Its arrival at Mars coincides with this year’s 50th anniversary of the country’s founding.

“Starting off the year with this milestone is something very important for the people” of the UAE, said Sharaf.

China, hasn't divulged much in advance. Even the spacecraft's exact arrival time on Wednesday has yet to be announced.

The China Academy of Space Technology's Ye Peijian noted that Tianwen-1 has three objectives: orbiting the planet, landing and releasing the rover. If successful, he said in a statement “it will become the world's first Mars expedition accomplishing all three goals with one probe.”

The coronavirus pandemic has complicated each step of each spacecraft’s 300 million-mile (480 million-kilometer) journey to Mars. It even kept the European and Russian space agencies' joint Mars mission grounded until the next launch window in 2022.

The flight control rooms will contain fewer people on the big day, with staff spread over a wider area and working from home. Desks have dividers and partitions. Masks and social distancing are mandatory.

Perseverance's deputy project manager Matt Wallace, who’s working his fifth Mars rover mission, said the pandemic won’t dampen the mood come landing day.

“I don’t think COVID’s going to be able to stop us from jumping up and down, and fist-bumping,” he said. “You’re going to see a lot of happy people no matter what, once we get this thing on the surface safely.”

On Super Bowl Sunday, loved ones and colleagues of FBI special agent Daniel Aflin filed into Miami's Hard Rock Stadium to give the slain law enforcement officer a super send-off with a 21-gun salute, a bagpipe serenade, a police helicopter flyover and praise from the bureau's top official for tracking down and arresting ""monsters none of us would ever want to meet.""

Alfin's casket, covered in an American flag and followed by his widow, Jessie, and young son, Eli, was wheeled out to midfield on turf that is normally home for the NFL's Miami Dolphins but was transformed for the second consecutive day into an open-air sanctuary for the solemn service.

The funeral was held one day after a memorial service for FBI special agent Laura Schwartzenberger, 43, who along with the 36-year-old Alfin, were gunned down on Tuesday while serving a search warrant at the Sunrise, Florida, home of a child pornography suspect. Four other FBI agents were wounded in the ambush.

The suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said at Sunday's service that both Alfin and Schwartzenberger were ""cut from the same patriotic cloth.""

""On Tuesday, we lost not one of our own, but two, two warriors who took on one of the hardest jobs in the FBI -- crimes against children,"" said Wray, who also spoke at Schwartzenberger's service on Saturday.

He said Alfin and Schwartznberger were two best friends ""who shared the same passion, the same determination and, in spite of all they witnessed in their extraordinary careers, the same sense of optimism and hope that comes from work that matters.""

Wray said Alfin joined the FBI in 2009, starting in the bureau's Albany, New York, field office.

He described Alfin as a ""true American hero"" who was full of ""passion for fighting for children every single day."" He said Alfin, who was also a member of the FBI's dive team, was an innovator with an unsurpassed understanding of the technical side of crimes against children.

Alfin, according to Wrey, played a major role in fighting crime against children internationally, training the FBI's global partners. He said Alfin's team won an FBI Director's Award, the bureau's highest honor, for their work on ""Operation Pacifier,"" in which he and other agents took down one of the largest child exploitation sites on the dark web.

""Its users were the worst of the worst, the stuff of nightmares. And Dan's expertise helped identify them and stop the victimization of so many innocent children,"" Wray said. ""Dan was both the primary case agent and the driving force behind that operation, which still stands as the FBI's most successful operation conducted on the dark web against online child sex offenders ever.""

Alfin's brother, Denis Alfin, recalled his sibling's sharp intellect and a dry wit.

""In honoring Daniel today, we are not just saying goodbye to a colleague, a friend, a brother, a son, a father, or a husband, but we are collectively ensuring his memory lives on,"" Denis Alfin said. ""As law enforcement officers and first responders, you selflessly put the lives of others before your own. As you continue to protect our communities, you will keep a part of Daniel alive.""

During the service, Wray presented the flag that had covered Alfin's casket to his widow.

Before the service ended with a police helicopter flyover and with a riderless horse being trotted onto the field and next to Alfin's casket, Father James Quinn, chaplain of the FBI Miami field office, cited scripture saying ""God will bless the peacemakers.""

Which COVID-19 tests are required for international travel?

It depends on where you're going.

In an effort to limit the spread of new coronavirus variants, many countries are requiring incoming travelers to show a recent negative test.

The U.S., for example, will accept results from either a test that detects the genetic material of the virus — considered the most sensitive type of test — or a rapid test that looks for viral proteins called antigens. The tests must have been taken no more than three days before departing for the U.S.

Health professionals usually give more sensitive lab tests via a nasal swab that take a day or more to yield results. Rapid tests have a turnaround time of about 15 to 30 minutes and are increasingly used to screen people at testing sites, offices, schools and nursing homes. For some rapid tests, users can swab themselves at home.

With either test, the U.S. requires electronic or printed proof of the negative result from a medical laboratory. That means that even if you plan to get the faster test you’ll likely need to see a health care provider who can provide documentation.

England has a similar setup, accepting results from both types of tests. But health authorities there are imposing extra requirements, including that the tests meet certain thresholds for accuracy. Travelers are told to check to make sure their test meets the standards.

After countries instituted varying requirements, officials in the European Union agreed to standardize requirements across the 27-nation bloc.

YANGON, Myanmar -- As enthusiastic crowds of tens of thousands marched through the streets of Myanmar’s biggest city on Sunday to protest last week’s coup ousting Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, their spirits were lifted by the return of internet services that had been blocked a day earlier.

Separate protests that began in various parts of Yangon converged at Sule Pagoda, situated in the center of a roundabout in the city’s downtown area. Protesters chanted “Long live Mother Suu” and “Down with military dictatorship.” Protesters in other parts of the country echoed their calls.

Authorities had cut access to the internet as the protests grew Saturday, fanning fears of a complete information blackout. On Sunday afternoon, however, internet users in Yangon reported that data access on their mobile phones had suddenly been restored.

The demonstrators are seeking to roll back last Monday’s seizure of power by the military and demanding the release from detention of Suu Kyi, the country’s ousted leader, and other top figures from her National League for Democracy party.

The military has accused Suu Kyi's government of failing to act on its complaints that last November’s election was marred by fraud, though the election commission said it had found no evidence to support the claims.

The growing protests are a sharp reminder of the long and bloody struggle for democracy in a country that the military ruled directly for more than five decades before loosening its grip in 2012. Suu Kyi's government, which won a landslide election in 2015, was the first led by civilians in decades, though it faced a number of curbs to its power under a military-drafted constitution.

During Myanmar's years of isolation under military rule, the golden-domed Sule Pagoda served as a rallying point for political protests calling for democracy, most notably in during a massive 1988 uprising and again during a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks.

The military used to deadly force to end both of those uprisings, with estimates of hundreds if not thousands killed in 1988. While riot police have been sent to watch the protests this past week, soldiers have been absent and there have been no reports of clashes.

Several videos posted online Sunday that were said to be from the town of Myawaddy, on Myanmar’s eastern border with Thailand, showed police shooting into the air in an evident effort to disperse a crowd. There were no signs of panic and no reports of injuries.

Showing little fear, protest crowds have grown bigger and bolder in recent days, while remaining nonviolent in support of a call by Suu Kyi's party and its allies for civil disobedience.

In one of Sunday's gatherings, at least 2,000 labor union and student activists and members of the public gathered at a major intersection near Yangon University. They marched along a main road, snarling traffic. Drivers honked their horns in support.

Police in riot gear blocked the main entrance to the university. Two water cannon trucks were parked nearby.

The mostly young protesters held placards calling for freedom for Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, who were put under house arrest and charged with minor offenses, seen by many as providing a legal veneer for their detention.

“We just want to show this current generation how the older generation fights this crisis, by heeding the guideline of Mother Suu, which is to be honest, transparent and peaceful,"" said 46-year-old protester Htain Linn Aung. “We don’t want a military dictator. Let the dictator fail.”

Reports on social media and by some Myanmar news services said demonstrations were taking place in other parts of the country as well, with a particularly large crowd in the central city of Mandalay, where there was also a motorbike procession in which hundreds took part, constantly beeping their horns.

Saturday had seen the size of street protests grow from the hundreds to the thousands, but it also saw the authorities cut most access to the internet. Holes in the military’s firewall allowed some news to trickle out, but also fanned fears of a complete information blackout.

Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter were earlier ordered blocked, but had remained partially accessible. Social media platforms have been major sources of independent news as well as organizing tools for protests.

Netblocks, a London-based service that tracks internet disruptions and shutdowns, confirmed that there had been a partial restoration of internet connectivity on Sunday, but noted that it might be temporary and social media remined blocked.

The communication blockade was a stark reminder of the progress Myanmar is in danger of losing. During Myanmar’s decades of military rule, the country was internationally isolated and communication with the outside world strictly controlled.

The elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s party met in an online meeting Friday to declare themselves as the sole legitimate representatives of the people and asked for international recognition as the country’s government.

Pope Francis joined the international chorus of concern over the situation.

In remarks to the public in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday, the pope said he has been following “with strong worry the situation that has developed in Myanmar,” noting his affection for the country since his visit there in 2017.

He said he hoped that Myanmar's leaders worked sincerely “to promote social justice and national stability for a harmonious democratic co-existence.”",Internet access restored as Myanmar coup protests grow

BEIJING — China appears to have stamped out its latest coronavirus outbreaks centered on the northeast, reporting no new cases of local infection in its latest daily report.

The National Health Commission said Monday that 14 newly confirmed cases had been brought from outside the country but no new cases were registered in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin that have seen China’s latest clusters.

While China has relaxed some social distancing rules, extensive testing, electronic monitoring and periodic lockdowns remain in place.

The country has reported 4,636 deaths among almost 90,000 cases since the coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.

THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:

The UK's aggressive vaccine gambles have paid off, while EU caution is slowing down its vaccination program. The West African country of Burkina Faso, which at first managed to avoid a catastrophic surge of the coronavirus, is now trying to cope with a much deadlier resurgence. Some California churches opened their doors to worshippers after the state revised its guidelines for houses of prayer following a Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on indoor services. And more Americans are deciding to have their terminally ill loved ones die at home rather than in nursing home and hospice settings, fearful of having to say farewell to loved ones behind glass or during video calls.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s daily tally of newly confirmed coronavirus cases has fallen below 300 for the first time in more than two months as authorities slightly ease tough physical distancing rules in the country.

Authorities on Monday reported 289 new infections in the past 24-hour period. That is the first time the daily number has been under 300 since Nov. 23.

South Korea’s virus caseload has gradually slowed in recent weeks amid stringent social distancing rules.

On Monday, officials began allowing restaurants, coffee shops, indoor gyms and other facilities outside the densely populous Seoul metropolitan region to stay open an hour longer. Authorities say they’ll maintain a ban on social gatherings of five or more people throughout the Lunar New Year holidays.

JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its front-line health care workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested that it isn’t effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in the country.

South Africa received its first 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week and was expected to begin giving jabs to health care workers in mid-February. The disappointing early results indicate that an inoculation drive using the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful.

The trial results, which aren’t yet peer-reviewed, suggested the AstraZeneca vaccine “provides minimal protection against mild-moderate COVID-19 infection” among young adults exposed to the South Africa variant.

Oxford University and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg said in a statement that protection against more severe forms of the disease could not be assessed in the trial because those participating were at low risk.

The variant appears more infectious and is driving a deadly resurgence of the disease in the country, currently accounting for more than 90% of the COVID-19 cases, health minister Zweli Mkhize said Sunday night.

LOS ANGELES -- Some California churches opened their doors to worshippers after the state revised its guidelines for houses of prayer following a Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on indoor services during the coronavirus pandemic.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office issued revised guidelines that limit attendance at indoor services in areas with widespread or substantial virus spread. In the most significant legal victory against California’s COVID-19 health orders, the high court said the state couldn’t continue a ban on indoor services, but it can limit attendance to 25% of a building’s capacity and restrict singing inside.

The court was acting on emergency requests to halt the restrictions from Pasadena-based Harvest Rock and Harvest International Ministry, which has more than 160 churches across the state, along with South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista.

Che Ahn, Harvest Rock’s senior pastor, told his congregation that the church would defy the ban on singing. Worshippers without masks could be seen on the livestream raising their arms and singing out loud. It wasn’t clear how many people were inside the church, which seats hundreds.

LOS ANGELES -- California’s coronavirus picture remains much improved, but officials expressed concern that Super Bowl gatherings could erase gains made over the past several weeks.

The California Department of Public Health urged residents not to gather for the big game.

The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 slipped below 11,670 statewide, a drop of nearly 35% in two weeks. The 15,064 new confirmed cases on Sunday represent a drop of more than 30% from the mid-December peak.

Deaths also are starting to fall but remain alarmingly high, however, with a daily average of 511 over the past two weeks. There were 295 deaths reported Sunday.

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has resumed greeting the public in St. Peter’s Square, seven weeks after he interrupted the Sunday noon ritual to discourage crowds from gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Smiling broadly, Francis appeared at an Apostolic Palace window overlooking the square and greeted a couple of hundred people standing a safe distance apart in the cobblestone square. Most held umbrellas on a drizzly, windy day.

“In the square again!” Francis said. He appeared on the first Sunday since the Rome area regained Italy’s “yellow zone’’ designation, which carries the least restrictions on movement.

Normally thousands of pilgrims, tourists and locals would turn out in the vast square on Sundays to hear the pope. But Italy isn’t allowing travel between regions in the country, and with stringent measures discouraging arrivals from overseas, tourism and pilgrimages have practically evaporated.

LONDON — The developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine expect to have a modified jab to cope with the South Africa coronavirus variant by autumn, the vaccine’s lead researcher said Sunday.

Health officials in Britain are trying to contain the spread of the variant first identified in South Africa amid concerns that it is more contagious or resistant to existing vaccines. More than 100 cases of the South African variant have been found in the U.K.

Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher for the Oxford team, told the BBC on Sunday that “we have a version with the South African spike sequence in the works.”

“It looks very likely that we can have a new version ready to use in the autumn,” she added.

Her comments came as Oxford University said that early data from a small study suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers only “minimal protection” against mild disease caused by the South Africa variant. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, involved 2,000 people, most of whom were young and healthy.

HELSINKI — Norway says it will apply, effective Sunday, stricter coronavirus restrictions in the southwestern coastal municipality of Bergen and twelve surrounding areas to due to a spread of new COVID-19 variants first detected in Britain and South Africa.

Norwegian health officials said the restrictions mean, among other things, that all events outside home are prohibited with a few exceptions including funerals.

Schools are required to switch to remote teaching and universities will close for students. Officials said residents of the 13 areas should work remotely from home as much as possible and most shops will be closed.

The restrictions will apply from 6 pm Sunday for one week.

Some 315 cases of the British and South African variants of COVID-19 have so far been detected in Norway. On Saturday, eight additional cases of the new COVID-19 variants were recorded in the Bergen region

TEHRAN, Iran — Iran has unveiled its second homemade coronavirus vaccine and says it has begun human trials, state TV reported Sunday.

The Razi Cov Pars vaccine manufactured by the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute is both injectable and inhalable. Ali Eshaqi, the institute’s manager, said the vaccine will be tested on 13 people within eight days and then if there are no serious reactions, it will be tested on groups of 20 to 120 persons.

Eshaqi said the vaccine has already been tested on animals including mice, rabbits, hamsters and monkeys. The country is also working on a joint vaccine with Cuba.

Iran plans to import 17 million doses of vaccine from the international COVAX program and millions more from other countries.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Some 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine arrived Sunday in Afghanistan from the government in India.

The news was announced by Wahid Majroh, acting public health minister.

Ghulam Dastagir Nazari, an official from the public health ministry, said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is from the Serum Institute of India and is the first to arrive in the country.

Afghanistan will store the vaccine until it gets approval from the World Health Organization and then it will give it first to front-line health workers and the elderly, said Majroh.

Afghanistan has recorded 55,300 positive cases and 2,410 deaths. Experts say a lack of testing and missed cases have lead to undercounting the toll of the virus around the world.

JERUSALEM — Israel has started to ease restrictions nearly six weeks after entering its third nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Some businesses began reopening on Sunday and people are now allowed to move more than a kilometer (half a mile) from their homes. But schools remain shuttered and international flights are severely restricted.

Israel instituted its third national lockdown in late December as new infections spiraled out of control. Israel has recorded over 686,000 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic last year and 5,074 deaths, according to Health Ministry figures.

At the same time, the country has launched a major vaccination campaign. More than 3.4 million Israelis have received the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine, and at least 2 million have received a second dose.

CAIRO — Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi says his country needs 70 millions shots of coronavirus vaccine to inoculate between 30-35 million people in the first stage of a campaign his government launched last month.

El-Sissi said in televised comments late Saturday that the first stage of the country’s vaccination campaign targets health care workers, elderly people and those suffering from chronic diseases.

The Egyptian leader, however, said the response among health care workers has been between 45% and 50%. “There are people who say we do not want” to be vaccinated, he said.

The Arab world’s most populous country with more than 100 million people, Egypt received a 50,000-dose shipment of the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine in December and another 50,000-dose shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines last month.

The government has said it reserved 100 million doses of the approved vaccines, according to the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Haitian President Jovenel Moïse announced Sunday that police have arrested more than 20 people he accused of trying to kill him and overthrow his government, including a Supreme Court judge who has the support of opposition leaders demanding that Moïse step down.

Moïse spoke at Haiti’s airport in Port-au-Prince, flanked by the country’s prime minister and the police chief as he prepared to leave for the southern coastal town of Jacmel for the opening ceremony of its yearly carnival, which is being held amid the pandemic.

“There was an attempt on my life,” he said.

Moïse said the alleged plot began Nov. 20 but did not provide further details or any evidence except to say among the people arrested is a judge and an inspector general with the police. Moïse then said other high-ranking officials would provide more information.

Prime Minister Joseph Joute said later in the day that authorities found several weapons and a speech that Supreme Court Judge Yvickel Dabrézil had allegedly prepared if he were to become provisional president. Dabrézil is one of three judges that the opposition favors as a potential transitional president.

Meanwhile, Justice Minister Rockefeller Vincent accused the inspector general of being in touch with high-ranking security officials at the National Palace over an alleged plot to have the president arrested.

André Michel, one of Haiti's top opposition leaders, held a press conference hours after the arrests and called for civil disobedience and demanded that Moïse be arrested. Michel, an attorney, said it was illegal to arrest Dabrézil because he has automatic immunity.

Reynold Georges, an attorney who once worked as a consultant for Moïse's administration but has since joined the opposition, denounced the arrests in an interview with radio station Zenith FM.

“We ask for his release immediately,” he said of Dabrézil, adding that the court system should shut down until he's free.

Georges also called on people to rise up against Moïse.

Also arrested was Police General Inspector Antoinette Gauthier, according to a statement from the Young Bar Association of Port-au-Prince, which accused Moïse's administration of sowing terror and said Sunday's actions should not be tolerated.

The arrests come on the day that opposition leaders claim Moïse should resign, saying that his term ends on Sunday. Moïse has repeatedly stated that his five-year term ends in February 2022. Former President Michel Martelly’s term ended in 2016, but a chaotic election forced the appointment of a provisional president for one year until Moïse was sworn in in 2017.

The opposition has organized recent protests demanding that Moïse step down, and normally congested streets in Haiti’s capital and elsewhere remained empty on Sunday except for some 100 protesters who gathered in Port-au-Prince and clashed with police. Historians noted that exactly 35 years ago, former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and his wife fled Haiti with help from the U.S. government amid a popular uprising. Duvalier died in 2014.

Meanwhile, Moïse appears to have the support of the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. Ned Price, a U.S. State Department spokesman, said Friday that the U.S. has urged Haiti to organize free and fair elections so that Parliament can resume operations, adding that a new elected president should succeed Moïse when his terms ends in February 2022.

Moïse is currently ruling by decree after dissolving a majority of Parliament in January 2020 after no legislative elections were held. He is planning an upcoming constitutional referendum in April that critics say could award him more power, while general elections are scheduled for later this year.

After arriving in Jacmel, Moïse broadcast an address that lasted more than an hour. He spoke largely about the infrastructure projects that his administration has accomplished, but also called on the opposition to work with him.

“It's not too late,” he said, rejecting accusations that he is on his way to becoming a dictator. “I’m not a dictator. Dictators are people who take power and don’t know when they’re leaving. I know my mandate ends on Feb. 7, 2022.”

KYIV, Ukraine -- Winter's cold and harsh police actions in Belarus have put a chill on the protests against President Alexander Lukashenko that gripped the Eastern European nation for months. But opposition forces are preparing to turn up the heat in the spring and observers say Lukashenko doesn't have a clear strategy to overcome new unrest.

Here's a look at the country's situation six months after the start of an unprecedented wave of protests that attracted world attention.

———

ANTI-LUKASHENKO PROTESTS “FROZEN”

Protests broke out after the Aug. 9 presidential election, the official results of which gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Opposition figures and some poll workers, however, said those results were fraudulent. The nationwide demonstrations, some of which attracted up to 200,000 people, were the largest and most sustained challenge to Lukashenko in his 26 years of repressive rule.

The protests withered away as severe cold set in and Belarusians became wearied by police repressions that were often violent. Some relatively small and scattered protests took place in late January and about 250 people were arrested.

Overall, human rights activists say, more than 30,000 people have been arrested in the monthslong wave of protests, and many of them were beaten. While opposition leaders chose peaceful tactics, police in Belarus intensified their repression and began to use water cannons, gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrations.

“The protests ceased to be an existential threat to Lukashenko’s power when it became clear that people were not ready for violent resistance,” said Artem Shraibman, an independent analyst from Minsk.

“Lukashenko opened a new portal to violence — we were shocked and not ready,"" said Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main challenger on the presidential ballot who fled to Lithuania under pressure just after the election.

At one point, as protesters demanding his resignation massed outside the presidential palace, Lukashenko strode the grounds carrying an automatic rifle. That moment ""exposed the tragedy of the situation — he is ready to shoot back, but not to leave,” Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press.

Barbed wire, water cannons, thousands of soldiers on the streets, and internet shutdowns have become common in Minsk over the past six months. Thousands of Belarusians were forced to flee the country.

But harsh actions by security forces have only temporarily muted the protests, Shraibman said.

“Lukashenko does not have a clear vision of a future strategy. He doesn’t know what to do with the majority of the urban population who have turned their backs on him,” he said.

———

LUKASHENKO PLAYS FOR TIME

A $1.5 billion loan from the Kremlin and a promise to send in Russian security forces if Lukashenko requests them helped Lukashenko maintain control over the security forces and officials.

In return, Lukashenko promised to reform the constitution and transfer a significant part of his powers to parliament and the government, and then leave. But these plans have been confused and contradictory.

At first, he said powers would be transferred to an All-Belarusian Assembly that is to convene in February. Then he disavowed these promises and announced amending the constitution by the end of 2021 and a new referendum. After the adoption of the new constitution, Lukashenko promised to hold a new presidential election.

“All statements are zigzag — the more he makes statements about the constitution, about the future state structure, the more we understand that there is no clear picture and he is just dragging his feet,"" said Shraibman.

During the period of mass protests, Lukashenko talked about “the decline of the presidential life” and possible resignation, but then he stopped such statements.

“Lukashenko is letting go of the so-called constitutional reform, which was mostly talked about by Russian leaders, since the protests have been suppressed and there is no longer any need for it,"" Shraibman said.

RUSSIA IN SEARCH OF AN ALTERNATIVE

Belarus and Russia are closely but awkwardly linked.

Moscow has supplied Minsk with cheap loans, oil and gas, keeping the unreformed Soviet-style economy of Belarus afloat. However, constant disputes over oil and gas prices have often led to public scandals and accusations by Lukashenko that Russia wants to absorb and incorporate Belarus. The Kremlin is uneasy with Lukashenko's volatility.

“Loud accusations and the scandalous character of Lukashenko are forcing the Kremlin to look for a replacement,” said Alexander Klaskovsky, an independent analyst. “But Putin cannot refuse to support Lukashenko without having a clear alternative and a clear scenario of his own.”

Lukashenko also has pressured Russia into cooperation by portraying Belarus as a testing ground for future uprisings in Russia.

""Now his tail is wagging the dog,” Klaskovsky said. “No matter how disagreeable Lukashenko may be to Putin, they will have to endure each other.”

———

WESTERN SANCTIONS

The EU has already introduced three packages of sanctions against seven Belarusian companies and 84 individuals, including Lukashenko.

“The sanctions create a lot of headaches, but they do not change the regime, they are rather symbolic,” Shraibman said.

In December, the United States adopted the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights and Sovereignty Act, which provides for sanctions not only against Belarusians, but also against Russian officials, companies and individuals for supporting Lukashenko's regime.

“The United States is using the mechanism of raising the price of Lukashenko for Putin, so that Minsk becomes an increasingly toxic and expensive partner for the Kremlin,” Shraibman said.

———

THE OPPOSITION'S LONG GAME

Peaceful protest and attempts to organize a nationwide strike failed. Officials and security personnel did not go over to the side of the opposition. Harsh repression and the imprisonment of opposition leaders has allowed authorities to take control of the situation.

But the opposition believes that Lukashenko has lost the support of the majority of Belarusians, and that this will eventually lead to changes within the country.

“Every day our resources are increasing, and the resources of the regime are dwindling. Every day he has less money, fewer people, fewer supporters inside and abroad, worse and worse reputation and, accordingly, fewer opportunities,"" said Tsikhanouskaya.

The opposition aims to resume its mass actions on March 25, the anniversary of the 1918 declaration of a short-lived independent Belarus. The day traditionally has seen large opposition demonstrations.

“We’re in the mood for long-term play,” Tsikhanouskaya said.","In winter's quiet, Belarus opposition prepares new protests"

TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran’s supreme leader on Sunday urged the United States to lift all sanctions if it wants Iran to live up to commitments under its nuclear deal with world powers, state TV reported, but President Joe Biden says the U.S. won't be making the first move.

“If (the U.S.) wants Iran to return to its commitments, it must lift all sanctions in practice, then we will do verification … then we will return to our commitments,” state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying, in his first comments on the matter since Biden took office.

Biden rejected the idea in a “CBS Evening News” interview taped Friday and airing Sunday.

He was asked if the US will lift sanctions first in order to get Iran back to the bargaining table.

“No,” Biden replied. He was then asked if Iran has to stop enriching uranium first. Biden nodded.

Former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from the atomic deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Biden has said he will seek to revive the deal, but insisted that Iran must first reverse its nuclear steps, creating a contest of wills between the nations.

“This is the definitive and irreversible policy of the Islamic Republic, and all of the country’s officials are unanimous on this, and no one will deviate from it,” Khamenei added Sunday, reiterating Iranian leaders' previous remarks that the U.S. must ease its sanctions before Iran comes back into compliance.

The supreme leader, 81, has the final say on all matters of state in Iran and approved the efforts at reaching the nuclear deal in 2015.

In response to Trump's so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, the country began to gradually violate its atomic commitments, and threatened further provocations in a bid to increase its leverage and get Biden to prioritize a return to the deal as he moves to dismantle Trump’s legacy. Biden has signed a series of executive actions that reverse course on a wide range of issues, including climate change and immigration.

Following the killing last December of an Iranian scientist credited with spearheading the country's disbanded military nuclear program, Iran's parliament approved a law to block international nuclear inspectors later this month — a serious violation of the accord.

Iran also has begun enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels and said it would experiment with uranium metals, a key component of a nuclear warhead. The country has announced its moves and insisted that all breaches of the pact are easily reversible. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.",Iran: US must lift sanctions before it lives up to nuke deal

Another snowstorm is set to hit the Northeast this weekend as the Midwest braces for dangerous wind chills. First, the snow is slamming the Midwest Saturday. Six inches of snow fell so far in parts of Nebraska.

The arctic air rushing across the Great Lakes is also triggering isolated heavy bands of lake effect snow. Over 1 foot of snow has been reported near Buffalo and in parts of western Michigan.

The lake effect snow can bring very heavy snow and gusty winds, leading to whiteout conditions at times.

By early Sunday morning, the snow will push into the Northeast, beginning in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore areas before reaching Philadelphia and New York City by mid-morning.

Bursts of heavy snow are expected with snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour possible.

Due to the storm, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday's vaccination appointments at the Stony Brook and Jones Beach state-run sites will be postponed.

Unlike Monday's major snowstorm, this storm will move quickly.

By the afternoon the snow will be focused on New England and by the evening the snow showers will be lingering along the New England coast.

The Interstate-95 corridor could see 3 to 6 inches of snow from Philadelphia through Boston.

Parts of Long Island and southeast New England could end up with over 6 inches.

Meanwhile, a blast of polar air is moving into the Midwest.

On Sunday morning, the wind chill -- what temperature it feels like -- will plunge to minus 28 degrees in Minneapolis, minus 26 degrees in Green Bay, minus 19 degrees in Chicago and minus 5 degrees in Detroit.

Reid is being investigated for ""impairment,"" Kansas City police said.

Reid suffered non-life-threatening injuries, but two children in a car involved in the crash were seriously injured, including one with life-threatening injuries.

The 35-year-old is a linebackers coach for the Chiefs, who played in the Super Bowl against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Head coach Andy Reid issued a statement in a postgame press conference Sunday night, saying, ""My heart goes out to all those that were involved in the accident – in particular the family with the little girl who is fighting for her life.""

""And listen, it’s a tough situation -- I can’t comment on it any more than what I am here -- so the questions that you have I’m gonna have to turn those down at this time,"" he continued. ""But just from a human standpoint, my heart bleeds for everybody involved in that.""

In the Chiefs' initial statement, the team said: ""The organization has been made aware of a multi-vehicle accident involving Outside Linebackers Coach, Britt Reid. We are in the process of gathering information, and we will have no further comment at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved.""

The accident took place Thursday night at about 9 p.m. near the Chiefs' practice facility at the Truman Sports Complex, according to police.

Reid hit a car that had run out of gas on the side of the road, causing a chain reaction that hit another car belonging to relatives assisting the stranded car, according to police. A 5-year-old in the second car suffered life-threatening injuries, while a 4-year-old in that car suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Both were transported to the hospital. The 5-year-old remained in critical condition on Saturday, police said.

The driver of the car Reid hit first and two adults in the second car were not injured.

According to a warrant obtained by ESPN, Reid admitted to being the driver of the Ram Laramie that caused the accident. An officer who arrived at the scene of the crash said he could smell a ""moderate odor"" of alcohol on Reid, and that his eyes were bloodshot. When asked if he had been drinking, Reid allegedly said he had two to three drinks and had also taken Adderall, according to the warrant.

After complaining of stomach pain, Reid was transported to a local hospital, where he was being observed for ""clues of impairment,"" according to the warrant.

The warrant also notes that Reid has ""multiple prior DUI contacts.""

The Chiefs had been in Kansas City due to COVID-19 protocols.

Reid did not travel to the Super Bowl, a source told ESPN's Dianna Russini, as he was still hospitalized. He could be hospitalized for days due to his injuries, the source added.

The Kansas City Police Department confirmed to ABC News that if there are charges in this case, they will not be filed until after the Super Bowl, because a normal investigation of this nature would take at least a few weeks.

Since 2013, Reid has worked alongside his father, who has coached in the NFL since 1992 and taken the Eagles and Chiefs to the Super Bowl. Andy Reid won his first title with Kansas City last year.

Britt Reid pleaded guilty to simple assault and flashing a gun at another driver in a road rage incident in 2007, according to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, court records, and served prison time. While in prison, he also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of a controlled substance from a separate incident, court records show.

He was twice given tickets for speeding while working for the Chiefs -- on Aug. 19, 2014 and Aug. 9, 2018 -- according to court records. He paid both fines.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Romoser believes it was a clear case of reinfection, rather than some mysterious reemergence of the original infection gone dormant. Because the coronavirus, like other viruses, regularly mutates as it multiplies and spreads through a community, a new infection would bear a different genetic fingerprint. But because neither lab had saved her testing samples for genetic sequencing, there was no way to confirm her suspicion.

“It would be nice to have proof,” said Romoser. “I’ve literally been straight up called a liar, because people don’t want to believe that it’s possible to be reinfected. Why would I lie about being sick?”

As millions of Americans struggle to recover from Covid-19 and millions more scramble for the protection offered by vaccines, U.S. health officials may be overlooking an unsettling subgroup of survivors: those who get infected more than once. Identifying how common reinfection is among people who contracted Covid-19 — as well as how quickly they become vulnerable and why — carries important implications for our understanding of immunity and the nation’s efforts to devise an effective vaccination program.

Scientists have confirmed that reinfections after initial illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus are possible, but so far have characterized them as rare. Fewer than 50 cases have been substantiated worldwide, according to a global reinfection tracker. Just five have been substantiated in the U.S., including two detected in California in late January.

That sounds like a rather insignificant number. But scientists’ understanding of reinfection has been constrained by the limited number of U.S. labs that retain Covid-19 testing samples or perform genetic sequencing. A KHN review of surveillance efforts finds that many U.S. states aren’t rigorously tracking or investigating suspected cases of reinfection.

I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection.

KHN sent queries about reinfection surveillance to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of 24 responses, fewer than half provided details about suspected or confirmed reinfection cases. Where officials said they’re actively monitoring for reinfection, they have found far more potential cases than previously anticipated.

In Washington state, for instance, health officials are investigating nearly 700 cases that meet the criteria for possible reinfection, with three dozen awaiting genetic sequencing and just one case confirmed.

In Colorado, officials estimate that possible reinfections make up just 0.1 percent of positive coronavirus cases. But with more than 396,000 cases reported, that means nearly 400 people may have been infected more than once.

In Minnesota, officials have investigated more than 150 cases of suspected reinfection, but they lack the genetic material to confirm a diagnosis, a spokesperson said.

In Nevada, where the first U.S. case of Covid-19 reinfection was identified last summer, Mark Pandori, director of the state public health lab, said there’s no doubt cases are going undetected.

“I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection,” he said. “They are very difficult to ascertain, so you need specialized teams to do that work, or a core lab.”

Such cases are different from instances of so-called long-haul Covid-19, in which the original infection triggers debilitating symptoms that linger for months and viral particles can continue to be detected. Reinfection occurs when a person is infected with Covid-19, clears that strain and is infected again with a different strain, raising concerns about sustained immunity from the disease. Such reinfections occur regularly with four other coronaviruses that circulate among humans, causing common colds.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for investigating for possible reinfection when someone tests positive for Covid-19 at least 90 days after an original infection (or at least 45 days for “highly suspicious” cases). Confirmation of reinfection requires genetic sequencing of paired samples from each episode to tell whether the genomes involved are different.

But the U.S. lacks the capacity for robust genetic sequencing, the process that identifies the fingerprint of a specific virus so it can be compared with other strains. Jeff Zients, head of the federal Covid task force, noted late last month that the U.S. ranks 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing.

To date, only a fraction of positive coronavirus samples has been sequenced, though the Biden administration is working to rapidly expand the effort. On Feb. 1, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters that sequencing has “increased tenfold” in recent weeks, from 251 sequences the week of Jan. 10 to 2,238 the week of Jan. 24. The agency is working with private companies, states and academic labs to ramp up to 6,000 sequences per week by mid-February.

Washington’s state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, Dr. Scott Lindquist, said officials have prioritized genetic sequencing at the state laboratory, with plans to begin genotyping 5 percent of all samples collected. That will allow officials to sort through those nearly 700 potential reinfections, Lindquist said. More important, the effort will also help signal the presence of significantly mutated forms of the coronavirus, known as variants, that could affect how easily the virus spreads and, perhaps, how sick Covid-19 makes people.

“Those two areas, reinfection and variants, may cross paths,” he said. “We wanted to be in front of it, not behind it.”

How long does immunity last?

The specter of reinfections complicates one of the central questions of the Covid-19 threat: How long after natural infection or vaccination will people remain immune?

Early studies suggested immunity would be short-lived, only a few months, while more recent research finds that certain antibodies and memory cells may persist in Covid-infected patients longer than eight months.

“We actually don’t know” the marker that would signal immunity, said Dr. Jason Goldman, an infectious diseases expert at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “We don’t have the test you could perform to say yes or no, you could be infected.”

Goldman and colleagues confirmed a case of reinfection in a Seattle man last fall, and since then have identified six or seven probable cases. “This is a much more common scenario than is being recognized,” he said.

The possibility of reinfection means that even patients who’ve had Covid-19 need to remain vigilant about curbing re-exposure, said Dr. Edgar Sanchez, an infectious diseases physician at Orlando Health in Florida.

“A lot of patients ask, ‘How long do I have to worry about getting Covid again?’” he said. “I literally tell them this: ‘You are probably safe for a few weeks, maybe even up to a couple of months, but beyond that, it’s really unclear.’”

The message is similar for the wider society, said Dr. Bill Messer, an expert in viral genetics at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who has been pondering the cultural psychology of the Covid-19 response. Evidence suggests there may not be a clear-cut return to normal.

“The idea that we will end this pandemic by beating this coronavirus, I don’t think that’s actually the way it’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that it’s more likely that we’re going to learn how to be comfortable living with this new virus circulating among us.”",Covid reinfections may be more common than realized.

Fewer than 50 cases have been substantiated worldwide, according to a global reinfection tracker. Just five have been substantiated in the U.S., including two detected in California in late January.

That sounds like a rather insignificant number. But scientists’ understanding of reinfection has been constrained by the limited number of U.S. labs that retain Covid-19 testing samples or perform genetic sequencing. A KHN review of surveillance efforts finds that many U.S. states aren’t rigorously tracking or investigating suspected cases of reinfection.

I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection.

KHN sent queries about reinfection surveillance to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of 24 responses, fewer than half provided details about suspected or confirmed reinfection cases. Where officials said they’re actively monitoring for reinfection, they have found far more potential cases than previously anticipated.

In Washington state, for instance, health officials are investigating nearly 700 cases that meet the criteria for possible reinfection, with three dozen awaiting genetic sequencing and just one case confirmed.

In Colorado, officials estimate that possible reinfections make up just 0.1 percent of positive coronavirus cases. But with more than 396,000 cases reported, that means nearly 400 people may have been infected more than once.

In Minnesota, officials have investigated more than 150 cases of suspected reinfection, but they lack the genetic material to confirm a diagnosis, a spokesperson said.

In Nevada, where the first U.S. case of Covid-19 reinfection was identified last summer, Mark Pandori, director of the state public health lab, said there’s no doubt cases are going undetected.

“I predict that we are missing cases of reinfection,” he said. “They are very difficult to ascertain, so you need specialized teams to do that work, or a core lab.”

Such cases are different from instances of so-called long-haul Covid-19, in which the original infection triggers debilitating symptoms that linger for months and viral particles can continue to be detected. Reinfection occurs when a person is infected with Covid-19, clears that strain and is infected again with a different strain, raising concerns about sustained immunity from the disease. Such reinfections occur regularly with four other coronaviruses that circulate among humans, causing common colds.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for investigating for possible reinfection when someone tests positive for Covid-19 at least 90 days after an original infection (or at least 45 days for “highly suspicious” cases). Confirmation of reinfection requires genetic sequencing of paired samples from each episode to tell whether the genomes involved are different.

But the U.S. lacks the capacity for robust genetic sequencing, the process that identifies the fingerprint of a specific virus so it can be compared with other strains. Jeff Zients, head of the federal Covid task force, noted late last month that the U.S. ranks 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing.

To date, only a fraction of positive coronavirus samples has been sequenced, though the Biden administration is working to rapidly expand the effort. On Feb. 1, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters that sequencing has “increased tenfold” in recent weeks, from 251 sequences the week of Jan. 10 to 2,238 the week of Jan. 24. The agency is working with private companies, states and academic labs to ramp up to 6,000 sequences per week by mid-February.

Washington’s state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, Dr. Scott Lindquist, said officials have prioritized genetic sequencing at the state laboratory, with plans to begin genotyping 5 percent of all samples collected. That will allow officials to sort through those nearly 700 potential reinfections, Lindquist said. More important, the effort will also help signal the presence of significantly mutated forms of the coronavirus, known as variants, that could affect how easily the virus spreads and, perhaps, how sick Covid-19 makes people.

“Those two areas, reinfection and variants, may cross paths,” he said. “We wanted to be in front of it, not behind it.”

How long does immunity last?

The specter of reinfections complicates one of the central questions of the Covid-19 threat: How long after natural infection or vaccination will people remain immune?

Early studies suggested immunity would be short-lived, only a few months, while more recent research finds that certain antibodies and memory cells may persist in Covid-infected patients longer than eight months.

“We actually don’t know” the marker that would signal immunity, said Dr. Jason Goldman, an infectious diseases expert at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “We don’t have the test you could perform to say yes or no, you could be infected.”

Goldman and colleagues confirmed a case of reinfection in a Seattle man last fall, and since then have identified six or seven probable cases. “This is a much more common scenario than is being recognized,” he said.

The possibility of reinfection means that even patients who’ve had Covid-19 need to remain vigilant about curbing re-exposure, said Dr. Edgar Sanchez, an infectious diseases physician at Orlando Health in Florida.

“A lot of patients ask, ‘How long do I have to worry about getting Covid again?’” he said. “I literally tell them this: ‘You are probably safe for a few weeks, maybe even up to a couple of months, but beyond that, it’s really unclear.’”

The message is similar for the wider society, said Dr. Bill Messer, an expert in viral genetics at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who has been pondering the cultural psychology of the Covid-19 response. Evidence suggests there may not be a clear-cut return to normal.

“The idea that we will end this pandemic by beating this coronavirus, I don’t think that’s actually the way it’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that it’s more likely that we’re going to learn how to be comfortable living with this new virus circulating among us.”",Covid reinfections may be more common than realized. Why isn't the U.S. tracking them?
"['David Ingram', 'David Ingram Covers Tech For Nbc News.']",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/states-may-need-pester-thousands-people-about-second-covid-19-n1256912,[],U.S. public health authorities have another challenge on their hands: making sure that people who’ve got their first shot return for their second one.,[''],en,2021-02-05 22:09:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com,,set(),"Nearly two months into the Covid-19 vaccination effort, U.S. public health authorities have another challenge on their hands: making sure that people who’ve got their first shot return for their second one.

Initial data shows that most people are coming back for their second shots. Data from the Texas Department of State Health Services showed just 0.3 percent of the 1.9 million people vaccinated thus far were late for their second shot — though another 7.5 percent are due.

In Oregon, 5 percent of people who received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination are late for their second shot, according to the state's public health data.

But researchers have reasons for concern. Vaccines for other types of illnesses may give a clue about the challenge facing public health authorities. For the anti-shingles vaccine Shingrix, about 25 percent of people who get the first dose don’t show up for their second dose, according to Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

“You should be hounded that you are due for your second dose,” he said.

It’s not a given that everyone will be diligent about completing the vaccination process on schedule, despite the scientific evidence that a booster shot makes the coronavirus vaccines more than 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness.

“The vast majority of people due for their second doses have gotten them, but there some who haven’t and are now past that six-week mark when it is recommended,” Chris Van Deusen, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email.

“We definitely want people to get their booster doses on time because they are important to boosting immunity,” he said.

And as more vaccines roll out beyond front-line health care workers and older Americans, there is some concern the number of people failing to get their second dose could grow. Offit said that states, counties and health care providers will need to rely on a combination of newer technology, such as smartphone notifications, along with older tactics such as phone calls to be sure to get people’s attention.

“God only knows that retail pharmacies are good at this. The minute your prescription comes in, you get the message and you get it again and again and again,” he said.

The push is taking place against the backdrop of a public debate around whether to delay the second shots and focus on getting the first shots to as many people as possible. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., sent a letter this week to Biden administration officials urging them to consider shifting to a one-dose strategy, an idea that many experts including Offit say is ill-conceived because that’s not how the Covid-19 vaccines were tested. Immunization is weaker and may not last as long with one dose, Offit said.

The guidance from the Biden administration and states is to complete the two-dose regimen.

A second dose is due around three weeks after the first dose for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and around four weeks for the Moderna vaccine, according to guidance published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC also said that the boosters could be given up to six weeks later if it were not feasible to get them sooner.

The first doses of the Pfizer vaccine were administered Dec. 14, meaning the recommended interval just recently ended for second shots for those patients.

There could be any number of reasons people haven’t received their second shots, experts said, and there’s no good evidence yet on the leading reasons. They could include limited supply, canceled appointments, fear of side-effects, forgetfulness or difficulty navigating appointment scheduling.

Politics may also be a factor. Offit said he was concerned that some state governors were quietly de-emphasizing the second doses. He said he had spoken with public health authorities who were feeling pressure to prioritize the first doses, at least in part because those numbers are often highlighted in the news media. He declined to identify the states.

“There is pressure to get as many people vaccinated as possible so that your state doesn’t look as worse as other states,” Offit said.

Not all states report data on how many people are overdue for their second doses, making it difficult for public health and medical experts to gauge the amount of catching up that states and health care providers have to do.

Florida reported the number of overdue doses in January, indicating tens of thousands of people were late at the time. But the label may not have been meaningful under eventual CDC guidance because that was before six weeks had passed since the first doses Dec. 14. In any case, Florida eventually stopped reporting the number.

Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida, said it was difficult to know yet whether states are struggling or how concerned to be. He said he was encouraged that, in recent days, Florida has been administering more second doses than first doses.

“It would take a little bit deeper investigation to know whether we should be worried about this,” he said. “I’m hoping that they’re at least collecting that information, analyzing it and following up.”

Florida’s state health department did not respond to a request for comment.

Vaccine experts are concerned that people may not realize that one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna shots won’t be enough to fully protect them against the virus. Offit specifically worries that getting only one dose of the mRNA vaccines, or waiting for many months between doses, might make it easier for the coronavirus to mutate.

“One dose might make it easier to create variants, because the virus is wounded with a lesser immune response, not killed,” he said via email. “And when wounded, it has a chance to escape.”",States may need to pester thousands of people about a second Covid-19 vaccine dose

Their focus: the tiny spike proteins that cover the outside of the virus.

It's those proteins that researchers have targeted to create vaccines, using them to prime the body's immune system to make antibodies to fight the virus. But it's also where they've observed some mutations that have forced vaccine manufacturers to react. A variant first found in South Africa is of particular interest because of mutations to the spike protein that can make antibodies less effective.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

And while none of those changes seem to have resulted in a virus that's able to evade the current vaccines, it's an area of intense focus for researchers.

""The spike protein is like the key that unlocks our cells,"" said Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading in England. ""If you have mutations on the spike protein, it could make that key work more effectively, or it could change the structure of the key ever so slightly so that it can still gain access to our cells, and now antibodies can't bind to it and stop it from working.""

An early analysis from Moderna found that while its vaccine appears to be less effective against the South African variant, antibodies remained above protective levels. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is only slightly less effective against the South African strain, according to a study that hasn't yet been peer-reviewed.

The coronavirus is likely to have undergone thousands of changes since it spilled over into humans. Several variants, including one that was first reported in the U.K. and another that is thought to have emerged in Brazil, are already being tracked worldwide.

But scientists remain anxious about the emergence of other coronavirus variants, especially if one renders the vaccines obsolete.

""Mutations can make a virus more transmissible or make a virus less susceptible to some antibodies, so that's always a big concern,"" Clarke said.

So far, the vaccines appear to protect against the known variants, said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. He said that even if a vaccine is less protective against one strain, there are still likely to be benefits, such as preventing more severe cases of Covid-19, which not only helps patients but also minimizes the strain on hospitals and health care workers.

""It's like how, even if a flu vaccine is 30 percent effective, we still recommend getting a flu shot,"" Lee said.

But that doesn't mean there aren't still risks — especially with the crucial role played by the virus's spike protein.

Both the South African variant and the U.K. variant contain a spike protein mutation called N501Y, which is thought to make them more contagious. The South African variant also carries a mutation known as E484K, also on the spike protein, which could make it less susceptible to antibodies produced by the vaccines or those built up from natural infection.

And because the vaccines target the spike protein, Lee said, there's a worry that mutations to that part of the virus could affect how well the vaccines work.

""If you change the spike protein enough, the question becomes: How will the immune response change?"" he said. ""The effectiveness of the vaccines really depends on our immune response to that spike protein.""

Research continues, but the observed declines in vaccine efficacy have already prompted Moderna to begin tweaking its vaccine to make it more effective against emerging strains. Even though Moderna's vaccine appears to protect against the known variants, the company's CEO, Stéphane Bancel, said last month that the upgrades are being developed ""out of an abundance of caution.""

AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which jointly developed a vaccine that is authorized for use in the U.K. but not yet in the U.S., announced Wednesday that they intend to produce an upgraded version to protect against the known variants, which could be available in the fall.

And scientists expect more variants to emerge as the virus evolves. Scientists in the U.K. reported Tuesday that the E484K mutation in the South African variant has also been found in a small number of cases involving the U.K. strain in England.

""The more a virus replicates, the more chances you have for random changes,"" Lee said. ""A lot of these changes won't make a difference, but every now and then, you'll get a change that gives the virus an advantage — making the virus better able to survive, replicate or infect people.""

The prospect adds urgency for countries to aggressively control the virus's spread, thereby limiting the opportunity for new, more problematic variants to circulate.

By her count, Makini-Anderson's nonprofit Inner City Youth Group has provided over 150,000 meals in the last 10 months.

""We have always been there since 2009, assisting the community,"" she said on a recent snowy morning after delivering breakfast to a local family. ""But since the pandemic, it's been an overload.""

For the vast majority of the families she helps feed, however, these meals are not the only support they rely on to keep afloat. Makini-Anderson estimates that 98 percent of the households she serves are already getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits — the government assistance program formerly known as food stamps. But the benefits provided by the nation's most important program for the hungry are simply not enough.

Experts and advocates say the pandemic has exposed a system that is outdated and inadequate.

Joseph Llobrera, director of research for the food assistance team at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank in Washington, said research shows SNAP isn't doing job No. 1: feeding the hungry. ""People run out of benefits two to three weeks into the month,"" he said.

Food relief organizations — from small church pantries and major regional food banks to organizations like Makini-Anderson's — have been shouldering a two-fold burden since the pandemic began: supporting the millions of Americans newly facing food insecurity, who don't participate in or don't qualify for SNAP, while also serving those already receiving assistance that doesn't get them through the month.

Before the pandemic, the average SNAP benefit was about $1.40 per person, per meal. During the pandemic, everyone on SNAP was bumped up to the maximum benefit of $2 per meal, but the families already at the maximum, those most in need, weren't given any additional funds.

Last month, the Biden administration challenged the Agriculture Department, which manages SNAP, to fix that but also to take an earlier-than-planned look at the basis for the benefit itself. Maximum benefit levels for SNAP are dictated by something called the ""Thrifty Food Plan,"" which is supposed to reflect the minimum cost of a nutritious diet.

But the Thrifty Food Plan hasn't been revised since 2006 and hasn't been dramatically reassessed since the 1970s, only increasing in line with inflation throughout the years. The plan wasn't due for reassessment for another two years.

""The Thrifty Food Plan is based on the assumption that people have a lot of time to price-shop and prepare meals from scratch, but the reality is that many families are juggling different jobs,"" Llobrera said. ""Building a food plan that assumes you're going to soak beans overnight rather than using canned beans — how realistic is that?"" Llobrera said the plan is also based on an outdated assumption that people spend the majority of their income on food, when in reality, most people now spend the biggest chunk of their paychecks on housing.

In the meantime, food banks have filled the gap.

""We've been at this for, what, 10, 11 months? And unfortunately, we have not seen a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Brian Barks, president and CEO of Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

When the pandemic began, NBC News reported that Barks' food bank had been so inundated by requests for assistance in applying for SNAP benefits that it had a backlog. Eventually, the food bank had to take down its advertisements about its SNAP assistance program because it was simply getting too many calls to handle.

""We would get such a huge call volume that with our limited staff, we just had no ability to keep up,"" Barks explained.

But the amount of food they had to purchase to keep up with the need went up, and up, and up. It went from $80,000 per month before the pandemic to a staggering $1.5 million that the food bank now spends each month to feed the pantries — and the people — that rely on them.

""There are some serious questions that Americans are asking themselves every day. 'Do I get the medicine that I need or do I buy food? Do I pay the electric bill or do I buy food?' The people who are in that gap that don't qualify for SNAP benefits, and those who do and still need food assistance, that's a big gap,"" he said.

Barks' food bank is not unique in this regard. Across the country at Feeding San Diego, which serves San Diego County and surrounding areas, 700,000 more meals are being distributed every month compared to the same time last year.

Barks said the changes to SNAP announced by the Biden administration last month have him feeling hopeful.

""SNAP is a political football. It always has been,"" he said, ""But it is a key, essential tool that every food bank needs in order to do the work that we do. We need help from the federal government, the state and local governments, to do this work. People who are waiting for food banks to solve the food insecurity problem in our country, we're not going to do it.""

In fact, the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks, of which both Food Bank for the Heartland and Feeding San Diego are members, conducted a study showing that for every meal provided by one of their food banks, SNAP can provide nine.

That's concerning for people like Makini-Anderson in Detroit, who often see struggling families that don't qualify for the boost that SNAP benefits provide.

Families like Barry Chambliss and Melissa Michaux's: With five kids under age 10 and dramatic losses to their income during the pandemic, Chambliss and Michaux have been scraping by. But when they applied for SNAP in the spring, they were denied.

""On the last denial that I've gotten, it said that I need to turn in verifications of end of employment for jobs that Barry hasn't had in years,"" Michaux said.

Efforts to challenge that decision and get in touch with a case worker led to unanswered phone calls and frustration, the couple said.

""People used to be able to go inside the office and actually complete the actual application, and they can have assistance with that,"" Makini-Anderson noted. Now ""it's hard for them to even navigate through their phone to complete this application.""

It's something Stacy Dean, the new deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the Agriculture Department, is acutely aware of.

""This is what in my new job is keeping me up at night, is who are we missing?"" Dean said. ""The process of applying for SNAP benefits is tough. It's incredibly rigorous. And trying to carry that out in a remote environment has made it, I think, a little bit more difficult both for the states who are running the program and the people who need the benefits.""

The cost of administering SNAP is split between states and the federal government, but as 6 million more people in America were added to the SNAP rolls last year, many states were essentially being asked to do more with the same or fewer resources and to do it all remotely.

""One of the things we want to do is ease up on some of the rules to make it easier for states to run the program,"" Dean said.

She acknowledged that food banks have stepped up. ""They can meet an emergency need very quickly,"" Dean said. ""Unfortunately, in this environment, they have been asked to do so much more, which is to provide food for longer periods of time and to supplement the federal food programs.""

For those who help meet the need, that's foreboding. After the Great Recession in 2008, it took a decade for food insecurity to fall back to previous levels.

""It is taking every ounce of energy that we have in order to try to help those people who have been added to the rolls of those who are now food insecure,"" Barks said. ""Anything, anything that can be done to alleviate the pressure that food banks are facing, to purchase and distribute food will benefit the hunger relief organizations in a positive way.""

Back in Detroit, things are looking up for Chambliss and Michaux. When reached for comment, a spokesperson from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the agency couldn't comment on the particulars of Chambliss and Michaux's case due to confidentiality requirements. But since a ""Nightly News"" story aired this month focusing on the couple and their children, Makini-Anderson said the agency has reached out to the family offering to provide help.

In fact, the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks, of which both Food Bank for the Heartland and Feeding San Diego are members, conducted a study showing that for every meal provided by one of their food banks, SNAP can provide nine.

That's concerning for people like Makini-Anderson in Detroit, who often see struggling families that don't qualify for the boost that SNAP benefits provide.

Families like Barry Chambliss and Melissa Michaux's: With five kids under age 10 and dramatic losses to their income during the pandemic, Chambliss and Michaux have been scraping by. But when they applied for SNAP in the spring, they were denied.

""On the last denial that I've gotten, it said that I need to turn in verifications of end of employment for jobs that Barry hasn't had in years,"" Michaux said.

Efforts to challenge that decision and get in touch with a case worker led to unanswered phone calls and frustration, the couple said.

""People used to be able to go inside the office and actually complete the actual application, and they can have assistance with that,"" Makini-Anderson noted. Now ""it's hard for them to even navigate through their phone to complete this application.""

It's something Stacy Dean, the new deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the Agriculture Department, is acutely aware of.

""This is what in my new job is keeping me up at night, is who are we missing?"" Dean said. ""The process of applying for SNAP benefits is tough. It's incredibly rigorous. And trying to carry that out in a remote environment has made it, I think, a little bit more difficult both for the states who are running the program and the people who need the benefits.""

The cost of administering SNAP is split between states and the federal government, but as 6 million more people in America were added to the SNAP rolls last year, many states were essentially being asked to do more with the same or fewer resources and to do it all remotely.

""One of the things we want to do is ease up on some of the rules to make it easier for states to run the program,"" Dean said.

She acknowledged that food banks have stepped up. ""They can meet an emergency need very quickly,"" Dean said. ""Unfortunately, in this environment, they have been asked to do so much more, which is to provide food for longer periods of time and to supplement the federal food programs.""

For those who help meet the need, that's foreboding. After the Great Recession in 2008, it took a decade for food insecurity to fall back to previous levels.

""It is taking every ounce of energy that we have in order to try to help those people who have been added to the rolls of those who are now food insecure,"" Barks said. ""Anything, anything that can be done to alleviate the pressure that food banks are facing, to purchase and distribute food will benefit the hunger relief organizations in a positive way.""

Back in Detroit, things are looking up for Chambliss and Michaux. When reached for comment, a spokesperson from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the agency couldn't comment on the particulars of Chambliss and Michaux's case due to confidentiality requirements. But since a ""Nightly News"" story aired this month focusing on the couple and their children, Makini-Anderson said the agency has reached out to the family offering to provide help.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., decried the push to lower the income threshold to be eligible for stimulus checks in the latest Covid-19 relief package Sunday, calling it ""absurd"" and senseless.

""Well, I think what we have done in the past and what we have promised the American people, we have said two things in the last month,"" Sanders, chairman of the Budget Committee, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We said we're going to get you $2,000. And that's $600 plus $1,400. And what we're going to do is say that everybody, a single person, individual $75,000 or lower, and a couple of $150,000 or lower, will be eligible for that full $2,000, $600 plus $1,400.

""Now, when people said, 'We don't want rich people to get that benefit,' I understand that. I agree,"" Sanders continued. ""But to say to a worker in Vermont or California or any place else that, if you're making $52,000 a year, you are too rich to get this help, the full benefit, I think that that's absurd.""

Senate Democrats are split over who should be eligible for a new round of checks as they seek to pass a new stimulus package. The last round of checks was cut off for people making more than $99,000 or couples who made above $198,000. In his initial proposal, Biden recommended the same threshold.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., last week offered a nonbinding amendment backed by some other Democrats to ""ensure upper-income taxpayers are not eligible"" for the checks. Manchin wants to phase out the stimulus checks beginning at $50,000 per person or $100,000 per couple, rather than at $75,000 and $150,000.

Biden also opened the door to adjusting the income levels Wednesday in a call with Democrats.

Speaking on ""State of the Union,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Biden thinks it's appropriate for those making more than $50,000 to get the full benefit. She didn't say whether sentiment extends up to $75,000.

""Well, President Biden is certainly willing to work with members of Congress to define what's fair,"" she said. ""And he wouldn't want to see a household making over $300,000 receive these payments. But if you think about an elementary school teacher or a policeman making $60,000 a year and faced with children who are out of school and people who may have had to withdraw from the labor force in order to take care of them and many extra burdens, I would — he thinks, and I would certainly agree — that it's appropriate for people there to get support.""

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg pressed for immediate action when asked whether it's worth it to lower the threshold if it means passing the bill sooner.

""Look, there's an active conversation going on right now, obviously, but the bottom line is we've got to support as many Americans as we can as robustly as we can and as quickly as we can,"" he said. ""Time is of the essence.""",Sanders says it's 'absurd' to lower income threshold for stimulus checks

From the time Brady, husband of supermodel Gisele Bündchen, set foot in Florida, he made winning fashionable again in Tampa. He completed passes for 4,633 yards, third most in the NFL, during an 11-5 regular season.

It's a battle of the ages.,[''],en,2021-02-06 09:30:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com,,set(),"There are a lot of numbers that define the matchup between the quarterbacks in Sunday’s Super Bowl — touchdowns, yards and passes, to name a few. But perhaps no difference is more revealing than this figure: Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is 43, while Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs is 25.

Their teams (and their fans) look to them for leadership. Yet the leadership strengths Brady has are entirely different from the ones brought by Mahomes.

It’s the largest age gap between opposing quarterbacks in Super Bowl history. Mahomes is a millennial — and just barely, as he’s only about a year shy of Gen Z — in his fourth year with the NFL. He’s going toe-to-toe against Brady, a Gen Xer with six Super Bowl wins to his name. This confrontation is being seen as a classic battle between young and old, but comparing Mahomes and Brady this way fails to grasp a fundamental truth: Every generation, and age, brings with it a unique perspective and strength. This is why we can be equally in awe of a 43-year-old veteran and a quarterback trying to win his second Super Bowl by age 25.

Case in point: Both Mahomes and Brady are phenoms. Their teams (and their fans) look to them for leadership. Yet the leadership strengths Brady has are entirely different from the ones Mahomes brings. So which type of leadership is best? And more to the point, which is more likely to result in victory on Sunday?

There’s not a one-size-fits-all answer. We expect — and often need — different things from our leaders depending on the challenges we face. And those differing qualities mean we can’t simply look at the raw athletic ability of a youthful quarterback and know how that will stack up against the wisdom of a middle-aged QB as they battle it out on the biggest stage in the NFL. (And that’s before getting to external factors such as the relative strength of their offensive lines.)

We traditionally look to more mature leaders when we need stability, according to research in Leadership Quarterly. They have learned valuable lessons that they can share with their teams to steady the boat during a challenge or crisis, and the networks they have built can provide additional support, particularly for those with less experience.

Brady, as the oldest quarterback in the NFL, is a textbook example. When he was preparing to leave New England for Tampa Bay, NBC Sports Boston wrote, “He will go down as one of the greatest players in NFL history. He'll also go down as one of the most consistent.”

There’s also simply the raw accumulation of knowledge and muscle memory. “When you open up Tom Brady’s brain — 20 years of football comes pouring out,” NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger once said. “He can call any play from any era to fix an issue or make a first down or win a game. You can’t expect [younger players] to understand his 20 years of experience.”

Indeed, that particular kind of wisdom can only be demanded from a seasoned pro like Brady. His years on the field have honed his ability to think strategically and allowed him to form strong relationships. He’s even on good terms with NFL refs (a rapport termed the “stuff of legend”).

His time on the field has also given him a seasoned mental toughness. Brady states in his book, “When you’re in a Super Bowl game and your team is three touchdowns down and the clock is running, mental toughness is what makes the difference at the end.” He would know: This will be his 10th Super Bowl, more than any other player.

While he’s taken home Super Bowl MVP four times, experience has also taught him the importance of investing in his team. Older leaders who have already established a strong reputation for themselves are often more willing to empower younger members. Brady is known for this kind of approach, which I’ve termed “Gentelligence,” or the ability to view generational diversity in an organization as an opportunity for growth and success rather than a threat.

Mahomes, on the other hand, is headed back to the Super Bowl at age 25 with one win as QB already under his belt. So how is it that, 18 years younger than Brady with nowhere near his level of experience, Mahomes is an extraordinary leader in his own right? When we look at it through the lens of Gentelligence, we realize his youth allows him to bring a completely different kind of value and strength to the field.

If we want to make a splash or mix things up, we seek out someone younger to lead the way. Research shows younger people are expected to have more energy and are more willing to take risks, meaning followers have historically looked to them if the challenge was about exploration or ways to invent something new.

Indeed, inventing something new seems to be a Mahomes hallmark. He’s beendescribed by other players as fearless, creative and crafty. After the Chiefs’ matchup with the New Orleans Saints in December, Insider reported, “Patrick Mahomes continues to find new ways to beat opposing defenses. As the most creative passer in the NFL, we've seen Mahomes make every sort of throw, from a left-handed shovel to a bit of no-look flair to a toe-dragging touchdown in a must-win game.”

Mahomes continues to earn his innovator reputation every time he takes the field. Under his leadership, we’ve seen the Smoked Sausage, Black Pearl and Ferrari Right — all wild and unexpected plays that represent a spirit of fun as well as experimentation. “I've never seen anything like it,” Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins has said. “We got one of the best quarterbacks in the league, so whatever he says, we're going to kind of follow it. He's so creative to where everybody is like, ‘Let’s give it a try.'”

Because younger leaders are often expected to shake things up, they have more of an opportunity to champion needed change within their organizations. But to ensure those new ways of doing things get traction, it’s important they partner with older team members to get buy-in. The key to the success of younger leaders is balancing that innovation with humility — since they can get pushback if they don’t appreciate the way things have traditionally been done.

On Super Bowl Sunday, Brady and Mahomes will be pulling from different playbooks, but effective leadership doesn’t belong to just one generation or age.

Mahomes seems to have mastered that balance. His teammates say he is known for his humility even as he has achieved celebrity status. According to Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu, “I don’t think he understands who he is and maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe he’s really grounded and really humble in who he is as a person.”

On Super Bowl Sunday, Brady and Mahomes will be pulling from different playbooks, but effective leadership doesn’t belong to just one generation or age. Leadership is about mobilizing your team to do extraordinary things, and that kind of impact comes from leaning into your unique strengths, whether that be decades of experience or a youthful willingness to make unexpected moves.","Super Bowl pits Brady against Mahomes, Bucs against Chiefs and Gen X against millennials"

As always, part of the spectacle has nothing to do with football: The Weeknd will be performing at halftime, and a slate of celebrity commercials are already racking up views on YouTube.

One of the higher-profile ads is a “reimagining” of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” commissioned by website builder Squarespace. Sadly, this tone-deaf misstep from the beloved icon may be the biggest upset of the day.

Dolly Parton herself is no stranger to good press. To say that the country music legend is beloved is a massive understatement.

Dolly Parton herself is no stranger to good press. To say that the country music legend is beloved is a massive understatement; the woman has been up to her ears in goodwill since she burst onto the country music scene in 1967 with her tongue-in-cheek chart-topper “Dumb Blonde.” Despite her penchant for self-deprecation and healthy sense of fun, Parton is also a shark in the boardroom. She outfoxed the hapless Nashville, Tennessee, power brokers who once tried to control her career and has since built herself an empire.

Her reputation as a savvy businesswoman is well earned, but so is her legacy as a philanthropist. There’s a reason Parton is not only respected, but genuinely adored, and her big heart is a major factor. Just this month, we’ve read about how Parton refused to use her position to skip the line for a Covid-19 vaccination (after she donated $1 million toward its development) and how she turned down a Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Donald Trump — twice. (The latter move thrilled many fans who read it as a sign of the famously cagey star’s true political leanings, but it ultimately proved to be more about scheduling than her personal politics.)

This is Parton’s very first Super Bowl ad, featuring her reworked classic anthem “9 to 5.” Fans were initially excited to see what the reigning Queen of Country Music had cooked up, but it quickly became apparent that Parton had made a rare miscalculation.

Rather than paying homage to the spirit of the original song, which made no bones about the exploitative nature of the daily grind, the commercial for Squarespace features a tinny ode to the side hustle. Its office workers are portrayed as being overjoyed to continue working after hours, their side hustles are painted as freeing, fun and fulfilling, and the song itself encourages them to ""be your own boss, climb your own ladder.""

It’s a perfect storm of gig economy propaganda. And it’s a particularly disappointing message to hear from someone like Parton, who once warned us, “You're just a step on the boss man's ladder,” and made her cinematic debut as a secretary who gets so tired of her boss’s sexual harassment that she almost shoots him.

That cinematic debut — in 1980’s “9 to 5” — helped make Parton an even bigger star, while also highlighting the kind of drudgery, disrespect and degradation that so many workers, especially women, face on the job. (The song was written specifically for the film’s opening credits.) It echoed the goals of the real-life and still-active 9to5 movement, which fought for better pay, better working conditions and an end to sexual harassment at work, issues that still plague millions of workers today. In an inadvertent hat tip to the anarchists of Chicago who called for “eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will!” back in the 19th century, the “9 to 5” theme song warned that working eight hours a day in a dead-end job was already no way to make a living (“Barely gettin' by/ It's all takin' and no givin'”) with the implication that even this was already too much to ask.

Now, Parton’s silvery voice is being used to promote the false virtues of working overtime, when so many gig economy workers are barely scraping by and the tech companies who employ — but misclassify — them are raking in boffo profits. The gig economy is a wretched alternative to a stable paycheck and proper benefits, and efforts to paint it as a matter of “independence” or “being one’s own boss” downplay how hard it is for so many gig workers to make ends meet. The lack of a safety net has become even more apparent thanks to the increased demands and dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic Parton herself has helped combat; delivery drivers, grocery shoppers and other gig workers have become a lifeline to so many, and yet they remain stripped of the protections and dignity they deserve.

Now, Parton’s silvery voice is being used to promote the false virtues of working overtime, when so many gig economy workers are barely scraping by.

As author Sarah Smarsh notes in her new book, “She Come by It Natural: Dolly Parton and the Women Who Lived Her Songs,” Parton has long been a voice for poor and working-class women, and her kitchen-table approach to feminism has resonated with generations of women who couldn’t afford to take off work for a protest, but nevertheless knew how to fight for what they deserved.

Knowing this context, it’s so disappointing to read the lyrics to this new song and hear her literally sing the praises of “working, working, working.” It’s not “fun” or “empowering” to juggle multiple jobs; it’s an indictment of a system in which people aren’t paid fairly and workers are squeezed down to the last drop of energy.

That all raises the question: Why did she do it? Parton’s every public move is so calculated, and she is so protective of her image and her legacy, that it really is jarring to see her disappoint so many fans in one fell swoop. It will do little to tarnish her glittering legacy, but it still hurts. As music critic Hilary Hughes explained for Slate, “The commercial will air and the world will move on, but the fact remains that Parton—an artist deservedly lauded as one of the most skillful, altruistic, and generous performers of all time—diminished one of the most potent, and beloved, messages behind her own work while dressing it up as a tribute.”

One imagines that the Squarespace executives who pitched the idea to her played up the “empowerment” angle, maybe framing it as a means to encourage more creativity and experimentation. The press release chirps that the song is intended “to celebrate a new generation of entrepreneurs, and empower anyone with a dream to get started,” which seemingly falls neatly in line with Parton’s own rags-to-riches story. I’d bet my bottom dollar that the true horrors of the gig economy and of America’s broken economic system never came up.

And as much as we all love Parton, she’s still a capitalist and still a very, very rich woman; she has a vested interest in boosting her public profile, and Squarespace surely paid dearly for the privilege of borrowing some of her sparkle. Parton doesn’t need the money herself, but between funding her philanthropic efforts, supporting her family and local community and expanding her empire, I can see her welcoming an influx of filthy lucre. The reality is that it made good business sense, and she's always been a shrewd businesswoman.

As Dolly Parton herself once said, “It’s a rich man’s game,” and it looks like she’s still in it to win it.

As always, part of the spectacle has nothing to do with football: The Weeknd will be performing at halftime, and a slate of celebrity commercials are already racking up views on YouTube.

One of the higher-profile ads is a “reimagining” of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” commissioned by website builder Squarespace. Sadly, this tone-deaf misstep from the beloved icon may be the biggest upset of the day.

Dolly Parton herself is no stranger to good press. To say that the country music legend is beloved is a massive understatement.

Dolly Parton herself is no stranger to good press. To say that the country music legend is beloved is a massive understatement; the woman has been up to her ears in goodwill since she burst onto the country music scene in 1967 with her tongue-in-cheek chart-topper “Dumb Blonde.” Despite her penchant for self-deprecation and healthy sense of fun, Parton is also a shark in the boardroom. She outfoxed the hapless Nashville, Tennessee, power brokers who once tried to control her career and has since built herself an empire.

Her reputation as a savvy businesswoman is well earned, but so is her legacy as a philanthropist. There’s a reason Parton is not only respected, but genuinely adored, and her big heart is a major factor. Just this month, we’ve read about how Parton refused to use her position to skip the line for a Covid-19 vaccination (after she donated $1 million toward its development) and how she turned down a Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Donald Trump — twice. (The latter move thrilled many fans who read it as a sign of the famously cagey star’s true political leanings, but it ultimately proved to be more about scheduling than her personal politics.)

This is Parton’s very first Super Bowl ad, featuring her reworked classic anthem “9 to 5.” Fans were initially excited to see what the reigning Queen of Country Music had cooked up, but it quickly became apparent that Parton had made a rare miscalculation.

Rather than paying homage to the spirit of the original song, which made no bones about the exploitative nature of the daily grind, the commercial for Squarespace features a tinny ode to the side hustle. Its office workers are portrayed as being overjoyed to continue working after hours, their side hustles are painted as freeing, fun and fulfilling, and the song itself encourages them to ""be your own boss, climb your own ladder.""

It’s a perfect storm of gig economy propaganda. And it’s a particularly disappointing message to hear from someone like Parton, who once warned us, “You're just a step on the boss man's ladder,” and made her cinematic debut as a secretary who gets so tired of her boss’s sexual harassment that she almost shoots him.

That cinematic debut — in 1980’s “9 to 5” — helped make Parton an even bigger star, while also highlighting the kind of drudgery, disrespect and degradation that so many workers, especially women, face on the job. (The song was written specifically for the film’s opening credits.) It echoed the goals of the real-life and still-active 9to5 movement, which fought for better pay, better working conditions and an end to sexual harassment at work, issues that still plague millions of workers today. In an inadvertent hat tip to the anarchists of Chicago who called for “eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will!” back in the 19th century, the “9 to 5” theme song warned that working eight hours a day in a dead-end job was already no way to make a living (“Barely gettin' by/ It's all takin' and no givin'”) with the implication that even this was already too much to ask.

Now, Parton’s silvery voice is being used to promote the false virtues of working overtime, when so many gig economy workers are barely scraping by and the tech companies who employ — but misclassify — them are raking in boffo profits. The gig economy is a wretched alternative to a stable paycheck and proper benefits, and efforts to paint it as a matter of “independence” or “being one’s own boss” downplay how hard it is for so many gig workers to make ends meet. The lack of a safety net has become even more apparent thanks to the increased demands and dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic Parton herself has helped combat; delivery drivers, grocery shoppers and other gig workers have become a lifeline to so many, and yet they remain stripped of the protections and dignity they deserve.

Now, Parton’s silvery voice is being used to promote the false virtues of working overtime, when so many gig economy workers are barely scraping by.

As author Sarah Smarsh notes in her new book, “She Come by It Natural: Dolly Parton and the Women Who Lived Her Songs,” Parton has long been a voice for poor and working-class women, and her kitchen-table approach to feminism has resonated with generations of women who couldn’t afford to take off work for a protest, but nevertheless knew how to fight for what they deserved.

Knowing this context, it’s so disappointing to read the lyrics to this new song and hear her literally sing the praises of “working, working, working.” It’s not “fun” or “empowering” to juggle multiple jobs; it’s an indictment of a system in which people aren’t paid fairly and workers are squeezed down to the last drop of energy.

That all raises the question: Why did she do it? Parton’s every public move is so calculated, and she is so protective of her image and her legacy, that it really is jarring to see her disappoint so many fans in one fell swoop. It will do little to tarnish her glittering legacy, but it still hurts. As music critic Hilary Hughes explained for Slate, “The commercial will air and the world will move on, but the fact remains that Parton—an artist deservedly lauded as one of the most skillful, altruistic, and generous performers of all time—diminished one of the most potent, and beloved, messages behind her own work while dressing it up as a tribute.”

They will eventually drop their name.

They will be forced to do away with the dehumanization and commodification of Native Americans that are their name and logo and beloved team traditions. It will happen.

They’re just being stubborn right now and refusing to simply ride the massive wave of change occurring at this moment in this country.

We’ve already seen this story play out; so have they. They’ve simply chosen the more difficult path.

There was, after all, once another professional football team with a racist, nasty name — this one, defined by the dictionary as a slur against Indigenous peoples. The team hails from Washington, D.C., and its fantastically obstinate owner once told USA Today Sports during an interview that he would “NEVER” change the name. He even instructed the reporter to use all caps.

It doesn’t take a long lens to see that the Chiefs — and the NFL — are not facing this issue head-on.

Well, that didn’t last. That same organization — currently temporarily calling itself the Washington Football Team — announced in July that it was, finally, changing the name. No apology was ever issued by that once immovable owner, but he changed the name all the same.

Five months after that announcement, the Cleveland Indians — who for years dug their cleats into the Kentucky bluegrass over both their name and their mascot — finally said they, too, are done with their team name and the associated racist caricature mascot, Chief Wahoo.

“We believe our organization is at its best when we can unify our community and bring people together — and we believe a new name will allow us to do this more fully,” the team said in a statement.

But it would appear the Kansas City Chiefs do not (yet) share that sentiment. They think simply banning headdresses and face paint “styled in a way that references or appropriates American Indian cultures and traditions” from their stadium is enough.

The Chiefs will be forced to do away with the dehumanization and commodification of Native Americans.

But while their fans are not allowed to appropriate our cultures and traditions (during home games), the team itself still can — with that stupid, massive drum that celebrities and VIPs (like actor Paul Rudd) bang before home games, its arrowhead logo and even the name of stadium, Arrowhead Stadium.

And what about other stadiums? As it currently stands, a fanatical Chiefs fan could travel to any other NFL stadium and don a headdress, wear faux war paint, wrap himself in a loincloth and tomahawk chop all the way to his seat if he wanted to.

It doesn’t take a long lens to see that the Chiefs — and the NFL — are not facing this issue head-on. They just want you to think they are. Their actions are little more than public relations stunts — a bandage on a gaping wound.

Indeed, the Chiefs are responding to social pressure, not social science in making their decision: It was more than 15 years ago that the American Psychological Association called for the immediate abolishment of all American Indian mascots everywhere because there is empirical evidence that proves these images and language harm the mental health and stability of kids, Native and non-Native alike.

Racism is always ugly, but it seems to get even uglier when it’s welcomed on a national stage like the Super Bowl.

No matter what Native American mascot and team name apologist may say on the matter, asking for their removal isn’t a political correctness issue. This has been and will continue to be an issue of protecting the well-being of our kids, yours and mine.

That’s why, all over the country, local schools, small cities and even big businesses are abandoning their Native American mascots. Land O’Lakes dropped its ""Indian maiden"" from its logo, the insurance company Mutual of Omaha ditched its bulbous “Indian head” bust and Leinenkugel's, the beer company, retired its image of a Native woman with a single feather in her hair late last July.

Still, the Chiefs are not alone in their dogged inflexibility: The NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks have thus far refused to change their name and logo.

Naturally, a protest against Native mascots is slated to be held outside the Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida — and there is no doubt that protesters will be met with war whoops and vitriol like, “Get a job,” and, “Go back to the reservation,” because that’s how it goes. Anti-Native sentiment remains one of the last holdouts of blatant American racism, excused and welcomed by wild sports heads of all colors and creeds.

Racism is always ugly, but it seems to get even uglier when it’s welcomed on a national stage like the Super Bowl. How much longer do we Natives have to be subjected to this shame? When we look back on this brutal epoch, both teams and their intransigence will stand as a monument to pigheadedness and denial during a time of growing racial justice in the U.S.

It was around noon, just before a mob of far-right rioters, including white supremacists and anti-government militia members, broke away from the rally and stormed the U.S. Capitol. Even then, the court officials on the call expressed concern about a local law enforcement officer attending an event supporting Trump’s false claim that the election had been stolen. “You and other defense attorneys are going to have a field day with him,” Goodrich recalled one of the officials telling him.

The detective, a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy named Jeff Farmer, did not join those who attacked the Capitol and has not been charged with a crime. But his participation in Trump’s rally put fresh focus on his work in Franklin County, where Goodrich and his co-workers say Farmer was known for his zealous pursuit of drug offenders.

Farmer, who is white, was popular among law enforcement and residents who’d sought his help with drug activity in their neighborhoods. But Goodrich and a local civil rights group knew his name because some of those Farmer arrested in recent years, including about half a dozen clients of the public defender’s office, claimed in court filings that he had improperly searched them, used excessive force or targeted them because they were Black.

The civil rights group, Focus on Race Relations: Frankfort, had shared Black residents’ concerns about Farmer with Sheriff Chris Quire last summer. Little had come of it: Many of the complaints were informal, and of the allegations that were raised in court, most had been dismissed by judges or abandoned when defendants agreed to plea deals.

But that changed Jan. 6, with Farmer suddenly in the spotlight. A public outcry led Quire to launch an investigation into Farmer’s participation in the rally and the previous complaints against him, which prompted a furious response from the deputy’s supporters. The debate has split a community already divided over Trump, the election results and the public’s trust in law enforcement.

The sheriff’s office has been barraged with messages — both complaints about Farmer and praise for him.

“Half of the county is against him, half of the county is for him,” said Capt. Daniel Wills, a spokesman for the department, who defended Farmer’s work ethic and said he has “done a tremendous job.”

Farmer declined to comment.

The conflict in Franklin County has been repeated across the country over the past month, as communities learn that local police officers traveled to Washington for the Trump demonstration. Some, including officers from Houston and Rocky Mount, Virginia, were accused of joining the Capitol riot and now face criminal charges.

But more than two dozen other police officers have said they attended the rally but did not join in the violence that followed. In addition to Farmer, the list includes a Kentucky state trooper, a police chief in New Hampshire, five Seattle officers and seven members of Philadelphia’s public transit police agency. Officers and their supporters say they were exercising their First Amendment rights.

While the officers have not been accused of breaking any laws, several agencies have launched internal investigations into possible violations of their codes of conduct. They also want to understand what drew the officers to the rally, which was timed to coincide with Congress’ certifying the election results and followed weeks of online mobilizing by extremist groups calling for an occupation of the Capitol.

“The march was based on a lie — ’stop the steal,’ the election was stolen,” Goodrich said. “So much of Deputy Farmer’s work as a detective is determining when people are telling the truth and lying to him. It raises questions about his ability to do his job as a detective when he’s engaged in a rally in support of a belief that so many members of the community believe is utterly without support.”

A trip to the rally

There was nothing secret about Farmer’s participation in the Jan. 6 rally. He documented his arrival with friends on Facebook, and after the siege wrote a post in which he called the rioters “idiots” and questioned whether they were really Trump supporters. (Farmer’s Facebook page has been deleted, but screenshots of the post were provided to NBC News by people who were friends with him on the site.)

The next day, on the drive back to Kentucky, Farmer got on a video call with a reporter from the local NBC affiliate in Lexington. Wearing a hoodie with a Fraternal Order of Police logo, Farmer said he’d gone to Washington to celebrate Trump’s four years in office.

In the courthouse and in neighborhoods with high drug traffic, Farmer is a familiar presence, welcomed by some and feared by others. People who have called the sheriff’s office to report drug activity and got a response from Farmer say he is relentless in his pursuit of the bottom- and mid-rung players in the local narcotics economy. Some of those who become his target say he often goes too far, using questionable reasons to stop, search and charge them — although the sheriff’s office says it has no record of formal complaints lodged against Farmer. His world is a tiny slice of America’s never-ending war on drugs.

Franklin County is the home of Frankfort, the state capital, and Kentucky State University, a historically Black institution; residents say it has a small-town feel. About 50,000 people live in the county, 82 percent of them white and about 9 percent Black. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2-to-1 — an anomaly in deeply red Kentucky — but Trump carried the county in November by 248 votes.

Because Frankfort is the seat of state power, it was the site of a number of emotionally charged protests in 2020, from Black Lives Matter marches in response to the killing of Breonna Taylor in a botched police raid in Louisville to conservative demonstrations against coronavirus lockdown orders. Partisan animosity over Trump’s election loss and his fraud allegation linger.

Talking over FaceTime in the back seat of a friend’s car Jan. 7, Farmer didn’t exactly say whether he believed Trump’s claim that the election was stolen. But he told the reporter that he didn’t “realistically” think the results would be overturned, and that he hadn’t expected violence, according to video of the interview provided by the affiliate, WLEX. He said he joined the rally to be present at something historic, and to people-watch.

“We kind of just wanted to see what would happen, and we knew that this would probably never happen again, that type of rally to support a president that’s going out,” Farmer said. “And, you know, there's millions of Americans that think the election wasn't exactly fair, you know, and there's a lot of voting discrepancies and things like that and it’s just something we wanted to take part in and just see.”

Farmer said the “extremists” and “weak-minded” people who rioted had darkened an otherwise peaceful rally. He called the siege “embarrassing” and “disgraceful” and said he did not want to be identified with it.

But it was too late for that.

Old complaints get new life

Last summer, after the police killing of George Floyd sparked a national debate about race and policing, Focus on Race Relations: Frankfort began asking residents if they had problems with any local officers. Farmer’s name came up repeatedly, members said.

In late August, leaders of the group met in person with Quire, the sheriff, and told him that they’d heard stories about Farmer harassing people, using excessive force, racial profiling and not wearing a body camera, said Kristie Powe, the group’s president. The activists didn’t share the names of the people who’d complained, or when the run-ins with Farmer happened. They also mentioned Facebook posts in which Farmer allegedly had condemned a local school’s plans to assign a novel that discussed racism in law enforcement.

“I just wanted to know the facts, what is being done, and do you recognize this as an issue,” Powe, who is Black, recalled of the meeting with Quire. “I want to be fair, as well. I don’t know Farmer, I’m not trying to ruin his life. My concern is for the Black people in this community. There are problems that people are reporting and I want to make sure those are being addressed.”

Quire is an elected Democrat who, like 37 of his 40 deputies, is white. At the meeting, he said he was familiar with one of the complaints, in which a person claimed Farmer pulled a gun on them in a situation that didn’t call for it, according to Margaret O’Donnell, a Focus on Race Relations: Frankfort member who attended the meeting. He thanked the activists for sharing their concerns, she said.

The activists said they heard little about Farmer after that — until Jan. 6.

Farmer’s critics say the detective should have known what the Jan. 6 rally represented, the rhetoric that would be voiced, and that extremists would be among the crowd.

Powe said his participation in the rally “was adding more fuel to fire to what we felt we were experiencing with Farmer, and we wanted to know if something was going to be done.”

Her group met with Goodrich, the public defender, and told him about the August meeting with Quire. Goodrich’s team compiled a handful of cases in which Black clients accused Farmer of misconduct.

The cases included a man facing charges for allegedly smoking marijuana in a parked car in 2019, who accused Farmer of jumping out, pointing a gun in his face and threatening to shoot him — allegations that a judge ultimately dismissed. Another man, arrested by Farmer on gun charges in 2019, accused the detective of making false statements in his application for a search warrant; that man pleaded guilty to reduced charges before a judge could hold a hearing on the claims.

Another man who has been stopped or arrested by Farmer multiple times said in an interview with NBC News that the detective had searched cars without probable cause, seized his phones and harassed him in public. The man, 26, who did not want to be identified by name out of fear of retribution, said he felt forced to plead guilty to low-level marijuana charges and became convinced Farmer was following him.

“He targets you unfairly when you’re going about your lawful business and you can’t shake him off your back,” the man said.

On Jan. 8, Goodrich and his colleagues sent a letter to Quire, asking him to investigate Farmer’s activities at the rally, and cases “which reflect targeting and racial profiling.”

The letter also mentioned that Farmer had resigned from the nearby Versailles Police Department in 2011 after coming under investigation for misconduct. Farmer’s letter of resignation, obtained by the public defender’s office through a public records request and shared with NBC News, details the accusations, including lying to a commander and having someone under criminal indictment to his house for a birthday party. The Versailles Police Department declined to comment.

“We will no longer silently stand by and allow Deputy Farmer to stain the reputation of Franklin County and cripple the individual lives who we represent,” the lawyers wrote.

The local newspaper, The State-Journal, reported on the letter and continued to follow the issue as it unfolded.

Quire considered the allegations for a few days, then released a statement supporting Farmer’s First Amendment right to attend the rally and saying there was no evidence that he had broken any laws. But Quire also announced an investigation into the complaints against Farmer, and his presence at the rally, and reassigned him from narcotics duty.

Reached by email, Farmer declined to comment, but said his lawyers would speak on his behalf once the investigation, conducted by a former FBI agent, ended.

Wills, the sheriff’s office spokesman, defended Farmer, who won the agency’s Deputy of the Year award in 2015 and 2019 and won a public poll that named him Frankfort’s “Favorite Law Enforcement Officer” in 2018.

The honors, Wills said, reflected “the cases he worked, his work ethic, that he’s always willing to help people in the public, along with the deputies he works with.”

Wills said Farmer’s reassignment to desk duty was not a punishment but a move to keep him safe while the investigation was underway.

“He’s got a target on his back, and we can’t put him out there when so many people are against him,” Wills said.

'One of the best narcotics detectives'

The investigation was welcomed by some in Franklin County, but it angered Farmer’s supporters, who believed he had done nothing wrong in Washington and was targeted because he was such an effective narcotics investigator.

“When he came back from the rally, all the people that had grudges against him just got louder, just smelled blood in the water, and started attacking him, whether it had a credible basis or not,” Gerald Hedrick said.

Hedrick, 51, who is white, said he has relied on Farmer to curb drug traffic in his neighborhood in Frankfort’s Thornhill section, where he lives with his wife, four adopted children and two foster children. Hedrick recalled texting photos of drug activity to Farmer, who would target people for arrest.

“He just delivers,” Hedrick said. “Helping us try to get these people out of our neighborhoods is what he seems to thrive on.”

Tammy Ricketts was so irked by the hubbub over Farmer that she wrote a letter to the newspaper praising him. In an interview, Ricketts, 53, said she speaks from experience because Farmer has arrested her son, a recovering addict, many times.

“That tells me he’s doing his job,” Ricketts, who is white, said. “He’s been one of the best narcotics detectives in this town in a mighty long time.”

Larry Cleveland, Franklin County’s elected lead prosecutor, knows Farmer well and respects his work. Cleveland is a Democrat and does not support Trump. He said he wished Farmer didn’t go to the rally. But he also said the detective did nothing wrong in doing so.

“Jeff Farmer is just a blue-collar good ol’ boy and going to this for him was like going to see Willie Nelson,” Cleveland said. “I don’t think he had any malicious or bad intent of any sort and I don’t think had any thought of anything bad happening as a result of him going.”

Cleveland also said he had never witnessed any of the misconduct alleged by the public defender’s office: “He’s been very effective as a narcotics officer and the criminal defense attorneys want to get rid of him. Like taking the star player out of the game.”

Unanswered questions

Franklin County is now waiting for the results of Quire's independent investigation. Goodrich, whose letter prompted it, said he doesn’t expect the findings to change many minds — about Farmer, about Trump or about law enforcement. If anything, he said, the process so far has reinforced people’s views.

“If you wave the Blue Lives Matter flag, you believe we’re stomping on his First Amendment rights, and if you believe there is an issue with race and policing in America, we said what you think needed to be said,” Goodrich said.

But he said that something crucial has already happened: a community debate about the intersection of policing, race, politics and fairness.

“In our small-town way, this issue has made Franklin County think about these things when perhaps we hadn’t,” Goodrich said. “Maybe for too long we’ve been a place where everybody knows everybody and we haven’t had hard conversations about race and policing.”

CORRECTION (Feb. 4, 2021, 8:43 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the outcome of one of the claims against Farmer, in which a man arrested on gun charges in 2019 accused Farmer of making false statements in his application for a search warrant.

It was around noon, just before a mob of far-right rioters, including white supremacists and anti-government militia members, broke away from the rally and stormed the U.S. Capitol. Even then, the court officials on the call expressed concern about a local law enforcement officer attending an event supporting Trump’s false claim that the election had been stolen. “You and other defense attorneys are going to have a field day with him,” Goodrich recalled one of the officials telling him.

The detective, a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy named Jeff Farmer, did not join those who attacked the Capitol and has not been charged with a crime. But his participation in Trump’s rally put fresh focus on his work in Franklin County, where Goodrich and his co-workers say Farmer was known for his zealous pursuit of drug offenders.

Farmer, who is white, was popular among law enforcement and residents who’d sought his help with drug activity in their neighborhoods. But Goodrich and a local civil rights group knew his name because some of those Farmer arrested in recent years, including about half a dozen clients of the public defender’s office, claimed in court filings that he had improperly searched them, used excessive force or targeted them because they were Black.

The civil rights group, Focus on Race Relations: Frankfort, had shared Black residents’ concerns about Farmer with Sheriff Chris Quire last summer. Little had come of it: Many of the complaints were informal, and of the allegations that were raised in court, most had been dismissed by judges or abandoned when defendants agreed to plea deals.

But that changed Jan. 6, with Farmer suddenly in the spotlight. A public outcry led Quire to launch an investigation into Farmer’s participation in the rally and the previous complaints against him, which prompted a furious response from the deputy’s supporters. The debate has split a community already divided over Trump, the election results and the public’s trust in law enforcement.

The sheriff’s office has been barraged with messages — both complaints about Farmer and praise for him.

“Half of the county is against him, half of the county is for him,” said Capt. Daniel Wills, a spokesman for the department, who defended Farmer’s work ethic and said he has “done a tremendous job.”

Farmer declined to comment.

The conflict in Franklin County has been repeated across the country over the past month, as communities learn that local police officers traveled to Washington for the Trump demonstration. Some, including officers from Houston and Rocky Mount, Virginia, were accused of joining the Capitol riot and now face criminal charges.

But more than two dozen other police officers have said they attended the rally but did not join in the violence that followed. In addition to Farmer, the list includes a Kentucky state trooper, a police chief in New Hampshire, five Seattle officers and seven members of Philadelphia’s public transit police agency. Officers and their supporters say they were exercising their First Amendment rights.

While the officers have not been accused of breaking any laws, several agencies have launched internal investigations into possible violations of their codes of conduct. They also want to understand what drew the officers to the rally, which was timed to coincide with Congress’ certifying the election results and followed weeks of online mobilizing by extremist groups calling for an occupation of the Capitol.

“The march was based on a lie — ’stop the steal,’ the election was stolen,” Goodrich said. “So much of Deputy Farmer’s work as a detective is determining when people are telling the truth and lying to him. It raises questions about his ability to do his job as a detective when he’s engaged in a rally in support of a belief that so many members of the community believe is utterly without support.”

A trip to the rally

There was nothing secret about Farmer’s participation in the Jan. 6 rally. He documented his arrival with friends on Facebook, and after the siege wrote a post in which he called the rioters “idiots” and questioned whether they were really Trump supporters. (Farmer’s Facebook page has been deleted, but screenshots of the post were provided to NBC News by people who were friends with him on the site.)

The next day, on the drive back to Kentucky, Farmer got on a video call with a reporter from the local NBC affiliate in Lexington. Wearing a hoodie with a Fraternal Order of Police logo, Farmer said he’d gone to Washington to celebrate Trump’s four years in office.

In the courthouse and in neighborhoods with high drug traffic, Farmer is a familiar presence, welcomed by some and feared by others. People who have called the sheriff’s office to report drug activity and got a response from Farmer say he is relentless in his pursuit of the bottom- and mid-rung players in the local narcotics economy. Some of those who become his target say he often goes too far, using questionable reasons to stop, search and charge them — although the sheriff’s office says it has no record of formal complaints lodged against Farmer. His world is a tiny slice of America’s never-ending war on drugs.

Franklin County is the home of Frankfort, the state capital, and Kentucky State University, a historically Black institution; residents say it has a small-town feel. About 50,000 people live in the county, 82 percent of them white and about 9 percent Black. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2-to-1 — an anomaly in deeply red Kentucky — but Trump carried the county in November by 248 votes.

Because Frankfort is the seat of state power, it was the site of a number of emotionally charged protests in 2020, from Black Lives Matter marches in response to the killing of Breonna Taylor in a botched police raid in Louisville to conservative demonstrations against coronavirus lockdown orders. Partisan animosity over Trump’s election loss and his fraud allegation linger.

Talking over FaceTime in the back seat of a friend’s car Jan. 7, Farmer didn’t exactly say whether he believed Trump’s claim that the election was stolen. But he told the reporter that he didn’t “realistically” think the results would be overturned, and that he hadn’t expected violence, according to video of the interview provided by the affiliate, WLEX. He said he joined the rally to be present at something historic, and to people-watch.

Gavin Newsom is recalled?,[''],en,2021-02-07 02:56:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com,,set(),"As the recall effort against California Gov. Gavin Newsom heats up, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer is hoping to accomplish what no Republican has since 2003: become governor of one of the bluest states in the country.

“I believe Californians want a change,” Faulconer said. “As we look at the reality, we all love our state, but what we’re seeing is jobs are fleeing. Our state can’t do the basics.”

Faulconer, who served as mayor from 2014 to 2020, announced his candidacy this week following months of attacks against Newsom over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. In an online video released Monday, the 54-year-old moderate depicted California as a failed state fraught with scandal and a worsening quality of life. He said he is running “to make a difference, not to make promises.”

“He’s failed us,” Faulconer said of Newsom in the video. “I know we can clean up California.”

As of this week, volunteers have collected more than 1.4 million signatures statewide in support of recalling Newsom. The campaign must gather 1.5 million signatures by mid-March to force an election, and it will need a surplus of signatures because some are likely to be disqualified during the certification process. State officials had verified 410,000 as of early January.

Fueled by an economic downturn during the coronavirus pandemic, Newsom critics say the governor has kept public schools closed too long and failed to fix the state’s unemployment benefits system, its record homelessness and an affordable housing shortage.

According to a poll released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, 54 percent of Californians approve of Newsom’s job performance, down from 65 percent in May.

What started as a conservative-led recall effort has gained bipartisan support in recent months with Democrats also criticizing Newsom over his shifting Covid-19 vaccine strategy and for allowing schools to stay closed. Now, Faulconer is promising a ""California comeback"" if voters chose him over Newsom.

“The recall will happen,” said Thad Kousser, political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “Clearly Republicans smell blood, and this is the best shot of flipping a blue state.”

Still, Kousser described Faulconer’s chances of beating Newsom as a “long shot.”

“The Republican party [in California] has been declining steadily, and really became politically irrelevant,” he said. “You had a Republican party that was clearly putting itself at odds with the diverse electorate of California.”

Faulconer considers himself a different kind of conservative. Raised in Oxnard, a coastal city northwest of Los Angeles, Faulconer learned Spanish at an early age and has stayed away from the anti-immigrant rhetoric that ultimately doomed another Republican, former Gov. Pete Wilson.

Faulconer won two terms in a majority Democratic city with a majority Democratic council. As mayor of California's second-largest city, with a population of 1.4 million, he helped to curb homelessness in San Diego, relocating people living on the streets to the city’s convention center after a hepatitis A outbreak swept through the population. Afterward, his office's efforts helped hundreds of people without homes to find housing solutions, NBC San Diego reported.

“We have to say that it is unacceptable to allow people to live and die on our sidewalks,” Faulconer said. “I believe individuals have a right to shelter.”

Despite some achievements in alleviating the city’s homelessness problem, Faulconer has been criticized for relying too heavily on law enforcement to sweep people off the streets. Police teams cleaned up sidewalks and cleared encampments, and a new law banned sleeping in cars. People experiencing homelessness were swept into temporary shelters, but housing costs remain high throughout the city.

Under his watch, the Chargers football team relocated to Los Angeles after 55 years. Faulconer said the decision was made by the team: ""It was a done deal.""

Another likely challenge for Faulconer is his support for former President Donald Trump. He voted for Trump in 2020 after saying four years earlier that “his divisive rhetoric is unacceptable,” the Los Angeles Times reported.

Since November, Faulconer has brushed aside any potential handicap his voting record could pose in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Joe Biden.

“We have our own unique brand,” he said of conservatives in California. “I consider myself a California Republican who is fiscally sound, cares about the environment, builds bridges and gets results.”

Faulconer is one of several Republicans who have signaled interest in unseating Newsom. Businessman John Cox is considering a run against the governor if the recall effort is successful. It would be the second time Cox takes on Newsom - he lost to the current governor in 2018.

Faulconer said that even if he does not succeed in beating Newsom during a special election, he will run for governor again in 2022.",Is former San Diego mayor 'best shot' to flip blue California in recall election?

The campaign must gather 1.5 million signatures by mid-March to force an election, and it will need a surplus of signatures because some are likely to be disqualified during the certification process. State officials had verified 410,000 as of early January.

Fueled by an economic downturn during the coronavirus pandemic, Newsom critics say the governor has kept public schools closed too long and failed to fix the state’s unemployment benefits system, its record homelessness and an affordable housing shortage.

According to a poll released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, 54 percent of Californians approve of Newsom’s job performance, down from 65 percent in May.

What started as a conservative-led recall effort has gained bipartisan support in recent months with Democrats also criticizing Newsom over his shifting Covid-19 vaccine strategy and for allowing schools to stay closed. Now, Faulconer is promising a ""California comeback"" if voters chose him over Newsom.

“The recall will happen,” said Thad Kousser, political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “Clearly Republicans smell blood, and this is the best shot of flipping a blue state.”

Still, Kousser described Faulconer’s chances of beating Newsom as a “long shot.”

“The Republican party [in California] has been declining steadily, and really became politically irrelevant,” he said. “You had a Republican party that was clearly putting itself at odds with the diverse electorate of California.”

Faulconer considers himself a different kind of conservative. Raised in Oxnard, a coastal city northwest of Los Angeles, Faulconer learned Spanish at an early age and has stayed away from the anti-immigrant rhetoric that ultimately doomed another Republican, former Gov. Pete Wilson.

Faulconer won two terms in a majority Democratic city with a majority Democratic council. As mayor of California's second-largest city, with a population of 1.4 million, he helped to curb homelessness in San Diego, relocating people living on the streets to the city’s convention center after a hepatitis A outbreak swept through the population. Afterward, his office's efforts helped hundreds of people without homes to find housing solutions, NBC San Diego reported.

“We have to say that it is unacceptable to allow people to live and die on our sidewalks,” Faulconer said. “I believe individuals have a right to shelter.”

Despite some achievements in alleviating the city’s homelessness problem, Faulconer has been criticized for relying too heavily on law enforcement to sweep people off the streets. Police teams cleaned up sidewalks and cleared encampments, and a new law banned sleeping in cars. People experiencing homelessness were swept into temporary shelters, but housing costs remain high throughout the city.

Under his watch, the Chargers football team relocated to Los Angeles after 55 years. Faulconer said the decision was made by the team: ""It was a done deal.""

Another likely challenge for Faulconer is his support for former President Donald Trump. He voted for Trump in 2020 after saying four years earlier that “his divisive rhetoric is unacceptable,” the Los Angeles Times reported.

Since November, Faulconer has brushed aside any potential handicap his voting record could pose in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Joe Biden.

“We have our own unique brand,” he said of conservatives in California. “I consider myself a California Republican who is fiscally sound, cares about the environment, builds bridges and gets results.”

Faulconer is one of several Republicans who have signaled interest in unseating Newsom. Businessman John Cox is considering a run against the governor if the recall effort is successful. It would be the second time Cox takes on Newsom - he lost to the current governor in 2018.

Faulconer said that even if he does not succeed in beating Newsom during a special election, he will run for governor again in 2022.",Is former San Diego mayor 'best shot' to flip blue California in recall election?

From emerging talents like Naima Green, Salman Toor and Shikeith to more established artists like Zanele Muholi, Julie Mehretu and Laura Aguilar, Black and brown voices are headlining a bold lineup of global exhibitions by queer artists in the coming months.

Here are the top current and imminent shows that you should safely do your best to see — noting of course that museums are still subject to ever-shifting local lockdown restrictions. Temporary closings are noted below and accurate as of press time, but they are dependent on shifting pandemic winds.

Now, his district looks to Torres, 32, through the challenges of Covid-19.",[''],en,2021-02-01 02:34:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com,,set(),"Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., could “feel the weight of history” on his shoulders as the freshman member of Congress entered the House floor for the first time Jan. 3. The office where Rep. John F. Kennedy once sat now has Torres’ name on it.

“It was surreal for me to go to my office for the first time,” Torres said. “I never thought I would embark on a journey that would take me from public housing in the Bronx to the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.”

Torres, 32, made history as the first gay Afro Latino person elected to Congress. The son of a Black mother and a Puerto Rican father, he represents New York’s 15th congressional district, located entirely within the Bronx, where he was born and raised. His district, the most Democratic one in the country, is 64 percent Latino and 30 percent Black.

""I was raised by a single mother who raised three children on minimum wage,” he said. “The South Bronx is full of single mothers like mine who have struggled, sacrificed and suffered so that their children can have a better life than they did.”

“My rise to Congress belongs as much to my mother as it does to me,” Torres said.

'A larger story'

Torres steps into office during one of the most challenging times in recent U.S. history — more than 427,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus pandemic and over 25 million have been infected by the virus. His community has been hit hard; since the beginning of the pandemic, Covid-19 hospitalizations and death rates have been consistently high in the Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the country.

“Covid-19 is more than a public health crisis,"" he said. ""It tells a larger story about the deeper inequalities and injustices of American society — the digital divide, a lack of access to fresh food, lack of income, housing insecurity, severe overcrowding, lack of access to health care, pre-existing conditions — all of these are manifestations of systemic racism.""

In his first week in Washington, D.C., tackling the effects of the pandemic would soon compete with another crisis.

Just a few days after Torres was sworn into office, a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol. The rioters, many of them aligned with white supremacist groups and ideals, effectively paused a ceremonial event Jan. 6 meant to affirm that then-President elect Joe Biden had won the November election.

“The insurrection is not only a siege on the capital. It’s a siege on the 117th Congress, the most diverse Congress in the history of the United States,"" Torres said. ""It’s a siege on multiracial, multiethnic democracy.""

Torres joined lawmakers in the House who voted to impeach Trump.

“A year ago, if you had said to me that I would become a member of Congress during an infectious disease outbreak, that I would witness a violent assault on the Capitol during the Electoral College vote count and that I would vote to impeach Donald Trump, I would have said, ‘That sounds like quite the movie,’” he said.

From 'lowest point' to youngest council member

Torres was born in 1988, just five minutes after his twin brother. His mother named him after the late Mexican American singer Ritchie Valens following the release of the 1987 film “La Bamba.”

“She named my brother after the Reuben sandwich, and me after Ritchie Valens. You can infer who’s the favorite son,” Torres said jokingly.

His mother raised the twins and their sister in a small New York City Housing Authority apartment, which Torres said had mold, leaks, lead, ""and without consistent heat and hot water in the winter.”

Before making history in Congress, Torres became the youngest member of the New York City Council at age 25 and the first openly gay candidate to be elected to legislative office in the Bronx. As a council member, he helped secure a $3 billion Federal Emergency Management Agency grant after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the already-deteriorated housing authority buildings and opened the first shelter for LGBTQ young adults in the Bronx.

“What's remarkable is that seven years before that, I was at the lowest point in my life,” he said.

Torres had recently dropped out of college after struggling with depression, substance abuse and grief after the loss of his best friend, who died of an opioid overdose. “There were moments when I thought of taking my own life because the world around me had collapsed,” he said.

He found an opportunity to channel his interests around affordable housing issues while working in the office of City Council member Jimmy Vacca. Torres later ran and was elected to the City Council in 2013. “Even in your moments of greatest darkness, never lose hope,” he said. “For me, that’s the lesson learned from my life.”

The 'blessing and burden'

The pandemic has reinforced Torres' central mission “to break the cycle of racially concentrated poverty,” starting with tackling decades of federal disinvestment in the housing authority, which houses more than 400,000 low-income New Yorkers.

While his political career is mostly shaped by his experience growing up in public housing, he also campaigned on job creation initiatives, addressing health disparities and public school segregation, and expanding services for the elderly, youth and immigrants.

“We've seen in America, the unraveling of the social safety net,"" Torres said, ""and the communities that pay the heaviest price are communities of color, which have been left behind by the federal government and which have been hit hardest by Covid-19.""

He acknowledges there's a lot to tackle.

""Representation is as much a blessing as it is a burden,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for the blessing and burden of public service; I promised my constituents that I would work my heart out for them.""

""I was careful to tell them I'm not a miracle worker, I cannot pluck a magic wand out of thin air and magically solve every problem, but I am a worker. I am a fighter,"" he said.

Torres recently partnered with Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., who is also of Puerto Rican heritage, to urge the Biden administration to release disaster recovery funds to Puerto Rico, and with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to support essential workers on a weeklong strike to demand higher wages.

A 'passing of the torch'

Torres managed to ascend through the ranks of the New York City Council and prevail in a crowded primary last summer to replace Rep. José Serrano, a 16-term Democrat from the South Bronx, who announced his retirement in 2019 after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

Serrano's departure was ""a big deal,” Ed García Conde, a longtime Bronx resident and activist, said. “A lot of people that I know, including myself, were concerned about losing a Puerto Rican member of Congress with all that seniority who could be a voice for the Puerto Rican community — for us, visibility and representation continue to matter.”

""The South Bronx has been a dumping ground for a lot of pollution,” whether it’s because of truck traffic or factories, said García Conde, who founded the hyperlocal news site Welcome2TheBronx. The district has high rates of asthma and other health issues, making environmental justice a key issue, he said.

During his campaign, Torres raised significantly more money than at least nine other of his opponents combined. Unlike some of his rivals, he didn’t restrict himself from accepting money from donors with connections to real estate and others corporate interests, a move that drew skepticism among some progressive Democrats. Two major LGBTQ political groups, Equality PAC and The Victory Fund, also fundraised on his behalf in an effort to give him an edge over opponent Ruben Díaz Sr., who has a history of anti-gay remarks.

Torres said that while he considers himself “my own person with my own priorities and experiences, it's not lost on me that I am continuing half a century of tradition of Latino leadership in the South Bronx — from Herman Badillo to Bob García, to José Serrano, to myself.” He said, ""When José Serrano first entered the United States Congress, I was only two. So, the fact that I'm succeeding him at age 32, represents a genuine passing of the torch.”

As he begins his freshman year in Congress, Torres said voters know his deep roots in the community, as well as his story.

""No one has handed me anything on a silver platter,"" he said. ""I've had to fight for everything that I have in my life.""

With COVID-19 back on the rise in the United States and parts of the country turning back to restrictions, we're continuously left finding creative ways to resume our normal daily routines inside our homes. Home gym equipment paired with virtual workouts has become increasingly popular as a way to stay in shape and as a good mental break during a stressful time, long before coronavirus was on our minds and with renewed vigor since, from exercise bikes and treadmills to under-desk ellipticals and TRX-like trainers. Fitness studios are offering instructor-led workout classes via Zoom and Instagram Live so you can still break a sweat in your sweats — which has prompted people to turn their living rooms into makeshift gyms fully equipped with yoga mats, kettlebells, and resistance bands.

SKIP AHEAD Best dumbbells to shop

The unexpected and sudden peaking of at-home workouts can take some time getting used to especially if you normally like to do circuit training or prefer to do your workouts on a treadmill. However, the good news is you can still get a good workout at home and build muscle at the same time by investing in basic fitness equipment like dumbbells. Are dumbbells a good investment? They’re versatile, extremely effective in building strength and can be used in many different types of workouts. A seemingly simple purchase can be a daunting task if you don’t actually know what to look for, though. With so many options on the market, we decided to reach out to fitness experts to provide their recommendations for the best dumbbells in each category.

How to shop for dumbbells

It’s important to note that not all dumbbells are created equally. Jillian Michaels, health and fitness expert and creator of the My Fitness app, explained the most important factors to consider when shopping for dumbbells.

Fixed or adjustable weights

Fixed weights are eponymously named because they are a fixed weight that is usually sold in pairs. These are best for people who are just starting to lift weights, or want to focus on one area of the body. If you’re buying multiple fixed weight sizes then you’ll also need to consider storage space.

are eponymously named because they are a fixed weight that is usually sold in pairs. These are best for people who are just starting to lift weights, or want to focus on one area of the body. If you’re buying multiple fixed weight sizes then you’ll also need to consider storage space. Adjustable weights use a dial system to adjust the amount of weight on each dumbbell, including a safety lock to prevent the weights from falling off. Saving money and space is another convenience to consider with adjustable dumbbells -- you get the variety without having to purchase multiple dumbbell sets. These are best for people who like to lift heavier weights and weight train (weighted lunges, weighted squats, chest press, etc.)

Dumbbell material

Dumbbells can be made using several different types of material including rubber, neoprene or metal. Rubber and neoprene are softer and less prone to damaging floors, which makes them more ideal for use at home.

Dumbbell shape

Dumbbells come in two shapes: hex and circle. Dumbbells with hexagonal ends are much less likely to roll away when placed on the floor. The best dumbbell shape for you depends on how you plan on using them. If you plan on doing exercises that use the dumbbells as platforms (like a renegade row), then you might want the hex shape. If you want to use the dumbbells like an ab roller you might prefer the circle.

Best dumbbells to shop

Choosing a dumbbell that’s comfortable for you is a personal preference. You want to pay attention to the grip and the size of the handle, as well as the dumbbell’s shape, material and cost. “Heavier doesn’t necessarily mean better,” said Leyon Azubuike, founder and CEO of Gloveworx. “You have to make the weight work for you and make sure they feel comfortable in your hands!”

Best all-around dumbbell: CAP

Melissa Vogel, Aerobics and Fitness Association of America and certified personal trainer and certified group fitness instructor — who mostly works with busy moms — said, “This one is great for a little more advanced and serious client that is looking to take their at-home workout to the next level.” The set includes weights that range from five to 25 pounds, which is convenient for a variety of workouts. The steel handles sport medium-depth diamond knurling meant to provide a secure, non-slip grip when working out. The cast iron heads are also coated with a protective layer not only to reduce damage to the equipment itself, but to your floors, as well.

Best affordable dumbbell: CAP

If you’re looking for something basic and don’t want to spend a lot of money on a big set, Vogel recommends CAP’s Iron Hex model. “They are basic, sturdy, and reliable,” she told Shopping. “They also have a hexagon shape to the ends that allow you to balance on them for planks and other body resistance/isolation moves.” These dumbbells have a baked-in enamel coating for better durability.

Best high-end dumbbell: BowFlex

Believe it or not, even dumbbells can be high-tech these days. Michaels prefers the BowFlex SelectTech 1090 model which can be used with the free BowFlex SelectTech app that allows you to keep track of your reps. This model also has the largest weight range, from 10 pounds and up to 90 pounds in 5-pound weight increments. “If the sky is the limit here, the Bowflex SelectTech 1090s are awesome. They have the dial system. They have a special shape so they don’t roll around [and] they don’t take up a ton of space. The only downside is they are still metal, but the product is well built and doesn’t clank when you lift them,” said Michaels.

Best dumbbells for smaller hands: Ativafit

Nicole Ferrier, an American Council on Exercise certified personal trainer said the Ativafit adjustable dumbbell is her top choice for an at-home gym, noting typical hand sizes she's come across. “Women should look for dumbbells with smaller grips on the handle. This is because a female’s hand is smaller than a male’s hand. Having a firm grip is essential to lift safely and comfortably.” The space-saving design takes seven sets of weights and puts them into one plastic tray, and makes it easy to switch to your desired weight.

Best dumbbells for comfort: Bowflex and NordicTrack

“Personally I make sure the dumbbells have a short handle so they are far easier to balance when I’m lifting heavy,” said Jillian Michaels. Some handles are also knurled, which means the grip is lined with a raised pattern with ridges that allows for a better hold. The Bowflex SelectTech 552 has a straight handle with extra grip and the coating on the weights allows for a more silent workout. At the end of the dumbbells is a dial so you can easily adjust the weight and resistance to best suit your workout.

NordicTrack appeared in many of our fitness equipment roundups, from exercise bikes to treadmills. This set of adjustable dumbbells are similar to the Bowflex model (and look similar, too), but reach a slightly higher maximum weight per dumbbell: 55 pounds (as opposed to Bowflex's 52.5 pounds). The set comes with a free year of iFit, a fitness subscription that gives you access to live and on-demand workouts and classes (normally $468). To adjust the weights, you can remove a simple notch at the top of the dumbbell to the proper spot for your desired weight.

Best dumbbells for beginners: SPRI

Beginners will require less weight range and won’t need any of the fancy bells and whistles (like Bluetooth capability) so the options are more affordable. Michaels recommended these light hand weights — which you can get in either 3-pound or 8-pound version. They also have a hex cap and vinyl cover for protection.

Best dumbells for durability: Weider

Dumbbells can be costly, but if you invest in a high-quality pair of weights and they are stored properly they can last for many years. Certain materials like metal can show signs of wear and tear sooner than other materials so if you’re looking to invest in weights for the long haul, consider dumbbells with a protective rubber coating. It not only lasts longer but doesn’t make as much noise when dropped on the ground. Azubuike recommended Weider Fitness dumbbells and said they are cost-friendly and have a good range. “I’ve been trusting these since my collegiate athlete days [and] they are durable! They won’t tear your hands up and they have a good grip,” he said.

Tom Brady still tops with seventh title as Buccaneers rip Chiefs in Super Bowl 55

Eleven months after he shocked the sports world by leaving the New England Patriots in free agency and signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tom Brady lived up to all of the expectations heaped on him. Sunday, in Super Bowl 55, playing in the stadium that he now calls home and hosting the team that many projected as the league’s next dynasty, Brady led the Buccaneers to a 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. For the 43-year-old Brady, it was a remarkable seventh Super Bowl victory and his second in the last three years. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers snapped an 18-year drought and won the second Super Bowl in franchise history. Tossing three touchdown passes (all in the first half), Brady took home MVP honors for the fifth time in his storied career.

Pfizer to cut COVID-19 vaccine production time by close to 50%

Pfizer expects to cut the amount of time it takes to produce a COVID-19 vaccine nearly in half, from 110 days to an average of 60 as it makes the process more efficient and production is built out. For example, making the DNA that starts the vaccine process first took 16 days. Soon it will take nine or 10. Though quality control and testing has accelerated, company officials say FDA regulations and best manufacturing practices are still being met. And as the nation revs up its vaccination programs, the increase could help relieve bottlenecks caused by vaccine shortages

In addition: California is adding mass inoculation sites even as the shortage of COVID-19 vaccine has local officials restricting who gets shots, with Los Angeles County saying it will limit new vaccinations to ensure second doses are available to those already in line for them. And in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted the state's limited mask requirement on Sunday, along with the social distance and other limitations she had in place for businesses and social gatherings.

President Biden won't lift sanctions on Iran to get new nuke deal

President Joe Biden had a simple response when asked whether his administration would lift sanctions on Iran to bring the country back to the negotiating table: “No.” Biden, during an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Nora O'Donnell, elaborated that Iran would need to stop enriching nuclear fissile material. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday said the U.S. would need to lift sanctions before Iran meets its commitments. In 2015, the Obama administration had negotiated a deal in which major European nations would lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country limiting its nuclear program. But in 2018, then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal that he'd said was too lenient.

Winter storm sweeps (again) across the snow-weary East Coast

A winter storm rolled up the snow-weary East Coast on Sunday, threatening to pound some areas with a foot of snow just a week after a powerful Nor'easter blitzed parts of the region. AccuWeather meteorologists said the emerging weather pattern did not appear to threaten a repeat of the blockbuster storm that shattered snowfall records last week. About 50 million people were under a winter storm watch or warning. New York City, still recovering from almost two feet of snow, was forecast to see 4 to 8 inches before the snow ends on Sunday night. The storm comes as a blast of Arctic air from Canada began sweeping the season's coldest air yet across the Plains.

Amanda Gorman, the National Youth Poet Laureate who captivated the nation at President Joe Biden's inauguration, recited an original poem Sunday for Super Bowl 55, honoring frontline workers and three honorary game captains chosen by the NFL.

The honorary captains included Marine Corps veteran James Martin, COVID ICU nurse manager Suzie Dorner and educator Trimaine Davis.

Highlights from her poem, ""Chorus of the Captains"": ""Today we honor our three captains for their actions and impact in a time of uncertainty and need. They've taken the need, exceeding all expectations and limitations, uplifting their communities and neighbors, healers and educators.

""James has felt the wounds of warfare but this warrior still shares his home with at-risk kids. During COVID, he has even lent a hand, live-streaming football for fans and family.

""Tremaine is an educator who works non-stop, providing his community with hotspots, laptops and tent workshops so his students have all the tools they need to succeed in life and in schools.

""Suzie is the ICU nurse manager at a Tampa hospital. Her chronicles prove that even in tragedy, hope is possible. She lost her grandmothers to the pandemic and fights to save other lives in the ICU battle zone, defining the frontline heroes risking their lives for our own.""

Gorman made Super Bowl history as the first poet to perform for a game.

Since reciting her original poem, ""The Hill We Climb"" at President Joe Biden’s inauguration, Gorman, 22, has become a star. She has appeared on late-night and daytime TV, signed with IMG Models, landed on the cover of Time magazine and has seen her three books become top sellers.

Long before Gorman took the stage in January, she had been in talks with Super Bowl officials.

""We first met with Amanda’s team in early November, and then with her at the end of that month, so we’ve been familiar with her talent and power for awhile now,"" Matt Shapiro, the NFL’s vice president of events strategy, said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports.

""We at the league have been big fans of her work for some time and knew she’d be the perfect person to bring power and unity to this unique moment in an unprecedented year.""

After the NFL announced that Gorman would perform during pregame festivities, she shared the news on Twitter, telling fans she had known about the Super Bowl role weeks before the inauguration.

""I also wanted to be the first to say that while it might seem like this opportunity must’ve came from my inauguration fame, I’ve actually been talking with the Super Bowl for weeks now, far prior to my invite to the inauguration. Had to keep my blessing secret till now.""

Miley Cyrus shared the stage with Billy Idol during her TikTok Tailgate pregame concert performance in Tampa Bay before Super Bowl 55, bringing the rocker onstage with a simple, ""Hey, Billy Idol.""

After singing their Plastic Hearts collaboration ""Night Crawling,"" the two joined forces for Idol's 1980s hit ""White Wedding"" with Cyrus, dressed in a pink and black cheerleader outfit (and matching knee pads), dancing suggestively in between vocal turns.

Cyrus kicked off the TikTok Tailgate, her first concert in more than a year, with her own take on Toni Basil's ""Mickey,"" turning the lyrics to ""Miley"" when asking the crowd to sing along. She performed ""Prisoner,"" covered Blondie’s ""Heart of Glass,"" Nine Inch Nails' ""Head Like a Hole,"" and Dolly Parton's ""Jolene.""

Rocker Joan Jett joined Cyrus on the stage.

""An introduction seems insulting,"" said Cyrus as Jett took the stage. Instead the two gave a spirited version of ""Bad Reputation,"" ""Bad Karma"" and ""I Hate Myself for Loving You.""

The NFL announced last month that 7,500 vaccinated health care workers had been invited to attend Super Bowl LV at the Raymond James Stadium to watch the concert. Cyrus gave props to the workers during the show. ""I could not imagine a better to do this with all these health care heroes,"" said Cyrus from the stage. ""Surrounded by the people making this show possible. We are so appreciative of you and all your diligence. And for that we are going to rock hard.""

Now granted, it was 19 years ago and most current NFL stars were literally babies. USA TODAY

TAMPA, Fla. — Not everybody celebrated the NFL’s decision to invite 7,500 vaccinated health care workers to Super Bowl 55.

Outside Raymond James Stadium, site of the game, about 20 protesters voiced their opposition to vaccines — especially the vaccine for COVID-19.

“Please don’t get the vaccine. The media lied to you,"" one protester called out, citing a baseless claim.

Another held up small pieces of red paper.

“Fauci facts,"" she cried, referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a strong proponent of vaccines. “Learn about Fauci.""

The “facts’’ falsely implied Fauci's advocacy of vaccines over the years can be linked to an increase in chronic disease in children.

The group of protesters was part of 150 anti-vaxxers that was organized by the Florida Freedom Keepers and part of a campaign in all 50 states, said Josh Coleman, an organizer. He said he traveled from California to participate and, like the other protesters, wore a football referee outfit and held up a poster decrying vaccines, his reading, “Vaccine Makers Are Exempt From Liability.’’

“The whole idea here is just to bring attention to vaccine risks,’’ Coleman said. “A lot of the media’s not talking about vaccine risks and also healthcare workers aren’t talking about it. So we need to bring that out to people more than ever before and we’re taking advantage of situation where there’s a lot of people here and also question the COVID-19 vaccine.""

“We’re getting negative responses and we’re getting a lot of positive,’’ Coleman said. “A lot of the healthcare workers primarily are not too happy about it.""

Show Caption Hide Caption Fans celebrate Super Bowl outside Tampa stadium Even though this year's Super Bowl has limited areas for tailgating as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, fans still showed up to celebrate outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. (Feb. 7) AP

Public health officials and experts have warned that attending large events surrounding the Super Bowl could lead to similar spikes in COVID-19 cases, just as Thanksgiving and Christmas did.

Yet a number of celebrities – including performers and those participating in a celebrity flag football game – have been shown in photos and videos over the weekend in Tampa, Florida, going against safety guidelines put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health officials and event organizers.

Diplo, 50 Cent, Migos, Steve Aoki and Tory Lanez all performed during the Big Game Weekend event co-sponsored by Barstool Sports and Miami nightclub E11EVEN at Tampa's WTR Pool & Grill between Thursday and Saturday. Each performed without masks and in front of almost entirely maskless crowds at the outdoor venue, per videos captured by attendees.

USA TODAY has reached out to Tampa Police, the WTR Pool & Grill and E11EVEN and the stars' representatives for comment.

""This isn't how we should be celebrating the Super Bowl,"" tweeted St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman on Saturday, condemning photos from 50 Cent's show. ""It's not safe or smart. It's stupid. We're going to take a very close look at this, and it may end up costing someone a lot more than 50 cent.""

Diplo shared a series of photos to Instagram on Saturday, one of which appears to indicate he has received both doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Others show a sign that reads ""MASKS ARE MANDATORY"" and the DJ wearing a mask designed to look like his face. He wore the mask while taking photos prior to the event, but removed it for the performance.

The CDC say those who have received both doses should continue to wear masks and social distance: ""Not enough information is currently available to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.""

Lanez and several ""Bachelor"" franchise alums would go on to play in a celebrity flag football game on Sunday, also maskless, with only some attendees on the sidelines wearing masks, per video shared by Celebrity Sweat, the event's official organizer.

Former ""Bachelor"" Peter Weber, and former ""Bachelorette"" contestants Jason Tartick and Blake Horstmann, as well as several former NFL and WWE athletes, were among the game's participants. USA TODAY has reached out to Celebrity Sweat, Tartick and Horstmann. It was not immediately apparent if Weber had a representative.

According to Celebrity Sweat's website, this year's event was closed to the public and face masks were required. The Tampa Bay Times reports that more than 100 onlookers watched from behind the flag football game's barricades, ""almost all of them maskless.""

$15 beers? Super Bowl 55 concessions aren't cheap at Raymond James Stadium for Chiefs vs. Buccaneers

The NFL's safety precautions for the Super Bowl include capping attendance at 25,000 guests, nearly a third of whom will be vaccinated healthcare workers from Florida. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor has imposed a mask mandate for entertainment areas and set a $500 fine for violators. But enforcement has been problematic in a state where Gov. Ron DeSantis has banned localities from collecting mask fines.

""I’m encouraged by what I’m seeing the NFL doing at the actual game itself,’’ said Jill Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida in the College of Public Health. “I think within the stadium and the game itself, the risk is very low.

“My concern is an influx of people going to bars and restaurants and tailgating in areas near the stadium and all of those things. Super Bowl parties are going to be as big of a problem as gatherings at Thanksgiving and Christmas were, and we do know for sure those gatherings did influence the increase in cases that we’re seeing right now.""

As of Sunday, the U.S. is nearing 27 million COVID-19 cases and more than 463,300 deaths, per Johns Hopkins data.

Jazmine Sullivan and Eric Church got Sunday's Super Bowl 55 off to a low-key start.

The unlikely duo performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at the top of the game, which pits the Kansas City Chiefs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Wearing a purple jacket and playing guitar, Church began the anthem solo, quietly singing with his soulful twang. The song really took off when Sullivan, looking stunning in a jeweled headpiece and cream-colored pantsuit, joined in, effortlessly harmonizing with Church and showing off her stunning vocal range.

The performance belonged to Sullivan, whose powerful and passionate delivery outshone the more subdued Church. It called to mind the 2006 game, the last Super Bowl to feature two artists duetting on the anthem: Aretha Franklin and Aaron Neville. The legendary Franklin was somewhat mismatched with Neville, whose lethargic presence and feathery vocals never quite gelled with Franklin's mighty voice.

Sullivan and Church's lovely anthem ultimately fared much better than Christina Aguilera's lyric-flubbing rendition in 2011, although their agreeable performance lacked the ""wow"" of pop stars Lady Gaga (2016) and Demi Lovato (2020). And, of course, no one can ever top Whitney Houston's astonishing ""Star-Spangled Banner"" 30 years ago at the 1991 Super Bowl, a version so iconic that it became a hit single in itself, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Sullivan and Church had never collaborated before Sunday's game, held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, with a scaled-back crowd of 25,000 fans due to COVID-19 restrictions. Sullivan told Entertainment Tonight in late January that she had never met Church, but was excited to blend their respective R&B and country sounds.

""We definitely come from two totally different, um, everything,"" Sullivan said. ""But, I’m excited. I think it will be cool to blend the different sounds of music and just show some unity. I just hope that it brings unity and it shows that you can be from two different parts of life and come together for a good common cause.""

Minutes before the anthem at Sunday's game, R&B singer H.E.R. delivered a captivating take on ""America the Beautiful."" She rocked sunglasses, a leather jacket and sparkled jeans, and her performance culminated in a thrilling electric guitar solo.

Sullivan is a 12-time Grammy-nominated singer who hit the Top 5 on Billboard's mainstream R&B/hip-hop airplay chart in 2008, with singles ""Need U Bad"" and ""Bust Your Windows."" The 33-year-old recently returned after a six-year break between albums with last month's ""Heaux Tales,"" featuring collaborations with H.E.R. and Anderson .Paak.

Church, meanwhile, is gearing up to release a triple album project this spring titled ""Heart & Soul."" The new music, written pre-COVID shutdowns, will roll out starting April 16 with first album ""Heart."" The 43-year-old released two new songs, ""Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones"" and ""Lone Wolf,"" on Friday.

Super Bowl 55 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be the main event Sunday in Tampa, Florida, but often viewers tune in for the entertainment and commercials as much as the game.

Every year, one of the biggest acts in music takes the country's biggest stage after the first two quarters of the game. This year's halftime performer will be The Weeknd, who will perform for the standard 12-13 minutes. HIs real name is Abel Tesfaye.

The Weeknd, snubbed at the Grammys this year, has three No. 1 albums to his name with several No. 1 singles, including ""Blinding Lights,"" ""The Hills"" and ""Can't Feel My Face."" The Weeknd's co-manager told Billboard that the singer paid $7 million to ""make this halftime show be what he envisioned.""

The Super Bowl halftime show will be televised on CBS, the CBS All Access app and CBSSports.com. The game starts at 6:30 p.m. ET.

Thirty years later, Whitney Houston’s performance of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl remains iconic, the standard by which all other renditions are measured – usually to their detriment.

And it almost didn’t happen.

“We’d gotten the tape of it, and there were people in the league who didn’t think it was appropriate,” said Jim Steeg, who, as the NFL’s longtime senior vice president of special events, was responsible for planning the Super Bowl.

That seems unfathomable now. But you have to remember the circumstances at the time, said Rickey Minor, Houston’s longtime musical director.

The first Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, had begun just 10 days earlier, and tensions were high throughout the country. Some had even questioned the appropriateness of playing the Super Bowl with Americans in harm’s way, but President George H.W. Bush insisted the game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Giants go ahead.

The NFL also was leery of doing anything that might appear disrespectful of American troops or make it seem as if the league were not showing appropriate seriousness for this moment in history. Given Roseanne Barr’s debacle the previous summer, when she had screeched her way through The Star-Spangled Banner before a Major League Baseball game, the NFL was particularly concerned that there be nothing out of the ordinary about Houston’s performance of the national anthem.

There was, however.

When Houston and Minor first talked about the anthem, she mentioned how much she’d loved Marvin Gaye’s performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, a leisurely but luxurious version backed by a drum kit.

“She said, `I love how he took his time. It felt like the words just had another moment to linger, so you would feel this story,’” Minor recalled.

Minor added some jazz and Gospel chords, and gave the finale a “traditional Gospel cadence.” But it was his decision to add an extra beat to each bar, rather than do the anthem at its traditional waltz tempo – imagine counting 3, 2, 1 in your head as you sing – that set it apart.

“That gave her a little time to really pull those notes and hold them out to resonate,” Minor told USA TODAY Sports. “It wasn’t necessarily to change it. It was really to give her what she needed to give the best performance she could.

“My challenge was to make something that would enable her to soar.”

Minor said he could see there would be some resistance when he went to Tampa so The Florida Orchestra could record what he’d arranged.

Sure enough, the NFL, ABC, even Houston’s own father, John, who was her manager -– everyone wanted Houston to sing the anthem the way it had always been done.

“Sometimes, when you’re introduced to something new, you don’t like it or love it. It’s weird,” Minor said. “I think it was more of a shock. `This isn’t what we’re used to.’”

The orchestra was in the midst of recording when Minor said he was told he had a phone call. It was Houston’s father and, under pressure from NFL officials, he wanted Minor to scrap the musical arrangement.

But Minor politely told John Houston that he didn’t work for the orchestra, ABC, the NFL or even him. He worked for Whitney Houston, and this was the version he believed was best for her to do.

John Houston relented, Minor said, though the orchestra did record a traditional version of the anthem “just in case.”

THE MOMENTS: The 55 greatest Super Bowl moments in NFL history

THE TEAMS: The 55 greatest teams to play in the Super Bowl – and not all won Lombardi Trophy

Minor sent Houston the orchestra’s recording, but she still hadn’t listened to it when she arrived to record the “master track,” common for live performances as insurance against weather or equipment glitches. (While Houston did sing live, her microphone was off, and what everyone heard was the recording.)

Theirs wasn’t the kind of relationship where he gave Houston many instructions or told her what to do, Minor said. Instead, he simply played the music for her.

“She listened and she said `OK, I got it,’” Minor said.

Houston was famous for not wanting to do multiple takes – “Let me tell you, it was so annoying!” Minor said with a laugh. But on this day, it truly was all she needed.

“That first take has everything in it,” Minor said. “I said, `Since you’re here, why don’t you do another one?’ I just wanted to hear it again. I just wanted it for me.”

Though Minor said he knew that day that Houston’s rendition of the anthem would be iconic, he said that wasn’t either’s intent. They simply wanted to honor the moment, in the best way Houston could.

In a way only Houston could.

“This kind of thing, all of the stars aligned for this to happen. That’s what happened,” Minor said. “Is it (possible) to make the stars align again and again and again with the same piece of music? I’m not sure. … There’s one version that sticks out. That’s what happens with Whitney. When she gets ahold of something, it stands out. Just because of the way she’s doing it.”

Speaking of stars aligning …

Steeg said Houston was originally supposed to do the national anthem three years earlier, at Super Bowl 22. But they were still in the process of finalizing the contract when her father took over as her manager, Steeg said, and John Houston felt no obligation to honor their previous agreement because he said he didn’t know anything about it.

Besides, John Houston told Steeg, the timing wouldn’t work. Houston was going to be overseas for her “Moment of Truth” world tour.

Herb Alpert would ultimately do the national anthem at Super Bowl 22. (The last instrumental performance of the anthem at the Super Bowl, by the way.)

But had Houston performed in 1988, or had Steeg been one to hold a grudge, she isn’t asked to sing in 1991.

And a seminal American moment would be lost.

“Whitney’s here with us. Not in the physical, but she’s all around everywhere,” Minor said. “And she’s affecting someone’s life. I do believe in your molecular structure being altered just by hearing her voice. I’m grateful to be a part of it and I’m honored to serve.

“I know that Whitney would be, if she were with us today physically, she would be really touched and flattered that this much love is going 30 years later.”

On the day the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookies reported for training camp, a new employee also started her first day.

The hiring went mostly unnoticed aside from a handful of news stories; the Buccaneers actually didn't even issue a press release or publish any content on their official website to announce it.

But on July 27, when she spent her first day as Tampa Bay's director of football research, Jacqueline Davidson became the highest-ranking Black woman across the 32 front offices in the NFL.

Davidson, though, is just one of the women with high-profile roles who helped push the Buccaneers to Super Bowl 55. And as the NFL is expanding efforts to bring more qualified women into the league, Davidson and her colleagues are navigating the balance between being disruptors in a male-dominated industry and achieving results.

""I feel like when I was when I was younger, I probably put too much pressure on myself to do everything perfectly and be this shining example, to not detrimentally impact anyone in the future,"" Davidson told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. ""But that's an insane thing to try to do, because it's impossible. So I do embrace that responsibility, but I no longer carry it like it's a burden. But it always has to be about the work. Always. Because that's the one objective thing that you can leave behind.""

The Buccaneers, who are making their second Super Bowl appearance and will face the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday, have become the paradigm for diversity in the NFL. Coach Bruce Arians has hired a staff where all four coordinators are Black.

Women, who had been a rarity in coaching, are also prominent. Lori Locust is the assistant defensive line coach. Maral Javadifar is the assistant strength and conditioning coach. Together, they are two of the only eight female assistant coaches in the NFL.

Carly Helfand is a scouting assistant. Stephanie Kolloff O’Neill serves as the director of performance nutrition. On the business administration side, five of the organization's nine vice presidents are women: Christi Bedan (digital and media), Kristin Hamwey (human resources), Nikki Donofrio (marketing), Tara Battiato (community impact) and Amy Taylor (group sales).

This effort on inclusion and diversity is something that has trickled down from the highest levels of the organization, with Darcie Glazer Kassewitz serving as one of the team's co-owners.

""To hear voices in a staff meeting that aren't the same, don't look alike, but they all have input — you get better output,"" Arians said this week.

Davidson calls herself ""Southern to the core"" and is an only child born and raised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. She grew up watching Atlanta Braves games with her father and grandfather. Eventually, she played high school basketball. But in Tuscaloosa, it was football that linked the social fabric of the community.

When she was in elementary school, a corporate attorney from a nearby company spoke to her class. That speech was when Davidson decided she wanted to be a lawyer.

Years later, in what she jokingly called a ""sad, but true story,"" it was after she watched the movie Jerry Maguire that she realized she wanted to work in sports.

She graduated from Davidson College in 2002 with an economics degree and three years later earned her law degree from the Cornell University School of Law.

With the Bucs, she's a trusted resource in contract negotiations with extensive experience in contract language and the salary cap. She uses analytics to advise general manager Jason Licht and the rest of the front office on roster management decisions. She also helps scout opponents, trying to reveal tendencies that can help the coaching staff as they craft their game plans.

""She is — as advertised — brilliant,"" Licht said recently.

Davidson first broke into the NFL as a legal intern in 2004 through the league's Management Council. Three years after that, she took her first job with an NFL team, with the New York Jets. She spent eight and a half seasons as the manager of football administration before a promotion to director of football administration.

It was in New York where Davidson met and worked closely with Mike Greenberg, the current Buccaneer director of football administration. She and Greenberg stayed in touch and talked constantly.

Greenberg, who has been with the Buccaneers for 11 seasons, pestered Licht about Davidson, telling him that she was the smartest person he worked with at the Jets. This summer, even though the Tampa Bay front office was basically complete, Licht made his pitch to Davidson.

""One of the things he said that really stuck with me is: 'I just want to get good people in the building, and then we'll figure out where to put them,' "" Davidson said. ""That was essentially what it felt like. Like: 'We're making this for you.' It's hard to say no to that, right? It's it's hard to turn that down.""

Licht pointed to the contracts of running back Leonard Fournette and receiver Antonio Brown, two players whose contributions helped sustain Tampa Bay's playoff run, as some of Davidson's key contributions in her first season.

""I don't know if we would have gotten those done without the work of Jackie and Mike,"" Licht said. ""We hired her because of her resume and what she brings. Hiring her made us a smarter organization immediately.""

The next step for Davidson, Locust, Javadifar and the rest of the women coaching and working in the NFL is for this experience to help them ascend.

NFL senior director of diversity and inclusion Sam Rapoport told USA TODAY that ""there's no question Jackie's in the pipeline and poised to become a general manager in the NFL soon.""

Davidson, like anyone in her position would, hasn't shied away from that eventual goal, to rise to the top of her profession. She stressed, however, that for right now, she's focused on the work.

""I want to win a couple of Super Bowls,"" Davidson said. ""Starting with Sunday.

""But long term? I want to be remembered as someone who contributed to the game in some form or fashion, whether it's for other people behind me or whether it's leaving some kind of indelible mark on the game. What does that look like? I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead. But I feel like you should always want to leave things better than you found them.""

Rapoport helped start the Women's Careers in Football Forum in 2017. It helps women in entry level positions in college football connect with executives who can help advance their careers. This year's forum will take place at the end of February and will be held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective is to flood the market with as many talented and qualified women so that teams will have a crop of candidates to pick from when they're hiring.

""It's inevitable,"" Rapoport said. ""We've already seen women starting at the entry levels, in intern roles, in temporary roles and ascending into roles like chief of staff, or assistant running backs coach. We're already seeing the ascension. With the champions that we have in leadership positions in the NFL right now, this train isn't slowing down.""",Meet some of the women who helped get the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the Super Bowl 55

Like a typical Super Bowl Sunday, chicken wings, pizza and subs will still be in hot demand.

While Americans are still expected to partake in their favorite game-day foods, there will be fewer Super Bowl parties amid the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the National Chicken Council, Americans will eat a record 1.42 billion wings while watching the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This is up 2% from last year.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, is advising people to avoid parties during the pandemic and said big events like Sunday’s game in Tampa, Florida, are a cause for concern over the potential for virus spread.

“You don’t want parties with people that you haven’t had much contact with,” Fauci told NBC’s “Today” show. “You just don’t know if they’re infected, so, as difficult as that is, at least this time around, just lay low and cool it.”

This year's Super Bowl is likely to set new streaming records, with more people watching on their own.

""In the past seven days we have had 15 avalanche fatalities in the US and many close calls that could have resulted in more deaths and serious injuries,"" said Simon Trautman, national avalanche specialist at the center.

It was the deadliest week for avalanche accidents in the US in more than 100 years. In March of 1910, an avalanche in Wellington, Washington, killed 96 people.

On Saturday, police in Salt Lake City responded to a call about an avalanche in Millcreek Canyon that had trapped two groups of skiers. According to the Unified Police Department of Salt Lake City, four skiers were able to dig their way out of the snow, but four others died from the impact. All of them had been well prepared and had the right equipment for conditions, authorities said.

The four survivors were men in their 20s and 30s and did not have any life-threatening injuries, police said. The four skiers who died were identified as Sarah Moughamian, 29, Louis Holian, 26, Stephanie Hopkins, 26, Thomas Louis Steinbrecher, 23.

Timothy Wilks was fatally shot in the parking lot of Urban Air Trampoline and Adventure Park around 9:25 p.m. Friday, according to a Metropolitan Nashville Police Department statement. When officers arrived, 23-year-old David Starnes Jr. admitted that he had shot Wilks, believing himself and others to be in danger.

Starnes told police that he didn't know about any prank. No arrests have been made, and police said they're investigating whether Starnes acted in self-defense.

Robbery pranks remain popular on YouTube, with some videos getting millions of views.

Phoebe Bridgers was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live this weekend. At the end of her performance of ""I Know the End,"" she smashed her guitar. And it was beautiful and cathartic. Bridgers' salute to ~rock 'n' roll~ instantly became a meme. First, because her guitar put up a good fight trying not to get smashed.

""I mean, I didn't care much for the song either, but that seemed extra,"" user BrooklynDad_Defiant! said. People on Twitter responded swiftly and came to Bridgers' defense. Many people pointed out that the guitar smash has been venerated as a rock 'n' roll tradition for decades — when male musicians do it, anyway.

But saving enough money to make a down payment can take a long time — and that's just the beginning of the costs of homeownership.

You'll also need money for closing costs and a home inspection. Oh, and don't forget about saving another chunk of cash for any repairs. This increases the amount you'll need to save up front.

Plus, in some cities, buying a home can cost you significantly more than renting thanks to property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, and utility bills. Going on Zillow and searching for homes for sale can help you figure out if this is the case near you. When searching homes for sale, scroll down to the ""monthly cost"" breakdown to get an idea of what it could cost you per month if you buy (you can even put in numbers that more closely match your circumstances).

AND on top of all that, you'll also need to consider whether or not owning property is the right lifestyle decision for you. Maybe you don't have the time or energy to maintain a backyard. Or maybe a home in the suburbs might allow you to escape exorbitant rent prices...but you'll also end up spending a ton of money on commuting.

TL;DR: You don't have to be in a rush to buy a home. If renting is the most economical decision for you right now, don't let anyone — your parents, a financial advisor, etc. — guilt you for it. Renting until you're really ready to buy can save you from burning cash you don't have.",10 Old Money Rules That Just Aren't True Anymore

""The bride chose and purchased the bridesmaid dresses a year before the wedding. We gave our sizes, but when we went to try them on 10 months later only one of the dresses fit. The maid of honor was heavily pregnant, one bridesmaid had lost a lot of weight and myself and another had gained weight. The bride found this seamstress who could alter the dresses, but she refused to even consider doing anything about the two dresses that were too small. The seamstress basically called us both fat and said we were bad friends for gaining weight. I was told I needed to lose at least 20 pounds in about four weeks and the bride nodded in agreement. The night before the next dress fitting the bride texted me saying if the dress didn't fit I would be out of the wedding. In the end, the dress fit with room to spare and I was in the wedding, but it wasn't fun. By the way, two years later when I got married the bride was supposed to be my maid of honor.

I ordered two rolls thinking that if I liked it in my kitchen, I’d order more to use on the wall behind my bar cart. I loved it so much when it came in that I decided to go ahead and put it up on the big wall and deal with the kitchen later. The pattern is so easy to line up and it looks so good! My tiny, dark apartment instantly looked bigger and brighter. Even up close I can’t tell where the seams are.

With the circle parts on both ends, they even play with it, and sometimes they use it as a lounge chair. It's good for cats to have scratching posts that are both vertical and horizontal so they can stretch all their muscles (and don't end up ripping up your carpet or furniture). I've had it for a year now with both cats using it daily and it has not worn out yet. Once one side is worn out, you just turn it upside down and there's another brand new side for them to use — so it's like you're getting two posts for the price of one.

He was charged with aggravated sexual assault against a minor over an incident that allegedly took place in July 2020, the Dallas County Sheriff's Department told BuzzFeed News.

Robert Joseph Scianna Jr., 25, and Mitchell Ryan, 23, two cheerleaders who appeared in the Netflix docuseries Cheer , have separately been charged with alleged offenses relating to sexual misconduct with minors this week.

His lawyer, Jeremy Rosenthal, did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment, but Rosenthal told USA Today, ""This has been a nightmare for Mitch and his family. We look forward to Dallas County hearing the truth and this case being over.""

Ryan posted bond Friday morning and was released, the Sheriff's Department said.

Scianna, whose website says that he is an NCA champion and a two-time world champion, was arrested Wednesday by Chesterfield County police in Virginia, USA Today reported.

He has been charged with indecent liberties with a minor and using a communication system to solicit sex, a spokesperson for the Chesterfield County Jail confirmed to BuzzFeed News.

Police said that Scianna arranged a meeting to have sex with a juvenile he'd met on social media, USA Today reported.

Scianna did not respond to a request for comment.

The US All Star Federation (USASF), a network of youth athletes in cheerleading, said in a statement Friday that it is ""outraged by the reports of sexual misconduct.""

The organization also said that it did not know about the allegations of sexual misconduct against Scianna prior to his arrest.

The USASF, however, said that it became aware of the allegations against Ryan after receiving a complaint in late October and ""immediately ensured that it had been reported to law enforcement and later began an investigation of [its] own, which was ongoing when he was arrested.""

The organization told BuzzFeed News that Scianna and Ryan have been placed on the ""Unified Ineligibility List.""



The charges against the two cheerleaders involved in the Netflix docuseries come after Jerry Harris, a star of the show, was hit with additional child pornography charges in December.

Harris had been arrested in September on suspicion of producing child pornography, and prosecutors later alleged in a pretrial detention hearing that he may have victimized at least 10 boys.

In a statement to ABC News at the time of his arrest, a spokesperson for Harris said that they ""categorically dispute"" the allegations against him. However, the initial criminal complaint filed against him stated that he admitted to investigators that he had sex with a minor at a cheer competition in 2019.","Two Cheerleaders In Netflix's ""Cheer"" Have Been Charged With Sex Crimes Involving Minors"

"['Jason Leopold', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter', 'Anthony Cormier']",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/cia-torture-briefing-president-biden?origin=web-hf,[],"Intelligence officials praise Morgan Muir and his record, but a former Senate investigator said Muir cannot be trusted to “convey accurate information.”",[''],en,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,,set(),"“I would not trust him,” Jones said. Given Muir’s past statements, he said, “there’s no room for you in senior positions anymore.”

Jones told BuzzFeed News he believes Muir’s statements to the committee should immediately disqualify him from his new role because he cannot be trusted to “convey accurate information.”

After questions from BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for the Office of Director of National Intelligence said Muir is no longer expected to brief Biden personally.

Though the committee’s politically explosive 6,700-page report on the subject was based on the CIA’s own documents, Daniel Jones, the lead author, said Muir continued to defend the value of the torture program, citing information that the CIA would later publicly admit was inaccurate .

In 2013, during a dramatic standoff between the Senate Intelligence Committee and the CIA, Morgan Muir, then a senior CIA analyst, played a pivotal role that has never before been reported. After the senate committee found that “enhanced interrogation techniques” against terror suspects were not effective, he led a series of tense meetings in which the CIA attacked those findings.

The man overseeing President Joe Biden's daily intelligence briefing previously advocated for the CIA’s false claims about its torture program to a powerful Senate committee, according to its former lead investigator and three others with direct knowledge of the events.

Muir did not respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News. CIA spokesperson Timothy Barrett called Jones’ characterizations “baseless” and Muir “an exemplary career intelligence officer whose strength of character is unquestionable.”

But former Democratic senator Mark Udall, who was a particularly outspoken member of the Intelligence Committee, expressed caution. “President Biden has assembled a strong national security team, but he should have serious concerns about entrusting his Presidential Daily Briefing to anyone who may have helped cover up this dark chapter in our nation's history,” Udall said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.

In addition, he said: “I can attest that it's critical that intelligence agencies provide the president and other leaders with unbiased, factual and honest information. As we now know, the CIA and its leadership misled the public, senators, and Senate staff for years about the CIA's systematic and brutal torture of detainees.”

As first reported in the New York Times, Muir was initially tapped to meet with Biden for the President’s Daily Brief, a highly classified summary of national security threats around the world.

After BuzzFeed News contacted ODNI for comment, spokesperson Amanda Schoch said Wednesday that Muir’s responsibilities would not include being in the Oval Office “on a daily basis briefing the President.”

On Friday she seemed to rule out presidential briefings altogether. “He is not the President’s briefer as that term is generally understood, and there are no plans for him to be in the oval,” said Schoch.

His new role is to be in charge of mission integration, which means he will be responsible for coordinating intelligence collection and analysis across multiple agencies. That includes overseeing the contents of the President’s Daily Brief, which she said will probably be delivered by “a series of expert briefers.” She gave no explanation for the change.

In response to questions about Muir’s role defending the torture program, she said, “Morgan Muir is a widely respected intelligence officer who has demonstrated the highest standards of integrity and professionalism throughout his career.”

The White House declined to comment.

The 2013 meetings with the Senate Intelligence Committee took place in a highly charged political climate, after the committee had completed — though not yet published — its report and the CIA had offered its formal response. Muir, who had previously provided the Daily Brief to President George W. Bush, was chosen to lead the CIA’s delegation in a series of discussions with committee members and staffers.

The daylong meetings, which continued over the course of months, took place inside the secure facility at the Hart Senate Office Building, where classified information is discussed. Jones and another source said the meetings were recorded and the tapes are in the committee's vault.

The two sides’ perspectives were so far apart, it sometimes seemed impossible to reconcile even basic facts. “We would say, ‘Here’s a piece of paper. It is red. We can all see that it is red,’” Jones said. “And they would say, ‘No, it’s blue.’ ”

Three sources knowledgeable about the interactions corroborated Jones’ account. Jones, who now leads a private research and investigative firm, said Muir defended the CIA’s response to the torture report — even after he was shown copies of the agency’s own records contradicting its claims.

“He continued to double down on the false assertions,” Jones said.

For instance, the CIA claimed a success in Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, who the agency said gave up information about another terror operative after being subjected to waterboarding. President Bush would also cite that case when he revealed the existence of the CIA’s interrogation program in 2006. But by the time Mohammed was waterboarded, the CIA had already obtained the information through another operation, without the use of torture.

When the Senate torture report and the CIA's response was released, the CIA also quietly posted three pages of corrections to its response, including the fact that Bush was given inaccurate information about Mohammed. It would be a year before the Senate Intelligence Committee and the public even learned of the existence of the corrections.

Eventually the meetings — dramatized in the movie The Report, about Jones’ investigation into the CIA’s torture program and the yearslong effort to release a public version of the report — broke down altogether. In March 2014, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s chairperson, accused the CIA of spying on her committee, intimidating her staffers, and attempting to block the release of the torture report.

Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee then and now, did not respond directly to questions about Muir. But in a statement to BuzzFeed News, he said, “The American people deserve transparency about the backgrounds of high-level intelligence officials who, besides directly briefing the President, work for the public.”",Official Overseeing Biden Briefings Helped CIA Defend Torture

Joseph Rodríguez Rampart officers search an abandoned motel for a murder suspect in Los Angeles, 1994. The building is just a few blocks from Charlie Chaplin’s old mansion.

In 1994, photographer Joseph Rodríguez was given unprecedented access to cover the Los Angeles police for two weeks for the New York Times. This was three years after the beating of Rodney King was recorded on video and two years after the riots broke out over the acquittal of the four officers involved, prompting a reckoning over use of force that is as familiar as it is unresolved today. Rodríguez, a well-known documentary photographer who grew up in Brooklyn and who is no stranger to the criminal justice system, was sent to document a police force that was trying to overhaul its image within the community. The unit he embedded with, named the “Rampart Division,” is now notorious for a corruption scandal that broke a few years later. At the time, Rodríguez watched and documented cops on responding to shootings and domestic violence calls, pulling guns on gang members, and patrolling neighborhoods day in and day out. In an age when a lot of interactions with the police are captured on cellphone videos and shared on social media, it is striking to see images that document the complex role of officers both on and off duty. The photos by Rodríguez highlight the questions that we are still grappling with today about justice, force, racism, and who gets to enact violence against whom. Although they were taken over two decades ago, the photos offer insight into how the police see themselves, a crucial thing to understand as we reckon with who we are as a society. Rodríguez has turned the work into a new book, LAPD 1994. The photographs are also part of an online exhibition at the Bronx Documentary Center. He spoke with BuzzFeed News about his complicated feelings about cops and how a social documentary can help shift narratives.

How did this assignment start?

When this project came up, I was coming off of two years of really deep investigative work on LA gangs. I was really burned out, but one thing I’ve learned from Gilles Peress, the Magnum war photographer, is that whenever you get access you must take it. I knew that this was a one-shot deal. We were about to walk into a police precinct (that turned out to be wildly corrupt), but they gave me access, let me drive around with them for a couple of weeks. It was strange to be sitting in the backseat of a police car, but this time with a camera. I knew what I was looking at and just had to keep my eyes open. I knew this wasn’t going to last, so I just didn't sleep for two weeks, basically. What has been the reaction you’ve received to showing police work with compassion? I believe that there are a lot of good cops out here. There really are. I understand the criminal justice system and how it works. There are good people and there are bad people, but I was very mindful of this blue shield of silence. Was I trying to make them look good? No, I'm just a humanist. So I photograph the person in front of me, and that's it. The number one crime in this country really is domestic violence. And they see this every day, and it jades you. Let’s not be naive though — Rampart [Division] was really corrupt. It was one of the most corrupt police divisions, and I only found this out after a story was published and the FBI went in there and whatever. At the time, you had two of the most powerful gangs in Los Angeles, MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. I had photographed some of those guys, so I knew how serious these guys were. This crash unit that I drove around with, their main job was to get the guns off the street. In a way, LAPD was like another gang. They would do things and keep things kind of quiet. The history is there in the book, and there will be an open discussion at the BDC. That will be interesting, how people read these pictures and what they mean.

How do you feel about policing now? I’ve seen things get more tense after we militarized the police. What I saw on the ground, the militarization of the police after 9/11 — just an amazing amount of money came in. There’s been buildup from Reagan, Clinton, and all of a sudden there's this barrage of police that come in like the Avengers. They don’t even talk to anyone, just grab everybody, grab the guns. In your mind, what is the ideal role of a police officer? You see a little bit of it in LAPD 1994. There was Officer Llanes. They were on patrol one night, and they came across this woman. She's crying and screaming in a phone booth, and they come out. There's no guns or anything. It's a very different kind of picture. They see her every other day, and that’s community policing. They talk to her and try to get her off the streets. In another picture, you barely see Llanes in the frame. It's a big, wide picture, and you have the father and the little kid, and it’s a domestic violence call, and he’s trying to calm things down. That's what I remember policing to be like in the ’60s and the ’70s. You had the regular officers who worked the same neighborhoods for 20 years, so they got to know the pizza place, they got to know the high school kids. So it was more of a conversation. Today it's very little conversation, and there is the latent issue of “Where do the police stand on their own race issues?” If you do the job day in, day out of these neighborhoods, I mean, whew. The guys were saying that they had more divorces than any other division. It's a tough job to do. But I’m not here to make you look good. I'm just here to show truth, show the moments. Even with my own subjective feelings and issues with the police, I kept that separate because that's the job. I'm not an activist. I’m not going in there to make you look bad either.

Joseph Rodríguez Officer Dona holds a baby from the community while on patrol, Los Angeles, 1994.

I loved that one moment where there's a new baby in the neighborhood and the officer in the car is like, Oh hey, look, there's our new baby. That's the old way. He was no angel either, but it was nice to see that humanity. I want to make it clear — one of the things that drew me, every night, was the sheer sense of gun violence. It was like, we’d be walking down the street, 2 p.m., and there’d be some knuckleheads with a bunch of shotguns, AK-47s, shooting it out. It was really like that. I got very tired. I spent six months in therapy after this and East Side Stories [another book by Rodríguez]. PTSD is a funny thing; it builds up on you and it hits you like a ton of bricks. What is your favorite image from this work? I like the first picture of the police officer getting his shoes shined. There's something about that image, with the sign on the wall, “everyone here brings happiness.” Oh man, c’mon, are you serious? And you look at the face of the shoeshine guy coming in. It's just — with all the black polish coming off the box there, it represents, for me, a lot of our history. Who’s at the top, who’s doing service. This other image that I really liked was the two detectives, the close-up, because it's so different: policing in LA versus in New York. In LA, they wear Armani suits. They’re really into that look. In New York, they wear polyester. I thought that was kind of interesting. This is not that kind of book that makes you feel good or gives you that sense of warmth. It is a document about its particular time and what was happening. One of the other pictures that I think is almost surreal to me is the gun in the grass after this guy has just been shot. That's the evidence right there. That is America's problem right there. Do you have any advice for aspiring photographers? Getting access is 90% of the game. Getting that person on the other side of the phone. I know what it's like to be on the bottom. I know what it's like to be in trouble. I know what it's like to be in an angry space. I use my photography to bring some hope to something. I wouldn’t say that this is a very hopeful book, but that's OK. You can see it in my Taxi book, which is a very different book of New York at the time. I’m a social realism guy. I grew up with this social documentary practice, “Where’s the problem? What’s the problem? Let's try to make some corrections.” I believe in looking backwards at times to make sense of today.

Promising review: ""When I first caught wind of the Bartesian premium cocktail machine ($349.99 on Amazon), my first thought was does anyone actually need this gadget? But after trying it for myself, I can say the answer is a firm YES, and here's why. I love making cocktails at home, and while I'm no bartender, I feel very comfortable shaking a spicy margarita, stirring a negroni, or whipping up a Pisco sour. But making craft cocktails at home requires many (often expensive) ingredients, bar tools, time and effort. With the Bartesian though, you can make fancy drinks with the click of a button — literally. Once you turn the Bartesian on, it prompts you to insert a cocktail capsule. The smart gadget recognizes the cocktail you're trying to make and will ensure you've placed the proper spirit in the bottle (I know, it's mind-blowing). Next, it prompts you to choose your cocktail strength (there's even a mocktail option), and to place a glass with ice underneath the spout. Next, the Bartesian will start pouring your craft cocktail. The whole process takes about 20 seconds and it's all very exciting. With many bars closed and people quarantining or feeling hesitant about going out to eat, this gadget allows you to make professional-quality cocktails at home."" —Hannah Loewentheil

This air fryer has made my life so much simpler and has eliminated all of that! My frozen sweet potato fries now only take 15 minutes to cook, I can keep the fryer in my office, and after about five uses, I can say it cooks very well and gives my fries (and tots) a delicious, crispy, fried taste.

The officer then shot him in the chest, witnesses said, and he died at the scene.

Mr. Valdivia, in a hastily called news conference by the destroyed municipal building, placed responsibility on the police for the shooting, saying the officer and his partner had not followed protocol in a routine ID check. Witnesses also faulted them for not trying to help Mr. Martínez as he lay dying. A nurse standing near the shooting was the first to assist him until an ambulance arrived.

The mayor also blamed the police for the fires, saying they had “entrenched themselves” in their own quarters and left other government buildings unprotected.

“This is a simple issue of public information and who has access to it and why,” Mr. Ton-That told The Times, adding that he was keen to take the privacy commissioners to court.

Currently the privacy commissioners have no power to fine or reprimand the company, but a bill before Parliament to update data privacy laws would allow the federal commissioner to impose fines of 25 million Canadian dollars or 5 percent of a company’s gross revenue.

“That social activism period at the friendship center taught me that if you want to effect some change, you better be willing to involve somebody at the political level or have some political power,” he said. “And so I thought becoming a politician would be the answer.”

Law school, he said, seemed the most obvious way into politics.

Mr. Sinclair practiced criminal and civil law mainly for Indigenous clients, an often dispiriting experience. “Sometimes you have to play by those kinds of rules that make you feel a little sick to your stomach,” he said.

But one of Mr. Merrick’s observations in the tepee renewed Mr. Sinclair’s commitment.

“If you go and become a carpenter, you’ll always be a carpenter who knows the law, and people will always come to you and ask you questions,” Mr. Sinclair recalled being told. “It’s not like you can turn your back on your knowledge.”

He stuck with it.

In 1988, Mr. Sinclair was approached about becoming Manitoba’s first Indigenous judge. He hesitated, knowing he would be part of a system that disproportionately jailed Indigenous people. But several Indigenous leaders persuaded Mr. Sinclair that it would be valuable to have him on the bench.

Not long after, Mr. Sinclair was tapped to help lead an Aboriginal justice inquiry in Manitoba, a sometimes harrowing experience that included the suicide of a senior police officer who had been called to testify. Later, Mr. Sinclair would lead an emotionally charged inquiry into the deaths of 12 children during surgery that brought reforms to Canada’s medical system.","He Almost Quit the Law.

His gray hair, normally coifed in a lion’s mane, was tied back in a messy bun. He wore a face mask and jail-issued gray-blue shirt, and sat staring straight ahead, offering no visible reaction to the judge’s decision.

It is relatively rare in Canada to be denied bail, particularly for people with no criminal record like Mr. Nygard, said Seth Weinstein, a criminal defense lawyer in Toronto who co-authored a book on extradition cases.

Mr. Prober said he would wait for more information from the American prosecutors regarding the charges before deciding his client’s next steps. It is very unlikely a challenge by Mr. Nygard to his extradition would be successful, experts said.

“In Canada, it is nearly impossible not to be extradited, especially to our good friends, the U.S.,” said Robert Currie, a professor of international criminal law at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He added that wealthy people who exhaust all legal means might stave off extradition for a couple of years.

In Canada, the bail system is largely predicated on community trust and connections and does not involve large cash deposits and commercial bail bondmen, as it does in many U.S. states.

Instead, in most cases, the accused is required to find one or more “sureties” — usually a family member or lifelong friend who pledges collateral, often in the form of property. More importantly, they also agree to oversee the accused, ensuring that the defendant follows the bail terms laid out by the court, and to alert the police of any transgressions.

In Mr. Nygard’s case, none of his 10 children, past girlfriends or longstanding business executives who helped build his company showed up in court as proposed sureties. Instead, it was two employees: one a former construction manager with a criminal record for cocaine trafficking and a previous association with the Hells Angels motorcycle club, and the other a former director who still works for Mr. Nygard overseeing the company’s bankruptcy procedure.",Fashion Mogul Peter Nygard Denied Bail by Canadian Judge

To take advantage of a happiness reset, begin with a simpler trip — a beach getaway close to home, a cross-country road trip, a fishing expedition with friends. No need for an extravagant getaway on the other side of the world. Even low-key trips are likely to feel novel after the pandemic. Dr. Dunn, for example, said she is planning a vacation with friends to a ranch in her home province of British Columbia when vacation travel there is allowed again.

“The happiness reset won’t last forever,” she said. “We’ll ramp up our expectations again. You might as well take advantage of this moment.”

How to cultivate anticipation

Ideally, you want to book a vacation far enough in advance that you have time beforehand to gather details about the destination, to build excitement and positive expectations. This is as true for a trip to a state park as it is for a trip to Sicily. Since you don’t know what will happen on a hike, an escape to distant coastal cliffs or an Italian getaway you can use the time beforehand to fantasize, to imagine the Mediterranean Sea, food and sunshine. It’s through this cultivation of anticipation that the pleasure of a vacation can be extended beyond the trip itself.

When you don’t give yourself enough time to actively anticipate a vacation — to pore over photographs of places you plan to see, read about history, browse things to do (you can discover more ways to cultivate anticipation for travel here) — you miss out on a potent source of pleasure. As the authors of investigations that examined people’s anticipation of, experiences in and recollections of, meaningful life events (including a trip to Europe, a Thanksgiving vacation and bicycling in California) wrote in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology: “people’s expectations of personal events are more positive than their actual experience during the event itself.”",Travel and the Art of Anticipation

First, Hurricane Eta, then just two weeks later, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the season, Iota. The Indigenous Miskito village of Haulover suffered a direct hit. When the skies cleared, the coastline had been transformed. Where once there was a verdant coconut grove, the ocean now cut through the center of town, connecting to a lagoon. Nicaragua has seen storms before, but never like this. As climate change intensifies, hurricanes are becoming more destructive, and these coastal communities are bearing the brunt. Now people here are facing a new dilemma. Should they rebuild in the only area they’ve ever known, or should they seek refuge inland, away from the sea? One person advising displaced residents is Marcos Williamson, an environmental scientist at the Regional Autonomous University in Puerto Cabezas. He’s sending a team of researchers to Haulover to assess storm damage and to determine if it’s even a viable place for people to live anymore. 2020 tied for the hottest year on record for the planet. And it was the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic. When the team sets out, it finds Nicaragua’s vast old mangrove forests battered and broken … … along with wildlife that appear to be disoriented or hurt. Donald Williams, a marine biologist, says that local fish and wildlife need mangroves to survive. If these mangroves don’t recover, then the fish, Haulover’s key source of food and livelihood, may not either. Now all the rotting material and saltwater have upset the lagoon’s ecological balance, and they’re endangering the freshwater fish. Gone, too, are the coconut trees and a dietary staple. Lorenzo Castro is a community leader, whose family has lived in the region for generations. Castro and other leaders have identified a tract of land suitable for resettlement, located a few miles inland along the canal. And having surveyed the damage, researchers agree that moving inland is the safe course of action. But moving inland, while safer from hurricanes, comes with a price. It would mean abandoning a cultural way of life by the sea and taking up farming. That’s a change many aren’t ready to make, not yet. While scientists and community leaders can advise, in the end, it’s up to the residents to decide where, or if, they want to go. For now, most are surviving with donated food and fishing supplies, hoping for government assistance, and building temporary shacks where their houses once stood. A number of families, about 60 of the 300 or so, have already decided to move to the safer inland location. In the meantime, everyone is salvaging what they can of their former lives. “One, two, three.”",Rebuild or Leave ‘Paradise’: Climate Change Dilemma Facing a Nicaraguan Coastal Town

McCord Jr., a security coordinator for the Nixon campaign whose confession to the judge just before his sentencing precipitated the revelations of White House crimes and cover-ups that culminated in Nixon’s resignation in 1974. For aiding prosecutors in pursuing senior presidential aides in the scandal, Mr. McCord had his one-to-five-year sentence cut to less than four months.

In 1977, the four Cuban-born burglars each accepted an out-of-court settlement of $50,000 from the Nixon campaign. They said they had been misled into believing that they had acted with government sanction on behalf of a White House administration that was concerned about American security and sympathetic to Cuban refugees.

In 1983, after his requests for clemency had been rejected by Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, Mr. Martínez — who, it turned out, had still been on retainer to the C.I.A. at the time of the Watergate break-in — was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan.

The pardon, which was granted because Mr. Martínez had been regarded as the least culpable of the defendants, restored his right to vote. Despite the ordeal, he prided himself on one Watergate keepsake — a golden lucky clover inscribed, in Spanish, with the words “Good luck, Richard Nixon.”

Eugenio Rolando Martínez Careaga was born on July 7, 1922, in what is now the province of Artemisa in western Cuba. Before Castro’s rise he was exiled as a critic of the dictator Fulgencio Batista. He later returned to Cuba but left again in 1959 for opposing Castro’s newly installed regime.

“My mother and father were not allowed to leave Cuba,” he wrote in a reminiscence published in Vanity Fair. “It would have been easy for me to get them out. That was my specialty. But my bosses in the Company — the C.I.A. — said I might get caught and tortured, and if I talked I might jeopardize other operations. So my mother and father died in Cuba. That is how orders go. I follow the orders.”

“By abandoning common-sense asylum policies and increasing the burden on our strained social safety net, these orders will take away jobs from Americans struggling to find employment,” said Jessica Anderson, the executive director of Heritage Action.

But the orders do little more in the short term than order government evaluations. Two of them order a review of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies that limited asylum, stopped funding to foreign countries, made it more difficult to get green cards or be naturalized, and slowed down legal immigration into the United States. The third establishes a task force, headed by Mr. Mayorkas, to identify families separated at the border.

For the most part, the orders do not immediately reverse Mr. Trump’s policies. One order did direct the homeland security secretary to “promptly cease” two programs established last year that put migrants on a fast track to deportation.

Mr. Biden also ordered the State Department to consider suspending accords that allow the United States to rapidly deport migrants at the southwestern border to Central America to seek protection. Those deals with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras would be replaced with more “cooperative” agreements, according to the order.

The reviews and the task force could ultimately open new channels of legal immigration, expand the chance that migrants fleeing violence can win asylum, end the Trump program that forces migrants to wait in Mexico and fully repair the damage done by Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy that led to family separations at the border.

But Mr. Biden’s top spokeswoman said Tuesday that it will take time.

“Part of our effort,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, “is to assess the damage that’s been done by the policies that were put in place by the prior administration.

Administration officials, describing the move as a first step toward addressing racial inequality through policies designed to address climate change, said they planned to ease the limits that the Trump administration placed on another $4.9 billion in aid on the morning of Jan. 20, a few hours before the former president left office.

Puerto Rico’s reconstruction after Maria, which devastated the island more than three years ago, has been far slower than the recovery in other parts of the country, such as Texas and Florida, that were also struck by major disasters that year. That is partly because the Department of Housing and Urban Development had placed restrictions on Puerto Rico’s aid funds that didn’t apply to other recipients, according to current and former officials and policy experts.

In Britain, antigen tests used in a mass testing campaign identified just two-fifths of the coronavirus cases detected by P.C.R. tests.

For that reason, many experts in Canada and elsewhere initially argued it was wiser to expand P.C.R. testing. But, as the pandemic stretched on and the country failed to reach its testing targets, that thinking has changed, said Dr. Irfan Dhalla, co-chairman of the Canadian advisory panel on testing and screening for Covid-19, which recommended the country increase the use of rapid tests.

“A rapid antigen test is clearly better than no test at all, as long as it is not used as a free pass,” Dr. Dhalla said. “Whether it’s a workplace or a school, you still have to wear a mask and you still have to physically distance as much as you can.”

Consortium members hope in the long run that the testing program will help reduce infection rates enough to permit a return to crowded restaurants and boardroom meetings.

The singer and rapper released the song in collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion and it quickly became one of the summer’s biggest hits. However, given the graphic and adult nature of the song, it also faced criticism that the star now says was mostly front he right.

Speaking with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, the 28-year-old explained that she was surprised that people reacted so much to the song, arguing that she grew up listening to ""nasty"" and ""freaky"" music all her life.

Cardi B was previously a vocal supporter of prominent Democrats in the 2020 election, first throwing her weight behind Bernie Sanders before pivoting over to Joe Biden once he became the presumptive nominee.

""I used to endorse Bernie [Sanders] and then Joe Biden, so they were just trying to figure a way out to pick on me,"" she said. ""Like, 'Oh Joe Biden is this the girl you were doing that interview with? The girl that's talking about WAP? That's what you want America to be influenced by?'""

""The people that the song bothers are usually conservatives or really religious people, but my thing is I grew up listening to this type of music,"" Cardi explained at the time (via People). ""Other people might think it's strange and vulgar, but to me, it's almost like really normal, you know what I'm saying?""

A “vote-a-rama” is exactly what it sounds like.,[''],en,,https://www.foxbusiness.com,,set(),"Republicans are insisting that Democrats craft a narrow, targeted COVID relief bill. GOPers grouse that the upcoming plan will reach too far afield and be too costly. And, they want to have a say in the bill.

Continue Reading Below

Democrats recently prepped a budget measure to help them tackle the sixth round of coronavirus legislation. But many Republican amendments to that budget framework had little if anything to deal with public health or economic recovery.

The Senate conducted an 15-hour “vote-a-rama” on the budget Thursday that bled into the wee hours of Friday morning. A “vote-a-rama” is exactly what it sounds like. When considering a budget resolution, the Senate often conducts a series of votes, one after another, for hours on end. In 2008, the Senate voted on 44 amendments. Last week the Senate conducted “only” 41 roll call votes. But Senators ultimately prepared an eye-popping 889 amendments for this exercise.

BUDGET RECONCILIATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT PROCESS USED IN COVID AID FIGHT

It’s easier to keep track of the new variants of coronavirus than amendments in a Senate vote-a-rama.

The amendments covered the political and policy spectrum. Many proposals were nowhere near the same galaxy as addressing the pandemic or the economy.

Consider some of the amendments:

Requiring a photo ID to vote in federal elections. Barring the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. Halting funding to universities that violate the First Amendment. Preservation of the southern border wall. Backing relations between Israel and other nations. Export controls for Huawei. Promoting women in the trucking industry. Opposition to government-run health care. Support for the U.S. Coast Guard in the Arctic. Something called “Roads Instead of the Green New Deal in Peru.” Evaluating the Anglophone crisis in Cameroon.

You get the idea.

The budget process is the congressional equivalent of GameStop. Everyone gets revved up about budgets. But there’s not much value to it.

Congressional “budgets” aren’t binding. So, both sides engineer a host of amendments, weaponized to get their political adversaries on the record on challenging issues. These are the “gotcha” votes the parties deploy come election time.

EXCLUSIVE: HERE'S CONGRESS' ANTICIPATED TIMETABLE FOR THE NEXT CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE

That said, the vote-a-rama provides insight into where members stand on important subjects of the day.

Perhaps one of the most revealing proposals was a plan barring an increase in the minimum wage during the pandemic authored by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. The Senate approved the idea via voice vote. That’s where senators aren’t recorded. They simply shout yea or nay in the chamber and the loudest side wins.

Democrats have long pushed for an increase in the minimum wage – maybe even attaching a new national wage standard to the COVID bill. But that’s not in the cards now. The vote on the Ernst amendment also revealed reality. It showed just how tough approving a higher minimum wage can be – despite Democratic promises to their base.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., also teamed up with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to craft an amendment that targets direct stimulus checks for middle- and low-income earners. The Senate approved that bipartisan proposal.

But bipartisanship on COVID assistance may just be a mirage.

Democrats had ulterior motives to tackling a budget resolution. A budget plan could allow them to go it alone on their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Approving the budget measure permits Democrats to extinguish filibusters on this bill only, via a special parliamentary gambit known as budget reconciliation.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

“It is a reconciliation bill, which means we can pass it with 51 votes in the Senate,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “It would be my honor that we don’t have to use it as a reconciliation bill – that we will be able to have bipartisanship.”

Republicans view that as lip service.

“We’d like to be invited to the table,” said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan.

Still Democrats bragged about bipartisanship during the nocturnal voting spree.

“Many bipartisan amendments were adopted. So this was a bipartisan activity,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “In fact, the first amendment which will help the restaurants was done by Sens. (Kyrsten) Sinema, D-Ariz., and (Roger) Wicker, R-Miss.""

But it was Schumer himself who nullified bipartisanship.

There may have been 889 amendments in play for the budget resolution. Senators may have taken 41 roll call votes on amendments. But the only amendment that mattered was the last one, offered by Schumer.

Per custom, the Senate majority leader often finishes legislation with what’s called a “substitute” amendment. Amendments about the border wall and female truckers and Peru? Those are all just garden variety amendments. But a “substitute” amendment is just that. A switcho-chango. A substitute amendment rips out everything that’s in the bill and inserts brand-new legislative text.

The contents of the budget resolution morphed organically during the vote-a-rama. The Senate accepting some amendments. Rejecting others. But the substitute altered everything at once. And just before the sun rose Friday morning, the Senate adopted Schumer’s bigfoot amendment. Vice President Harris was in the chair, breaking a partisan tie. It was Harris’ first vote breaking a tie as vice president. Democrats voted in lockstep to accept Schumer’s substitute amendment, erasing 15 hours of work.

This is ironic. During an appearance on Fox, Manchin touted the virtues of working across the aisle on the COVID measure.

“We’re going to make this work in a bipartisan way. My friends on the other side are going to have input. We’re going to do something that we can agree on. I’m not just going to do it just down the lines of saying (it’s) a party-line vote,” said Manchin to ""Special Report"" host Bret Baier.

But Manchin’s vote on the substitute amendment shattered his own direct payment plan, forged with Collins.

At 5:35 a.m. Friday, Harris cast her second tie-breaking vote. This was on the actual budget resolution itself. The Senate then shipped the package to the House. The House voted midday Friday to align with the Senate. With the House and Senate in agreement, lawmakers could then begin to prep a budget reconciliation package that would carry the actual coronavirus relief measure.

No budget, no budget reconciliation process is available. But with budget reconciliation, Democrats can ignore a filibuster and pass the bill the way they want.

Last week the local Republican Party in the state's largest conservative county reportedly voted to help other counties in their bid to censure Sasse, 48, a Nebraska native who has served in the Senate since 2015.

Sarpy County Republicans voted 2-1 Thursday to join Scotts Bluff and Hitchcock counties to officially condemn Sasse for attacking Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to overturn the election results and for claiming Trump helped incite the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, the Omaha World-Herald reported.

Anthony said he and other Nebraska Republicans believe Sasse opportunistically supported the then-president until Sasse won his Senate primary, then the senator went back to criticizing Trump.

SUPER BOWL ADS AIM TO COMFORT AND CONNECT

Jostens, which has made 36 of the 54 rings for the Super Bowl, will be manufacturing the team ring for either the Kansas City Chiefs or Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

""Our goal is to tell the story of the team, the season, and the franchise in the most unique way that we can,"" Chris Poitras, Jostens' vice president and general manager of the company's college and professional sports division, told FOX Business.

The NFL traditionally covers the cost of roughly 150 rings for the championship team, which are rewarded to players, coaches, executives and others at the winning team’s discretion. Josten's previously told FOX Business that each set of Super Bowl rings is valued at roughly $5 million, though the team’s preferred design as well as how many times the team has won factor into the final cost.

SUPER BOWL LV OUTCOME COULD BE INFLUENCED BY WEATHER, JOE NAMATH SAYS

While Poitras acknowledged the challenge of trying to top what has been done previously, he noted the Jostens team is ready for the challenge of ""trying to do something that's never been done before.""

According to Poitras, every ring contains gold, diamonds, genuine sapphires and genuine rubies, and the National Football League gives Jostens a monetary allotment based on the current market value of the materials. Generally, the design process takes about eight weeks, where Jostens will meet multiple times with the winning team to discuss their ideas.

""We we believe very strongly that the team, the owner, the people making the decision should see physical heart samples every time that we meet together,"" Poitras added. ""So we actually will create and craft actual samples that will bring to our presentations to show them.""

After deciding on a design, the manufacturing process then takes about two months, with the finished product typically being ready for a special ceremony for the players in June. Poitras noted that last year's design process was ""as unique as we could ever imagine,"" explaining that the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Chiefs' ceremony and made the design process a little bit longer.

""Obviously [the players] couldn't get together until late in the summer,"" Poitras said. ""So we did our first ever socially distant Super Bowl ring ceremony on the field at Arrowhead Stadium, where everybody was was more than ten feet apart at their own individual table. And the families of the players were able to come, but they had to be socially distant and in the stands to watch it.""

Despite the impact of the pandemic, Poitras said that Jostens was able to scale up production at its three manufacturing facilities in North America and pivot to ensure that last year's Super Bowl ring was delievered on time.

Regardless of who wins, Poitras noted that Jostens will work with both the Buccaneers and the Chiefs to help them celebrate their seasons over the next couple of weeks. Following completion of the design for the rings for Super Bowl LV, Jostens will get to work on rings for the AFC and NFC championships.

Under the tentative agreement, the start of in-person classes, phased in by grade, has been pushed back from the district's initial plans. Classes for some students would start later this week.

The agreement includes expediting vaccination opportunities and prioritizing individuals who live with ""vulnerable family members,"" city officials said. The city has also laid out metrics to pause in-person learning for classrooms if the school's positivity rate reaches above a certain threshold.

But the deal still relies on broader union approval, and it remains unclear when or if a vote will be held for its some 25,000 members, the Chicago Tribune reported.

""We do not yet have an agreement with Chicago Public Schools,"" Chicago Teachers Union tweeted Sunday, while the press conference was still happening. ""The mayor and her team made an offer to our members late last night, which merits further review. We will continue with our democratic process of rank-and-file review throughout the day before any agreement is reached.""

The union and district have been fighting for months over a plan to gradually reopen the roughly 340,000-student district, with talks breaking down in recent days. The major issues included widespread vaccinations for teachers, metrics to gauge school infections and accommodations for teachers who have a person in their household who's more susceptible to coronavirus.

""This agreement was about making sure everyone in our school communities just aren’t safe, but also that they feel safe,"" Lightfoot said.

CHICAGO SCHOOLS, LIGHTFOOT SEND TEACHERS UNION 'LAST, BEST AND FINAL OFFER' FOR REOPENING

CPS officials have said opening schools is safe and that remote learning isn’t working for all students, including many Black and Latino students who make up the majority of the district. Union officials had argued that the district’s plan, which included air filters in classrooms and voluntary COVID-19 tests for teachers, didn’t go far enough

Pre-K and special education students briefly returned last month, but then stopped amid an escalating fight with the union, which voted to continue remote teaching and reject the district’s plans. Teachers and students in K-8 were supposed to return Feb. 1. for the first time since going fully remote last March. The district had offered K-8 students two days of in-person instruction. No return date has been set for high school students.

The union had said that if the district locked out teachers, as it has done previously, teachers would picket. Such a move would have cut off virtual learning for all students. The union last went on strike in 2019.

About 77,000 students from pre-K to 8 expressed interest in returning to class in a December survey. While pre-K and some special education students were offered in-person classes five days a week, students in K-8 were offered two days a week of in-person instruction with remote class on other days. Attendance has been lower than expected.

After 59 years, the couple, both 77, finally reunited for good, after a lifetime of fate happy and sad, joyous and bittersweet.

'CAPTAIN TOM,' 100-YEAR-OLD VETERAN WHO RAISED MILLIONS FOR COVID RELIEF, HOSPITALIZED WITH VIRUS

Dennis and Diane met at Sun Valley Junior High in San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, when they were 13-years-old.

Diane liked his Oregon accent and Dennis had a crush on her.

""For me, it was love at first sight,"" Dennis said to Fox News. ""I think Diane was curious because I was a hillbilly from Oregon.""

""He had a cute accent,"" Diane added to Fox News. ""I mean, we were only kids. We were like 13. We were going steady when we started to see each other – that was a big deal then, you know?""

On Nov. 11, 1961 — five months after they finished high school — Dennis and Diane got married at 18-years-old on Veterans Day.

However, in hindsight, they may have married too soon — they divorced in 1965, very much still in love, after drifting apart in their four years of matrimony.

Dennis remarried twice: in 1969 to Bonnie, who died in 2000, and in 2001 to a woman named Cher, who died in 2018. Diane remarried in 1967 to John, who died in 1981.

'With me, after Diane and I divorced, I married a woman that I had met when I was five years old, but we hadn't interacted over the years. I married her, and we were married for 31 years, and she died in 2000,"" said Dennis. ""Then I married about for the third time, and I lost her about three years ago to cancer. After about a year or so of being by myself, you know I had family and my kids, but I was lonely.""

""During the time we were separated, we both remarried, I had all of my children - it was busy times,"" added Diane. ""I didn't think of Dennis to tell you the truth; I didn't have a warm heart to him. But, he melted my heart with his goodness and his kindness, and that just impressed me, it impressed me so much.""

Dennis and Diane had two sons, but both men met tragic fates. Curtis, born June 1962, died at age 38 in 2001 after multiple surgeries because of injuries sustained in a military mission; Keith, born December 1963, committed suicide at age 25 in 1989 after he contracted AIDS.

They didn’t really keep in touch outside of the trauma about their sons.

""Well, I didn't at all,"" said Diane about missing Dennis. ""We were both married to different people and were busy. I had six kids, and we were both busy in different avenues. So, it was kind of exciting to get back together and fill in all of those gaps. During those 50 years, we were both in different directions.""

""And in different states,"" Dennis added.

""And also, I think we both blossomed. Neither of us had great childhoods, and I think Dennis and I bonded when we were young probably because of that,"" said Diane. ""In those days there was no Oprah, there were no talk shows, there was no way of knowing what's normal and what's not.""

After a lifetime apart, they finally got back together.

In July 2019, Dennis made a checkup call to Diane.

A few phone calls led Diane to fly to Las Vegas for a visit of four days.

""Her daughter lives about a mile and a half from where I lived, and Diane and I have grandkids together,"" said Dennis. ""Our oldest granddaughter came down to see her Aunt Wendy, which is Diane's oldest daughter, and we went to lunch a few times, and then Diane's son came out, and then Diane came out to visit.""

""I came out to visit my daughter, and she was working all day, so Dennis wanted to take me out to lunch, and I said, 'Sure,'"" said Diane. ""So, we went to the Strat, The Link, and they took pictures of us there. I wasn't quite into it because I felt a little bit awkward. It turned out nice.

I was there for four days. So, each day we did something together because I had nothing to do, my daughter was at work all day. I was having a grand ol' time, and so was Dennis.""

""She was setting me up is what she was doing,"" said Dennis.

""It was just plain good fun, and it was nice,"" said Diane. ""It was nice we got to talk about the people that we knew and what they were doing now. Kind of fill in a few of gaps in time.""

Those few back-to-back dates were enough.

Last February Diane moved in with Dennis.

Dennis and Diane remarried again on Veterans Day on Nov. 11 last year: the day of their original wedding anniversary 59 years ago.

""I think that we both matured and blossomed and learned a lot,"" said Diane. ""We both were very successful for what we had been through. When we got back together, it was just wonderful because we had that simplicity again, and we had the money, the maturity that we could go out and do some fun things.""

""I have a buddy and a friend to grow up with, and then here we are…all these years later,"" said Dennis.

Now their love story is ready for a new beginning.

For a late wedding and Christmas present, Dennis, through Veterans United Home Loans, is using his home loan benefit for vets to build a dream home for Diane.

The couple is proof: love is the answer.

""Never give up. You never know,"" said Diane. ""And people maybe that are getting divorced now, perhaps someday in the future, they will meet. Here we are, at 77-years-old, getting married. We are both lucky that we are healthy enough to do a lot, go a lot, walk around, and just enjoy the world.

Ron DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday that keeping businesses and schools open amid the coronavirus pandemic has helped ""lift people up.""

""As other states have tried to lock people down, we’ve tried to lift people up,"" DeSantis told host Will Cain in Tampa ahead of Super Bowl LV.

""You look around the country, they still are debating whether schools should be open,"" he said ""We’ve had schools open the whole year.""

""They talk about whether businesses should be open. Every business in Florida has a right to operate,"" he continued.

""They talk about all these people unemployed. In Florida, every single person has a right to earn a living and our unemployment rate is lower than the national average, even though we are so tourism dependent [and] that market hasn’t recovered at all.""

The national unemployment rate edged down to 6.3% in January from 6.7% in December – well below the April peak of 14.7%, but about twice the pre-crisis level, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report, released Friday.

Florida’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

DeSantis also noted that Florida has ""less COVID mortality per capita than the national average, 25 states or higher, so the lockdowns don’t work on their own, but they cause catastrophic damage to society.""

As of Sunday afternoon, Florida has reported nearly 1.8 million coronavirus cases and almost 27,600 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Cain asked DeSantis to respond to the national media’s criticism of his handling of the pandemic.

""They have a partisan agenda and I think it was an election year. They did not want the president to carry Florida,"" DeSantis responded.

Trump won Florida’s 29 electoral votes in the November election, defeating Joe Biden in the prized battleground state.

DeSantis argued that the media’s narrative ""is whatever helps them advance their political position"" and that the facts don’t matter.

""They don’t care about the facts, in fact they will ignore facts that are inconvenient for their narrative and even concoct conspiracy theories,"" he continued.

""But here’s the thing, people aren’t buying it because people vote with their feet and they are flooding into this state,"" DeSantis added. ""We have investment coming in, we have people buying homes like never before.""

According to a post-move customer survey conducted by United Van Lines, the nation’s largest household goods mover, between March and August 2020 there was a 4 percentage point uptick in actual moves to Florida from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, collectively, compared with last year.

United Van Lines previously told FOX Business that Florida was a top destination for people fleeing the Northeast, with moving interest to Florida from New York City up 10% year over year as of September.

DeSantis noted that ""people are leaving every corner of the state"" to come to Florida simply because schools are open and ""we’ve had sports going on the whole time.""

""I have parents who have moved their kids to Florida because they didn’t want to miss football season, which they would have in some of these locked down states,"" he said.

DeSantis then stressed that ""people don’t buy"" the ""narratives that some of the corporate elite media try to sell.""

""And this is a perfect example because if people bought their narrative, you’d have people leaving here to go to these states that are supposedly doing so well,"" he continued.

""We said we're going to get you $2,000, which is $600 plus $1,400, and what we’re going to do is say that everybody, a single person, individual, $75,000 or lower, and a couple of $150,000 or lower will be eligible for that $2,000 – $600 plus $1,400,"" Sanders said on Sunday.

Biden is reportedly open to compromising on the structure of stimulus checks in his proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. He told House Democrats on Wednesday that he is open to modifying the adjusted gross income thresholds for an additional round of direct payments – but he is holding steadfast to the $1,400 check amounts, according to Politico.

""They are already in Wuhan,"" Cui replied. ""They have been in Wuhan for quite a few days. My questions is, will they be allowed to come here to do the same thing?""

The virus is widely believed to have originated from a bat in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei Province. But it’s unclear whether the first human case was contracted in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology there or from a bat at a so-called wet market – outdoor bazaars where meat, fish and produce are sold.

The WHO has so far refused to confirm whether COVID-19 originated in China, even as President Biden seeks to strengthen ties with the organization, which former President Trump had accused of being in China's pocket.

The U.S. State Department on Jan. 15 said it had ""reason to believe"" scientists in Wuhan may have been infected with COVID-19 in the autumn of 2019, but Beijing has worked hard to prevent a transparent investigation into the origins of the virus.

""The [Chinese Communist Party] has prevented independent journalists, investigators, and global health authorities from interviewing researchers at the WIV, including those who were ill in the fall of 2019,"" the State Department said. ""Any credible inquiry into the origin of the virus must include interviews with these researchers and a full accounting of their previously unreported illness.""

In the same CNN interview, Cui claimed that China’s alleged Uyghur reeducation camps in Xinjiang were ""Just like a campus. Not a labor camp, but campus.""

China has denied a number of allegations about its treatment of the Uyghurs, an ethnic Muslim minority. But American authorities have issued sanctions on the country and businesses in Xinjiang for alleged forced labor and other human rights violations against the Uyghurs, including torture, forced birth control and organ harvesting.

The former ""Three’s Company"" actress, 74, was streaming a makeup demonstration on Friday night when she and her husband, Alan Hamel, were startled by an erratic, non-threatening man who somehow gained access to their Palm Springs, Calif. property.

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Somers noted that the property she lives on resides within a gated community complete with gates, cameras and private property signage.

""He was definitely trespassing,"" Somers told the outlet. ""I was glad I reacted calmly and it turned out OK. You never know what's going to happen in life.""

Near the 40-minute mark of her video, Somers hears a voice inside her home. She’s not immediately concerned as she was expecting dinner guests at the time. However, when the stranger walked into the room, she was clearly shocked by the presence of a stranger in her home. Fortunately, she wasn’t scared.

Despite the shocking ordeal, Somers maintained her cool and even looked to camera at one point during the incident. She credits her ability to remain calm under pressure with having alcoholism in her household growing up.

""I am a child of an alcoholic... and when you live with violence or addiction or alcoholism of any kind, you handle it one of who ways: you either crumble and just can't handle it, [or go into crisis mode],"" she said. ""When you go into crisis mode, you become very calm. You assess the situation and try to calm it all down.""

""I didn't realize that was still a part of me,"" Somers added. ""I went into that crisis mode of, 'There's something dangerous happening right now. I'm just going to try to stay very even and very calm.'""

According to the New York Post, a person watching the livestream saw the event and called the police. However, the person had already been escorted off the property and the incident ended without any injury.

Over his career, he's earned nearly $60 million from his NFL contracts according to Spotrac, and unlike many players, he's built himself a handsome nest egg for years to come.

Continue Reading Below

Although Gronkowski, known by the nickname ""Gronk,"" is a star football player who was blessed with million-dollar contracts, his savings strategy is so simple that anyone can mimic it to achieve their retirement goals. If you're a little low on retirement savings or just want to boost your portfolio, these tips will allow you to claim your retirement victory sooner than you think.

3 SURPRISING PITFALLS OF WORKING DURING RETIREMENT

The game plan

All great goals begin with a plan, and the first step you can take to crush your retirement goals is to start saving. Allocate as much of your earnings as you can to your savings accounts. Don't settle for only saving 10% to 20% of your earnings just because that's the standard path that everyone takes. If you can save more, go for it. If you can't save a lot now, then put yourself in a position where you can easily increase your savings rate one quarter at a time.

Gronk's winning strategy, though, didn't require complex formulas and calculations. ""Keep it easy, and I'd say keep it simple,"" Gronkowski said in a 2019 Business Insider interview. ""Get what you need to be comfortable, save the extra.""

To save more, you typically have to increase your income or decrease your expenses. But if you're like Gronkowski, you can take on the challenge of doing both to expedite your progress.

In his 2015 book, It's Good to Be Gronk, Gronkowski shares the habits that helped him maintain a sizable nest egg. ""Look, to this day, I still haven't touched one dime of my signing bonus money or NFL contract money,"" the former Patriots tight end wrote. ""I live off my marketing money and haven't blown any big bucks on expensive cars, expensive jewelry or tattoos. Heck, I still wear my favorite pair of jeans from high school.""

$226,566 IN FREE RETIREMENT MONEY IS AVAILABLE FOR SOME AMERICANS

Tackle your goals like a pro

Gronkowski saved every dime of the money he received during his NFL career and only touched his endorsement earnings. He landed deals with popular brands such as Nike, Dunkin', Cheerios, Tide, and others that helped to fund his lifestyle.

But if you can't take advantage of all the glamorous endorsement deals that Gronkowski received, don't sweat it. There are perks that everyone can take advantage of at every income level to help them tackle their goals.

For example, once you start saving, you can use a portion of your funds to max out your Roth IRA every year to accumulate tax-free income during retirement. The key here is to invest the money in your retirement account to score big returns. The IRS will even give you a bonus -- the saver's credit -- for saving toward retirement, which can put up to $1,000 or $2,000 back in your pockets in 2021 if you earned a modest income.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

For those who made too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA, then check out the traditional IRA. It's a tax-advantaged account that offers deductions that you can use immediately to reduce your taxable income. Don't forget to look into employer-sponsored retirement plans such as a 401(k) that can give you an additional boost to accelerate your savings goals.

If all else fails, at the bare minimum, you can always pick up a side gig or gain an extra stream of passive income that you can save exclusively for your retirement needs. Having multiple sources of income makes it easier to save.

The retirement touchdown

Gronkowski is not only winning on the football field, but he's tackling retirement savings one game at a time. His moves on the field prove this: There's always a winning move you can make no matter where you stand.

If you apply that same mentality to your retirement strategy, you'll be one step closer to scoring a touchdown in your savings. You may not wake up to millions of dollars overnight, but there's no doubt that Gronk's strategy will enable you to have a healthy nest egg to live the life you want now and in your senior years.",How to crush your retirement savings just like Rob Gronkowski
['Jonathan Garber'],https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/biden-climate-actions-to-jolt-electricity-prices,[],"Electricity prices are set to “skyrocket” as President Biden steers the U.S. economy toward a green-energy agenda, according to experts.",[''],en,,https://www.foxbusiness.com,,set(),"Electricity prices are set to “skyrocket” as President Biden steers the U.S. economy toward a green-energy agenda, according to experts.

Continue Reading Below

Biden has pledged to achieve a net-zero electricity grid by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050.

Solar and wind make up a respective 1% and 3% of all U.S. energy, according to a report published last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Coal, petroleum, and natural gas account for a combined 79% of U.S. energy.

Biden’s new energy and climate plans are designed to “get coal-fired and natural gas-fired electricity prices high enough that then solar and wind become competitive,” said Gregory Wrightstone, executive director of the CO2 Coalition, which seeks to educate the public about the important contributions carbon dioxide makes to our lives and the economy.

BIDEN CLIMATE ORDERS PUT WYOMING IN CROSSHAIRS

Ticker Security Last Change Change % UNG UNITED STATES NATURAL GAS FUND LP UNIT (POST REV SPLIT) 10.53 -0.31 -2.86%

The shale revolution and fracking have caused natural gas prices to plummet over the past decade. Prices were projected to be over $20 per one thousand cubic feet, and instead are today under $2. Coal prices are also declining.

But electricity prices are already going up because of the ""wasteful, duplicative solar and wind on our grid,” said Alex Epstein, founder and president of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit think-tank seeking to bring a new industrial revolution.

Because solar and wind are unreliable energy sources and don’t replace power plants on the grid, their costs are not replacement costs and are instead additional costs. Mining for materials and solar panels requires oil and forging the different components of solar panels and wind turbines use coal.

Tens of millions of Americans live in energy poverty, experiencing hardship to pay for basic energy needs. Twenty-five million Americans say they have forgone food or medicine to pay for electricity and 10 million say they’ve kept their home at an unsafe temperature.

BIDEN'S ENERGY MOVES STRENGTHEN RUSSIA, US RIVALS, UNDERMINE NATIONAL SECURITY

The U.S. isn’t the first developed nation to attempt a transformation into a renewable-energy based economy.

Germany began its shift to renewables in 2000 and in 2019 it produced 515.6 terawatt-hours of power with 46% coming from solar, wind, biomass and hydroelectric generation. Germany aims for renewables to account for 65% of total energy production by 2030.

Electricity prices in Germany “have doubled just to get to thirty-three percent solar and wind, and they're having all sorts of issues,” Epstein said.

Neither Duke Energy Corp., Exelon Corp. nor Consolidated Edison Inc. responded to FOX Business’ request for comment about how Biden’s plans could impact electricity pricing.

Implementing Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan will take time and money and the results may not result in the desired outcome. The president has already signed a flurry of executive orders aimed at transitioning the U.S. economy away from its reliance on fossil fuels toward cleaner, renewable energy sources like solar and wind.

BIDEN'S CLIMATE ORDER HALTING DRILLING ON FEDERAL LANDS WILL KILL 58K JOBS, OIL GROUP WARNS

Those orders include a temporary ban on new permits and leases for drilling on federal lands and waters, revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and reentering the U.S. into the 2016 Paris climate agreement, paving the way for a “clean energy revolution.”

The administration's ""Climate Czar"" -- John Kerry -- last month acknowledged that Biden’s agenda wouldn’t have the desired impact in the global climate fight.

“We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn’t solved,” Kerry said, noting that almost 90% of global emissions come from outside the U.S.

The U.S. was the world’s second-largest CO2 emitter last year, accounting for 15% of total emissions, according to Earth Systems Science Data.

U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions have since 2007 declined eight of the past 12 years, falling from 119 million metric tons to 102 million metric tons, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.

While emissions are falling in the U.S., the trend, barring the 2020 impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, is higher in China and India, the world’s largest and third-largest emitters which account for 28% and 7%, respectively, of the world’s total.

Lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 for months eliminated nonessential travel around much of the world, resulting in 2020 global carbon emissions falling by about 7%, the largest annual drop ever reported, according to a study conducted by the Global Carbon Project.

Emissions from the world’s biggest emitters were down across the board – falling 2% in the US, 11% in the EU, 9% in India, and 1.7% in China.

While Wrightstone believes the decline in carbon emissions is “significant,” he notes there was no drop in the levels of atmospheric CO2.

Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution have risen from 280 parts per million to more than 400 parts per million today. They continue to rise.

Wrightstone says the theory behind Biden’s climate plan is that a carbon taxation scheme and the regulation of the oil, gas and coal industries out of existence would lower CO2 emissions, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas warming from C02.

The problem, he says, is that there has been no evidence of “any atmospheric CO2 levels being reduced.”

There's “no doubt we're in a warming trend” that started 300 years ago, said Wrightstone, who believes modest warming and increasing levels of CO2 benefit Earth’s ecosystems and humanity.

“Those natural forces that cause temperature to rise for the first two hundred and fifty years did not suddenly cease in the middle of the 20th century,” he added. “Whatever this plan is and there's really no evidence that it will do anything to help.”",Biden climate actions to jolt electricity prices

Evan Rachel Wood, 33, who dated Manson between 2007 and 2010, first named Manson as her alleged abuser last week, saying he 'horrifically abused me for years.'

In footage obtained by TMZ Manson reads from the letter: 'You couldn't even look me in the eyes because you were drunk.'

As they cheer he adds: 'Now let's not assume this is written about me. Don't be prejudiced. Don't be racist toward me.

He continues to read from the letter: 'I hope your show especially fails.' His fans boo as he then says: 'It's starting to sound like me a little bit.'

Manson adds from the letter: 'I hope you trick every dumb girl into thinking they got the golden ticket.' He adds: 'Do I need to read the rest?' The crowd chant 'yes' before he screws up the letter and continues with his performance.

It is not clear who wrote the letter.

Wood is one of at least 11 women who have come forward this week to accuse the rock star of physical and sexual abuse dating back several years.

The allegations vary but include incidents involving physical violence, sleep deprivation, being plied with drugs, forced into blood pacts and one woman having a gun held to her head.

Wood has said she was forced to file a police report last year after claiming that Manson's wife Usich was 'conspiring' to release photos of her when she was 'underage' to 'ruin my career' and 'shut me up'.

She shared a photo of the police report and one of the pictures she said Usich had threatened to release, showing Wood in Manson's stage hat and an Adolf Hitler-style mustache drawn on her face.

Wood also shared screengrabs of an online chat discussing someone named 'Lindsay' asking for 'pictures of Evan doing things that would ruin her career.'

On Friday, she also posted fresh claims that Manson hurled anti-Semitic abuse at her, has three Nazi tattoos and drew swastikas on her bedside table 'when he was mad' during their relationship.

Senators Kevin S. Parker and Susan Rubio have both called for full investigations while Manson has denied all the allegations as 'distortions of reality'.

Industry insiders have sought to distance themselves from the controversial rocker with his record label, talent agency and long-time manager Tony Ciulla all dropping him this week.

She claimed Usich was trying to get her hands on compromising photos of Wood taken after Manson performed a show in Las Vegas.

Wood alleged Usich, a 36-year-old artist who wed Manson last year, wanted the photos to silence her.

'On Dec 19th, I had to file a police report after I was alerted to threats made by @leslee_lane and @lindsayusichofficial (Brian's Wife) for conspiring to release photos of me when I was UNDERAGE, after being given large amounts of drugs and alcohol, after Brian performed on Halloween in Las Vegas to ''Ruin my career' and 'Shut me up,'' Wood wrote.

The actor said a conversation about the photos 'took place on a discord channel' and she shared screengrabs of a chat between two accounts on the app.

The conversation takes place between two users called Born Villain - the name of one of Manson's albums - and Clownfish.

It begins with Born Villain saying she is 'not happy' because 'Lindsay' is 'trying to get my photos.'

Clownfish asks what they 'mean[s] by that' and questions what 'the issue is.'

Born Villain writes that they 'could bury her career in one minute' before later clarifying 'pictures of Evan doing things that would ruin her career'.

'Yes, my personal camera took pictures of Evan and everyone. I haven't shared them with anyone until Lindsay say Evan in the background of one I sent of MM and myself. Now she wants more of this to use to shut her up,' Born Villain writes.

There is no suggestion in Wood's post that any photos were handed over to Usich.

Usich and Manson have been in an on-off relationship since 2012 before they married last year.

Usich has stayed silent on the allegations that surfaced against her husband this week. DailyMail.com has reached out to her for comment on Wood's claims against her.

Wood was among the first to publicly accuse Manson of abuse in an Instagram post Monday where she claimed he starting 'grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years'.

Since then, at least 11 women have come forward accusing the rocker of physical and sexual abuse dating back several years.

Wood shared more details of the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of the rock star on her Instagram story Friday.

She claimed Manson, real name Brian Hugh Warner, would use the 'N-word', called her 'a 'Jew' in a 'derogatory manner' and told her it was 'better' that her mother had converted to Judaism and did not have Jewish descent because it meant she wasn't 'blood Jewish'.

Wood posted photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols, just days after another alleged victim claimed the 52-year-old rocker once asked her to buy him Nazi paraphernalia.

Wood also denied she and Manson were just having 'kinky sex' when he 'tortured' her saying they 'never had a 'BDSM' relationship' and that she 'thought [she] was going to die.'

Wood was among the first to publicly accuse Manson of abuse in an Instagram post Monday where she claimed he starting 'grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years'

Wood said Friday Manson made derogatory comments about her Jewish heritage on top of the 'grooming' and 'horrific abuse' she previously said she endured.

'I was called a 'Jew' in a derogatory manner,' she wrote in an Instagram Story.

'He would draw swastikas over my bedside table when he was mad at me.'

Wood explained that her mom is Jewish and she was raised in the religion.

'Because she converted and wasn't of Jewish descent he would say things like, 'that's better' because I wasn't 'blood Jewish,'' she said.

The actor also shared photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols.

Wood circled the tattoos on his arms and shared a screen grab from an article of a similar-looking skull-and-crossbones adopted by the Nazis.

'Totenkopf is German for 'death's head' and typically refers to a skull-and-crossbones image,' it reads.

'During the Nazi era, Hitler's Schutzstaffel (SS) adopted one particular Totenkopf image as a symbol.

'Among other uses, it became the symbol of the SS-Totenkopfverbande (one of the original three branches of the SS, along with the Algemeine SS and the Waffen SS), whose purpose was to guard the concentration camps.'

Wood shared another image of a tattoo on Manson's chest and a screengrab from community site Manson Wiki that claims the image is an M-swastika.

'He did not have these tattoos when we started dating,' Wood wrote.

One of Manson's other accusers, Ashley Lindsay Morgan, claimed this week he had once asked her to buy Nazi memorabilia for him in Asia and bring it to the US.

Hollywood actor Wood, 33, shared more details of the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of the rock star on her Instagram Story Friday

She claimed Manson, real name Brian Hugh Warner, called her 'a 'Jew' in a derogatory manner'

As well as the anti-Semitism and Nazi symbolism, Wood also claimed Friday Manson would often say the N-word and that, if anyone tried to confront him about it, they would be 'abused more.'

'I heard the 'n' word over and over,' she wrote.

'Everyone around him was expected to laugh and join in. If you did not or (god forbid) called him out, you were singled out and abused more.'

Wood said she had 'never been so scared in my life.'

The actor, who met the rock star when she was just 18, hit out at suggestions the abuse was just 'kinky sex'.

'Brian and I never had a 'BDSM' relationship,' she said in a now-deleted Instagram story.

'We didn't even have 'kinky' sex. We weren't having sexual intercourse when I was being tortured, before or after.'

She added: 'I thought I was going to die the entire time.'

Wood also shared footage from her testimony before the US Congress and California Senate in 2018 where she spoke about her experience with domestic violence and rape as part of a campaign to advocate for Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Acts in all 50 states.

The 33-year-old also shared photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols. Wood circled the tattoos on his arms and shared a screen grab from an article of a similar-looking skull-and-crossbones adopted by the Nazis

Wood also shared an image of a tattoo on Manson's chest and a screengrab from community site Manson Wiki that claims the image is an M-swastika

Wood added in another Instagram story that Manson 'did not have these tattoos when we started dating'

She also shared posts from Manson's other alleged victims, news stories documenting the claims, and an article responding to the questions being leveled at the women who have come forward.

Wood first named her alleged abuser on social media Monday.

'The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,' she wrote in a social media post.

'I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

'I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

'I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.'

She also posted screenshots of tweets written by Dan Cleary - Manson's former assistant in December 2020.

He said in them that he knew Wood when she was with Manson and that by the end of their relationship, he had 'broken' her.

In a 2009 interview with Spin, Manson made disturbing remarks about wanting to 'smash' Wood's skull in.

He was being asked about his new album and was asked: 'It sounds like the period after you and Evan Rachel Wood broke up was really tough. What was your lowest point?'

He replied: 'My lowest point was Christmas Day 2008, because I didn't speak to my family. My walls were covered in scrawlings of the lyrics and cocaine bags nailed to the wall.

She also denied they were just having 'kinky sex' when he 'tortured' her saying they 'never had a 'BDSM' relationship' and that she 'thought [she] was going to die'

'And I did have an experience where I was struggling to deal with being alone and being forsaken and being betrayed by putting your trust in one person, and making the mistake of that being the wrong person.

'And that's a mistake that everyone can relate to. I made the mistake of trying to, desperately, grasp on and save that and own it. And every time I called her that day — I called 158 times — I took a razor blade and I cut myself on my face or on my hands.

'I didn't want people to ask me every time I did an interview, 'Oh, is this record about your relationship with your ex-girlfriend?' But that damage is part of it, and the song 'I Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies' is about my fantasies.

'I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.' The interviewer replied: 'Wow'. He replied: 'Merry Christmas'.

Manson and Wood got engaged after the interview and did not break up for another year after it took place.

When the comments resurfaced in November 2020, Manson's reps downplayed them as him being a 'theatrical rockstar'.

'The comments where Manson had a fantasy of using a sledgehammer on Evan and he cut himself 158 times was obviously a theatrical rockstar interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account,' they said.

'The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally.'

Wood, now 33, was engaged to Manson for eight months in 2010.

In 2018, she testified before Congress as part of a campaign for domestic violence victims about being tied up, raped and beaten by a partner when she was a teenager.

At least 11 women have now come forward to accuse him of abuse dating back years

She did not name her abuser at the time but said she had been told she could not take it to police because the statute of limitations had expired.

'My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gas-lighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body,' she said.

Wood was one of five women who made coordinated statements on Instagram Monday about how Manson allegedly abused them.

They are Wood, an artist known only as Gabriella; photographer Ashley Walters; model Sarah McNeilly; and model Ashley Lindsay Morgan.

They claimed they had been victims of sexual misconduct, manipulation, and physical and emotional abuse at Manson's hands.

The women's allegations vary but all say Manson left them with PTSD after forcing them into blood pacts, plying them with drugs, becoming violent with them and gaslighting them.

Artist Gabriella claimed she dated Marilyn Manson for six months between 2015 and 2016 and that he drove her to attempt suicide after tying her up, depriving her of sleep and plying her with drugs during their relationship which began when she was 22 and he was 46.

She shared photographs of herself with Manson and texts she says he sent her to add validity to her story.

On Monday night, another three women made allegations on social media that Wood re-posted on her account. They did not go into detail about their relationships with Manson but all three said he was an abuser.

Wood first named her alleged abuser on social media Monday (above)

Evan Rachel Wood (shown with Manson in 2007) named him as her abuser on Monday in an Instagram post. The pair dated and became engaged in 2010 but split later that year

Those women are Scarlett Kapella, Brittany Leigh, and Torii Lynn.

On Tuesday, four more women made allegations against the rocker.

Visual filmmaker Love Bailey claimed Manson once held a gun to her forehead.

In an Instagram video she claimed that Manson told her he didn't 'like f*****s' as he held the weapon to her head while she was working at a shoot in his home in 2011.

Musician Chloe Black spoke out on Instagram to allege Manson deprived her of sleep, made racist and anti-Semitic comments and that she once 'thought he was actually going to kill me.'

Artist and writer Louise Keay Bell claimed Manson 'emotionally and financially abused me and tried to control me' from the age of 19.

Actor Charlyne Yi also alleged Manson harassed her and other women on the set of the TV series House and said when she spoke out about the abuse three years ago she had received death threats.

Former porn star Jenna Jameson told DailyMail.com this week that Manson fantasized about burning her alive and 'liked to bite' during sex when they dated back in 1997.

On Thursday, Indie star Phoebe Bridgers said she 'stand[s] by' Manson's alleged victims as she recalled a time she visited Manson's home as a teenager and the 52-year-old rock star showed her a room he described as his 'rape room'.

She slammed people now 'pretending to be shocked' about the abuse allegations as 'f**ing pathetic'.

Manson has denied all the claims since they started surfacing.

He said in a statement Monday: 'Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

'My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.'

Comments were turned off the post, but it was liked by Manson's wife, Lindsay Usich. She has not released her own statement.

Manson's ex-wife Von Teese addressed the allegations leveled at Manson in a statement on Instagram Wednesday.

In it, the 48-year-old burlesque star said she had been 'processing the news' about her ex, who she dated for six years before they tied the knot in 2005.

Love Bailey spoke out Tuesday evening about a time Manson allegedly put a gun to her head

On Monday night, Scarlette Kapella (pictured left) and Torii Lynn (pictured right) both also said they too had been victims of abuse by Manson

CALIFORNIA SENATOR DEMANDED FBI PROBE INTO MARILYN MANSON A WEEK BEFORE THE ACCUSERS WENT PUBLIC California State Senator Susan Rubio requested an FBI and Justice Department probe into Marilyn Manson more than a week before his accusers went public with their claims. On January 21, Rubio wrote to the FBI and Attorney General demanding an investigation into Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. She demanded that investigators contact his accusers to find out more about their claims. On Monday morning, Evan Rachel Wood and four other women posted statements alleging years of 'horrific abuse' by Manson in what appeared to be a coordinated move. On Monday night, Wood posted a photo of Rubio's January 21 letter on her Instagram account. Now, Rubio's office is refusing to say how they knew about the abuse allegations early. Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department will confirm if they have opened an investigation. Rubio's letter reads: 'The alleged victims have named Marilyn Manson, also known as Brian Hugh Warner, as the perpetrator. 'I ask that the U.S. Department of Justice meet with the alleged victims immediately and investigate these accusations,' Senator Rubio wrote in the letter. 'As a domestic violence survivor who now advocates for victims in my role of California state legislator, I share a common trauma of emotional, psychological, and physical control at the hands of an abuser.' Rubio added that she was 'especially alarmed' because some of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place in California. Advertisement

Von Teese insisted the experiences detailed by Manson's alleged victims 'do not match' her own experience with the rock star.

'Please know that the details made public do not match my personal experience during our 7 years together as a couple,' she wrote.

'Had they, I would not have married him in December 2005.'

She said she left Manson and filed for divorce 12 months after they wed 'due to infidelity and drug abuse.'

While Von Teese said she had not been abused by Manson during their time together, she wished 'strength' on the women who had come forward.

'Abuse of any kind has no place in any relationship. I urge those of you who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself,' she wrote.

Von Teese said she also appreciated the 'kindness' of people who voiced concern for her 'well-being' following the news this week.

Rose McGowan, one of Manson's former girlfriends, also said in a statement that while he was never abusive to her, she 'stands with' the accusers on Monday.

Manson has since been dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Records, talent agency CAA and he has been edited out of American Gods and Creepshow, two shows he was taking part in.

On Friday, Tony Ciulla, his manager of more than two decades also distanced himself.

Ciulla, who hasn't commented on the abuse allegations against his client, dropped Manson after Woods publicly named him on social media earlier this week, a source told Rolling Stone.

There are now also questions around how the allegations came to the surface.

California State Senator Susan Rubio wrote to the FBI and the Justice Department demanding an investigation into Manson on January 21 - a week before the claims became public.

No investigation has been launched and Manson has never been arrested for any of the women's allegations.

LAPD cops were called to Manson's Hollywood Hills home over concerns for his safety Wednesday night amid the growing number of allegations against him.

Four police cruisers and an LAPD helicopter were dispatched to Manson's home around 6.00pm to perform a 'welfare check' on the 52-year-old after a concerned friend couldn't get in touch with him, reported TMZ.

An LAPD spokesperson told DailyMail.com officers from the North Hollywood division responded to a call for a welfare check at a home on the 3400 block of Troy Drive, Studio City, around 6.00pm Wednesday.

Police later told DailyMail.com they were able to make contact with someone and found there was 'no evidence of any trouble whatsoever' at the property.",Marilyn Manson hinted at trouble with an ex reading from a letter on stage in 2015

And Phoebe Dynevor hinted that filming for series two could be starting very soon as she sported her character's signature auburn locks on Saturday.

Phoebe dressed comfortably for the flight in her oversized loungewear and a multi-coloured scarf.

She added a beige padded jacket and black face mask for the journey and toted a brown leather handbag over one shoulder.

The beauty had tied her red locks back into a messy bun, letting two strands down at the front to frame her face, just as Phoebe often styled her hair in the Netflix series.

Phoebe has recently changed her hairstyle after being seen out in Manchester with her family just two weeks ago with blonde tresses.

Phoebe's hint about filming potentially being on the horizon comes after she claimed dating in the 19th century was easier than modern times as men in the past were more romantic and not distracted with dating apps or social media.

In an interview, the actress remarked that men in the past were more likely to make grand romantic gestures to declare how they felt, adding: 'The problem today is there's no social etiquette.'

She told Conan O'Brien: 'The problem today is there's no social etiquette. If someone was into you in those days they'd come around with a big bouquet of flowers, so you knew where you stood.'

The beauty, whose mother is Coronation Street star Sally Dynevor, added that boys in Bridgerton times 'had to work for it'.

However, Phoebe did note that there were advantages to courting in modern times as she noted her character's one-time suitor Nigel Berbrooker.

She added: 'If there's a Nigel of today I do not have to pander. I can just say: ""I am good thank you.""'

Meanwhile, Phoebe, who plays the lead character in the hugely popular Regency drama, recently said the 'hardest scene to shoot' was a solo sex act where she had to perform having an orgasm.

The show explores the fiery relationship between Phoebe's character and the dashing Duke of Hastings (played by Regé-Jean Page), with their honeymoon sex scenes dominating the middle episodes of the show.

Speaking in a new interview with Glamour, Phoebe candidly revealed the difficulties the actors faced when shooting the more racy scenes, especially when it came to exploring her character's emerging sexuality.

Romeo Beckham proved he's taking after his father David as he looked near-identical to the former sports star while attending soccer practice with Inter Miami in Florida on Saturday.

The 18-year-old looked in his element as he hit the pitch with his teammates while dad David, who is a co-owner of the club, and brother Cruz, 15, watched on.

Romeo was seen chatting with some of his fellow players during training before he worked on his football skills.

Bend it like Papa Beckham! Romeo Beckham followed in his father David's footsteps (pictured right in 2004) as he joined his dad and younger brother Cruz at soccer practice with Inter Miami in Florida on Saturday

The teen sported a blue jersey and black shorts while he also wore a face mask for some of the training.

As Romeo hit the pitch, it was clear he had inherited his father's keen sports skills. Yet the talented teen also seemed to be emulating his dad's style as he sported a man bun famously rocked by David in the Noughties.

A source told MailOnline: 'Romeo has been enjoying some training with the youth team. He plays a lot of football at school in the UK so it's great for him to join in when he's in Miami.

'His dad is obviously going to the training grounds for work, ie when we saw him playing with the academy players the other week, and Romeo is enjoying going along with him.'

The former Burberry model also suggested he is following his father's keen interest in body art after revealing a large tattoo on his calf. He revealed the inking - thought to be his second - last month, and showed off the tattoo again as he took to the pitch.

Appearing to depict a large eagle in flight, the black ink design is not dissimilar to the lifelike work carried out at his father's tattoo studio of choice - Hollywood's Shamrock Social Club.

Similar: Romeo showed off his new calf inking, which looks strikingly like the eagle tattoo beneath David's left armpit (right) albeit on a notably smaller scale

David, 45, is understood to have more than 60 designs inked across his body, with many dedicated to his fashion designer wife Victoria, their four children and his illustrious playing career.

It is also strikingly similar to the eagle tattoo inked beneath David's left armpit, albeit on a notably smaller scale.

However it is not Romeo's first time under the needle, with the teenager previously revealing a small tattoo on his rib-cage while holidaying with his family in Greece last August.

Meanwhile, former footballer David who retired in 2013, looked in good spirits as he watched his son play.

David - who sported a dark green T-shirt along with dark trousers and a black cap - appeared to wear his mask below his mouth for some of the training despite people being told to wear one when closer than six feet to others.

The sports star was also seen giving his youngest son Cruz, 15, a hug outside the pitch.

Brady, 43, who recorded his seventh Super Bowl win last night as he steered the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a comfortable 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, even cuts out certain 'healthy' vegetables - such as tomatoes, eggplant, capsicum and mushrooms - because they can cause inflammation.

The father-of-three also only eats organic, has a gluten-free diet - and tries to drink at least five litres of water a day.

Despite following rigid eating schedule, Brady said he still likes to treat himself occasionally

Brady's former personal chef Allen Campbell said that in the lead up to the Superbowl, the football star's meals consisted of 'dark leafy greens, some grass-fed animal protein as well as legumes and whole grains'.

Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen hired personal chef Allen Campbell to do all of their home cooking.

Mr Campbell, who worked for Brady and Gisele from 2013 to 2016, insisted the couple are 'very laid back' to cook for despite their diet being made up of 80 per cent vegetables.

'I make conscious decisions to buy local and organic, and to stay away from GMOs, and to think about the future of the planet and the future of humans,' he said.

'My philosophy is that a plant-based diet has the power to reverse and prevent disease.'

Brady's dinners consist of roasted veges and chicken, while snacks include hummus, guacamole, or mixed nuts

Campbell previously told how he uses raw olive oil but never cooks with olive oil.

'I only cook with coconut oil. Fats like canola oil turn into trans fats,' he added. 'I use Himalayan pink salt as the sodium. I never use iodized salt.'

On game day, Brady's day on a plate consists of just an almond butter and jam sandwich and a smoothie.

Tom Brady's day on a plate 6am: 500ml glass of water infused with electrolytes Breakfast: Avocado and eggs 8am: More electrolyte-infused water, followed by a post-workout protein shake Lunch: Salads with nuts and fish Snacks: Hummus, guacamole, or mixed nuts Dinner: Roasted vegetables and chicken Game day food: Smoothie and an almond butter and jelly sandwich Advertisement

His favourite is said to be made with blueberries and banana, hemp and chia seeds, walnuts, almond butter and hemp milk.

In 2000 during his rookie season, Brady's diet was far more substantial. He once admitted to chowing down on nachos, ham-and-cheese subs with onion rings and a large orange soda before taking to the pitch for the biggest day on the NFL calendar.

Despite following a rigid eating schedule, Brady said he still likes to treat himself occasionally.

'If I'm craving bacon, I have a piece,' he told Men's Health in 2020.

'What's changed as I've gotten older is now if I want pizza, I want the best pizza. I don't eat a slice that tastes like s**t and then wonder, 'Why am I eating s**t pizza?'

Campbell said Brady also 'talks often of his love for a good burger and dark chocolate,' reports The New York Post.

Specifically, he indulges in Unreal Chocolate, a brand of vegan, gluten-free, low-sugar chocolate.

According to Brady's website TB12, the six-time Superbowl winner stops eating two to three hours before bed, and never eats fruit by itself - unless it's bananas in a smoothie.

The 12-step guide also advises people to pay attention to portion sizes, saying a plate should include two palm sizes of vegetables and one-palm size of protein.

The NFL allowed 25,000 fans in Tampa Bay's home stadium for the matchup with Kansas City. Raymond James Stadium normally holds about 75,000 fans.

Brady, who has competed in 10 Super Bowls, signed a two-year $50 million deal with the Bucs in March last year, after a 20-year spell with the New England Patriots.

He threw three touchdown passes to prevent the Chiefs becoming the first back-to-back NFL champions since the Patriots in the 2004 season.

Charlotte spoke about trying to be taken seriously as an actress in Hollywood after being hailed as a sex symbol following her viral commercial in 2015, telling the Daily Beast: 'I've been put squarely in a box and I'm still in that box.'

She continued, 'There's nothing wrong with it necessarily but it's been a struggle to try and get out of. I started my career as 'the Carl's Jr. commercial girl' who was a bikini model, so I've always felt a degree of judgment from that.'

The pandemic has not been easy on her as she confessed, 'To have full days of just you forces you to over-analyze your work, or your body, or your face, or anything. You pick things apart...So, I've tried to stay busy focusing on other people.'

To break up the monotony, she and Kostechko took a trip to Miami ahead of the new year and she has been volunteering with Best Buddies. Additionally she now boasts her own YouTube channel.",Charlotte McKinney enjoys date night with her boyfriend Nathan Kostechko in Santa Monica

Previously under-the-radar brand Seasum has blown up on the app, with TikTok creators raving about the leggings' super affordable price point and ability to lift, sculpt and shape your cheeks. Videos of user sharing their reactions to the leggings have racked up millions of views on the app.

The honeycomb high waist gym leggings have been praised for their ability to create the illusion of more rounded, firmer and higher butt. No squats needed.

Amazon is no stranger to trending products (remember the Orolay Jacket?) but the Seasum leggings are the latest in the mega-site's repertoire of 'must-have' hyped purchases.

The asset-enhancing leggings currently has close to 30,000 reviews on Amazon, with shoppers gawping over the difference they make to your silhouette.

'Just cave into the tiktok pressure! You'll thank me!' wrote one shopper in their review. They fit like a perfect dream. Like they are so soft.

'I can hold them out and see through them but you can't see threw them while they're on. Wild magic trickery. I want more. My fiance loves them.'

This week, Lizzo posted on Instagram showing herself sporting a black pair of the honeycomb textured leggings

Another reviewer added: 'I am OBSESSED with these leggings! I hadn't tried them before but decided to give it a go after seeing them on TikTok. Highly recommend, though they don't come with pockets. They're super flattering though!

'I LOVE the way my legs look in these pants,' wrote one customer. 'The textured pants really conceal every imperfection. The scrunch gives your buns a very flattering look.'

It is worth noting that a few shoppers have described these pants as mainly fashion leggings. So while you certainly can wear them to the gym, they may not be up to more rigorous exercises. If you're in between sizes shoppers have also added that it might be worth sizing down as these can stretch.

Robert Jobson, a royal biographer who knew the late Princess' 'well' said that it was 'inevitable' The Firm won't enjoy the picture 'at all'.

The film, directed by Pablo Larraín and written by Steven Knight, will focus on a 'pivotal' weekend at Sandringham and also stars Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris.

'I knew her as a person, it's inevitable that the royals won't like the biopic at all,' Jobson, who has written multiple books about the royal, told Us Weekly.

'They won't like it, but they would have expected it. It is the truth, I think the most important thing is how well the actress can interpret the role. We'll have to wait and see on that.

Robert Jobson, a royal biographer who knew the late Princess' 'well' said that it was 'inevitable' The Firm won't enjoy the picture 'at all'. Kristen Stewart is pictured in the role

In June last year it was revealed that the Twilight actress, 30, would depict the late royal in a film which dramatises a 'critical' few days at the Norfolk estate in the early 1990s, when Diana decided that her marriage to Prince Charles wasn't working.

It follows the moments in which the Princess of Wales realised she 'needed to veer from a path that put her in line to one day be queen', and is said to take place during one of Diana's final Christmases at the House of Windsor in Sandringham.

Jobson added that the photographs of Stewart looked 'remarkably like Diana' and 'uncanny'.

'I think what's more important is the authenticity of the portrayal, and we'll have to see how that develops because my understanding is it's going to be a good script and it's going to be a good premise, but it might not necessarily have actually happened in the way they're saying,' he continued.

It comes as new accuracy row has broken out over the upcoming film with royal experts branding it inaccurate because it's set on a weekend at Sandringham which never happened.

According to Jobson and fellow biographer Ingrid Seward, Diana had stopped visiting the estate before the period in which the drama is set.

Robert added that Diana had already made the decision regarding her marriage 'years before', while Ingrid pointed out that the princess 'never wanted a divorce'.

It comes as new accuracy row has broken out over the upcoming film with royal experts branding it inaccurate because it's set on a weekend at Sandringham which never happened. Princess Diana and Prince Harry are pictured

It follows widespread criticism of Netflix drama The Crown, which saw politicians, experts and friends of the Royal Family call for a disclaimer to warn viewers that the show twists the truth. Friends of close senior royals including Prince Charles even went so far as to accuse it of 'trolling on a Hollywood budget'.

Speaking on True Royalty TV 's The Royal Beat, Robert said: 'I don't even think she was there that weekend. She wasn't even at Sandringham, on this supposed weekend.

'The film will suggest this is where the decision was made to divorce, but she never made that decision. I didn't think she was at Sandringham after 1990 and this was set in 1991.'

Kristen, 30, left, said she hasn't been excited about a role in a long time ahead of her portrayal of Princess Diana (right in 1994)

Ingrid added: 'The film is based on three days at Sandringham, and the period that it is based on, Diana wasn't going to Sandringham anymore.

'It's probably going to just play up what life was like at Sandringham, which would be quite interesting for a lot of people to see. It has a good setting.'

The screenplay of Spencer was written by Steven Knight, who worked on Peaky Blinders, so Robert predicted the film will be 'explosive and rock n roll'.

Like The Crown, the latest series of which was branded a 'spiteful attack on the Royal Family by making them look like inept idiots' by Angela Levin, author of Harry: Biography of a Prince, Robert suggested this film will also mix fact with fiction.

'I think it's a shame because there's so much out there that we know that is true, but then again they need that scope to be able to do a fictional drama like this,' he said.",Royal family will 'not like' upcoming Princess Diana biopic Spencer starring Kristen Stewart

The 42-year-old DJ headlined a show on Saturday night at the Godfrey Waterfront Hotel's WTR Tampa Pool in anticipation of the annual sporting event.

Before the event, the producer posted a few photos to his Instagram to show his fans that he had taken precautions before playing the show.

No worries: On Saturday evening, Diplo played a show for 2,000 fans in Tampa, Florida in anticipation of the Super Bowl; virtually no safety protocols were observed during the event

He's fine: The producer took to Instagram to show his fans that he had taken precautions before playing the show

The producer shared a snap of himself with a mask on, which he removed for his performance.

He included a photo of a sign that partially read, 'Masks are mandatory...please social distance and wear mask at all times.'

Diplo also shared a picture confirming that he had received two vaccinations for COVID-19 before the event.

However, many of the 2,000 fans who attended the party did not appear to be observing safety protocols, as photos and videos showed concertgoers standing close to one another as they watched the DJ perform.

Not even necessary: Diplo posted a photo of a sign that had been posted outside the performance venue asking fans to stay safe during the concert; it appeared to have been ignored by many of the concertgoers

Proving it: The DJ also included a snap to prove that he had been twice vaccinated against COVID-19

In a release obtained by TMZ, the Tampa Police Department condemned the partying that occurred last night and bemoaned the lack of regard for public safety.

The statement partially read, 'Scenes from WTR last night and a few other clubs were incredibly disappointing.'

The crowd apparently went wild when Diplo played his hit with Morgan Wallen, Heartless, days after the country star was removed from multiple platforms and dropped from his record label after shouting a racial epithet following a night out.

Diplo was not the only entertainer who put on a safety-devoid show yesterday evening, as rapper 50 Cent hosted his own concert to celebrate the upcoming sporting event.

Host: 50 Cent also hosted a pre-Super Bowl event of his own on Saturday; he previously headlined a show the night before with little to no regard for public safety

Special guests: Flavor Flav and Flo Rida were also spotted at the In Da Club songwriter's function

Numerous other musicians, including rappers Tory Lanez, Flo Rida and Flavor Flav, made appearances at the concert.

Like Diplo's event, virtually no COVID-19 safety guidelines were observed by either the performers or the fans during the show.

The 45-year-old hitmaker is also set to host a watch party for the Super Bowl tonight.

Mask off: Steve Aoki also hosted an event of his own at the WTR Tampa Pool on Friday evening, where he sprayed champagne over a crowd of fans on Friday

DJ Steve Aoki also hosted a pre-Super Bowl party of his own at the WTR Tampa Pool at the Godfrey Waterfront Hotel on Friday, which TMZ covered.

The event's organizers made a point of expressing that masks had to be worn and that everyone should have maintained six feet apart from each other.

However, footage from the event showed that neither protocol was being followed by anyone in particular.

The 43-year-old DJ and producer also came into close contact with his fans in order to spray champagne over them.

In attendance: French Montana, ready to party, arrived to an event with a mask in hand, but not on his face; Montana pictured with Funkmaster Flex at The Big Game Bash at The Ritz Ybor

Cutting loose: Montana and Rick Ross co-headlined a large concert in anticipation of the annual sporting event; very few fans were seen wearing facial coverings or observing social distancing guidelines; French pictured at The Big Game Bash at The Ritz Ybor

That same day, rappers French Montana and Rick Ross co-hosted an event and shared several videos to their respective Instagram Stories.

Neither the majority of the performers or the fans in attendance were seen observing any coronavirus safety protocols.

By the early 1990s, the Frida star had moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film; but the transition to an English-language audience in the U.S. wouldn't come without many detractors.

In a new interview, Hayek revealed that she was told her acting career would 'die' when she was in her mid-thirties, and that she would never make it in Hollywood as a Mexican actress.

Revealing: Salma Hayek, 54, opened up about the detractors who told her she would never make it as a Mexican actress in Hollywood

'They told me my career in Hollywood would die in mid-thirties because there was no one,' Hayek, 54, said while promoting her new science-fiction drama film, Bliss.

'First of all, they told me a Mexican is never going to make it because, at the time, with the new generations, it was impossible for a Mexican to have a leading role in Hollywood.'

It's at this point that Hayek turned to look right into the camera and added, 'It was not real,' in a defiant reference to those who gave her little chance of making it in Hollywood.

She would go on to relish in the reality that an actor like herself in a leading role in more recent years has become much more of a 'reality or normalcy.'

Sweet success: 'I fought it. I fought and won. And I want other women to realize that,' Hayek said of her success as a leading lady despite the many naysayers

Artistry: Her breakthrough role came in 2002 when she played Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, for which she was nominated for Best Actress for the Academy Award

Now she is considered a trailblazer for plowing past all of the naysayers and detractors with memorable roles in such films as the biographical drama Frida (2002), which earned her a Best Actress nomination and the drama film Beatriz At Dinner (2018).

'I think it's great; I'm proud of it,' she said of her success since her move to the U.S.

'I want to shout it to the world because I was told so many times it couldn't happen, and I almost believed them.'

'But I fought it. I fought and won. And I want other women to realize that,' she said with a confident laughter to her voice while emphasizing that she succeeded despite the pressures she felt as a lead actress in her thirties and her forties.

And late blooming: 'it's a beautiful thing.'

Turning heads: The Mexican-born actress gained attention for her small role in the American horror film From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)

Later in the evening on Saturday, Hayek took to Instagram and shared two behind-the-scenes clips of herself dancing on the set of Bliss, which was written and directed by Mike Cahill.

In the movie, Owen Wilson plays a man whose life is in disarray when he meets a beautiful woman (Hayek) who tries to convince him he is living in a simulation.

It premiered on Amazon on February 5, 2021.

Hayek first turned heads in the U.S. with her short but memorable role as an exotic dancer in the American horror flick, From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).

She would go on to star in such movies as Fools Rush In (1997), Breaking Up (1997) and 54 (1998). Her breakthrough role came in 2002 when she played Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, for which she was nominated for Best Actress for the Academy Award.

He also added that the longtime pals have been going to the beach together for nearly a decade, calling the day in question pure 'fun.'

The source also confirmed that Ofer was a 'casual' fling, adding 'They've gone on a few dates and she likes him but she truly doesn't want anything serious.'

Sofia seemed to acknowledge that she had outgrown Disick prior to splitting as she cryptically posted an excerpt from a book that read:

'Sometimes we outgrow people we used to know and become different people. When this growth happens, some take our changes personally. Not because they have anything against us but because they do not recognize the person that we are now (sic).'

In a statement to Us Weekly, the source said: 'Britney has been on the receiving end of so much hate through the years, particularly on social media. She would never want her fans to release the hounds on Justin.

'Hate isn’t going to solve anything, regardless of what happened in the past.'

Embattled exes: An insider close to Britney Spears is speaking out regarding the troubled star's feelings about her ex Justin Timberlake, after Brit's fans have dragged Justin upon seeing Friday night's Framing Britney Spears documentary; seen here in 2002

'Britney does not hold a grudge against Justin over anything he’s said or done,' the source added.

'She feels that they were young and in love and both did stupid things when they were together. She was heartbroken when they separated, but it’s not something she dwells on now. She’s happy and happy for him.'

The statement comes after fans have demanded that Timberlake, 40, apologize to the star for his handling of their breakup, in light of the FX/Hulu documentary Framing Britney Spears.

The exposé explores the dark side of the Toxic hitmaker's fame, from her rise as a childhood star to her 2007 breakdown and her father Jamie's controversial 13-year conservatorship, which launched the #FreeBritney movement.

'Britney does not hold a grudge against Justin over anything he’s said or done,' the source said in a statement; Spears seen here on her Instagram

However, a large number of viewers have accused Justin of having a hand in tarnishing Britney's image following their split in March 2002, while veteran journalist Diane Sawyer, 75, was branded a 'sl**-shamer' for her subsequent interview with the star.

During the teen years of Louisiana-raised Britney's superstardom, she was heavily sexualized after publicly declaring that she was a virgin.

As she grew into adulthood she was needled in interviews about her breasts and questioned on whether she had remained a virgin as her romance with Timberlake from 1999 to 2002 saw her hailed as one half of a pop world power couple.

Outing: Britney Spears and ex Justin Timberlake painted on smiles at the 2002 Super Bowl in unseen snaps taken WEEKS before bitter split that were revealed on Saturday... after fans slammed the Cry Me A River singer over explosive documentary

Frosty atmosphere: In the restaurant, Justin and Britney sat beside each other but they appeared to not speak to each other as they simply watched the game and chatted with other people at their table

However, once the pair eventually split in 2002, Justin all but accused his ex of cheating on him when he released his hit track Cry Me A River, which included a video of a Britney lookalike reaping the consequences of infidelity.

And while Britney had continued to publicly maintain that she was still a virgin, Justin suggested otherwise in post breakup interviews.

In a flash, Britney was widely seen as the one responsible for the split and even her interviewer Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her: 'What did you do?'

Points of view: Viewers piled in with their cutting points of view after the documentary aired in the US on Friday night

In 2003, Britney sat for an interview with Diane – who played a clip of Maryland's First Lady Kendall Erlich saying figuratively that 'if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears I think I would', a remark for which she later apologized.

Veteran journalist Diane appeared to gently justify the harsh and shocking statement – which was made in reaction to the star wearing 'revealing' clothes, which was cited as a bad influence on children – as she pressed Britney for a response.

When Britney got over her shock at the remark she managed to counter: 'I'm not here to, you know, babysit her kids.'

MailOnline has contacted Justin and Diane's representatives for comment.

Cutting: Viewers branded Diane Sawyer, 75, a 'sl**-shamer' for her interview with the star, in which she questioned her about the breakup and her 'revealing' clothes'. Pictured in 2019

Line of questioning: The viewers took umbrage to the veteran journalist's line of questioning

After the airing of Framing Britney Spears, which aired in the US on Friday night, viewers took to Twitter in droves to strike out at Justin and Diane.

Wrote one: 'Justin Timberlake laughed and got 'revenge' in cry me a river ...Britney had to go on TV with Diane Sawyer and break down crying in an interview after they broke up...That s**t would NOT fly in today's culture. #FreeBritney'

Tweeted another viewer: 'Nasty a*s old people asking a teenage Britney all the time if she was a virgin. How big her boobs gotten. And Justin Timberlake publicly announcing that he took her V card!!! The s**t she went through.'

'I think it's time for @DianeSawyer to issue a public apology to Britney Spears,' said a third. 'She treated her disgustingly and never once said sorry. Speak up sis. You were VERY wrong for the way you interviewed her.'

Grilling: Following the 2002, split, Britney was widely portrayed as the villainess and even Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her, 'What did you do?'

Penned another fan of the star: 'Diane Sawyer literally tried to defend a woman who said 'If it wasn't illegal to shoot Britney I would' to Britney because Britney was wearing 'revealing' clothes and mothers are worried about their children because of it? LIKE WTF???'

However, some fans jumped to former NSYNC frontman Justin's defence, explaining that he was also young at the time of his split from Britney.

Explaining their stance, one wrote: 'All this Justin and Britney shit was way too much for two young ppl. They were way too young for ppl to have so much expectations and so much judgement. #FreeBritney (sic)'

'Am I the only Britney fan who also loves Justin Timberlake?' queried another. I get he should have apologized for things he said but sometimes if the two parties involved have no ill will, doesn't mean we have to put ourselves between their issue. She has moved on.'

The pair first denied they had broken up for weeks despite rumors suggesting they had, with Britney confirming she was single a few days after their latest denial.

At the time of Britney and Justin's split, it was rumored that she had cheated on the pop heartthrob with dancer Wade Robson, now 38.

However, it has also been claimed that Justin cheated on Britney multiple times in the year leading up to them calling time on their ill-fated romance.

In the years following the couple's breakup, Britney would endure a very public unravelling, that culminated in her shaving off her hair in early 2007.

Paloma decided to step down due to the imminent arrival of her second child.

Mel recently made headlines when she reflected on her battle with depression, stressing the importance of reaching out to loved ones for help.

The Spice Girl was diagnosed with depression more than two decades ago and has often spoken about it as well as struggling with an eating disorder.

In a spin! The series won't air until Christmastime, and will see an array of singers, aged seven to 14, taking to the stage in a bid to impress the star coaching panel and get those big red chairs turning

While chatting on The Graham Norton Radio Show on Virgin Radio, Mel encouraged her fans to 'never be embarrassed' to talk about their mental health.

Mel explained how at first she was too 'ashamed' to talk about it, but speaking about how she was feeling was an essential part of getting well again.

She said: 'I kept those secret and I think people are quite aware of it around you but they don't know how to approach you.

'I think I would have just said ""people love you and care about you, please reach out to them""... So often you need that external help, you have to be ready, but you do need help and personally for me I needed professional help.'

The Who I Am singer continued that she thinks many people are 'embarrassed' to speak up despite it being vital.

She added: 'I've suffered with an eating disorder as well. I think a lot of people feel very ashamed and very embarrassed about it like it's a weakness and you've lost this control...

'It's so important to reach out and never, ever be embarrassed. We all have problems and concerns. People need people.

Elsewhere in the interview, Melanie - who released her self-titled eighth solo album last year - admitted she's made peace with the fact she will always be remembered as a Spice Girl.

She said: 'When you've been part of something as enormous as the Spice Girls that's the thing that everybody's going to remember you for, but I'm so grateful that it's enabled me to go on and make my eighth studio album.'

This follows Gerard's recent controversial gender stereotyping row, leading to the banning of a South African beer advert.

The Paisley-born actor fell foul of advertising standards with his TV ad for Diageo-made Windhoek beer.

They banned the commercial for suggesting real men, like Butler, drink real beer.

Butler agreed to take part in the ad despite having his well-publicised battle with the booze. He went tee-total after a spell in rehab, checking into the Betty Ford clinic in 2012.

He claims not to have drank alcohol since then.

Butler is seen casually dressed and bearded while enjoying a pint at the bar with the slogan: 'It's time for the perfect beer.'

The beer brand used a 'gentle looking' man who succumbs to the pressure of 'macho' movie star Gerard Butler, said South Africa’s Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB).

The ad features Butler, described in the regulator's decision as 'a macho looking movie star', remonstrating with a bar patron who asks for a slice of lime with his Windhoek.

'Hey, that’s a Windhoek. It’s 100% beer. You don’t need any lime,' Butler tells the other customer, before turning to the camera and says, 'Keep it real, Joe. Keep it real.'

Getting involved: The ad features Butler, described in the regulator's decision as 'a macho looking movie star', remonstrating with a bar patron who asks for a slice of lime with his beer

The man he takes to task, says the ARB, 'is a gentle looking, red-headed man – two characteristics that might typically make him a target for teasing in a toxic environment'.

By showing a man deciding against having a lime with his beer, Windhoek is entrenching toxic masculinity, the regulator ruled.

The interaction between the two, the regulator ruled, sends an unavoidable message that is not acceptable in advertising, especially because it does not actually come out and say that real men drink real beer.

Don't do it: 'Hey, that’s a Windhoek. It’s 100% beer. You don’t need any lime,' Butler tells the customer, while sitting at the bar with a pint of lager

Zest free: By showing a man deciding against having a lime with his beer, Windhoek is entrenching toxic masculinity, the regulator ruled

'The reality is that it is exactly the unspoken nature of the communication that makes it particularly dangerous – the gender stereotype portrayed as so normal that it does not even require explanation,' said the ARB.

It took issue with both 'the entrenchment of the role of men as having to behave in a certain way' and 'the entrenchment of male behaviour that is bullying, and what has come to be labelled as ""toxic masculinity""'.

The decision cites a clause in the ARB's code of advertising practice that bans 'gender stereotyping or negative gender portrayal' unless it is 'reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom'.

Heineken, the brewers of Windhoek, had argued its central character had ordered a lime out of habit, 'and when he tasted the Windhoek Lager without the lime, his response was one of appreciation.

Dan co-created the Pop TV series Schitt's Creek with Eugene, who also starred in it along with his longtime comedy partner Catherine O'Hara.

The series initially had small viewership, but it gained new fans after its third season when it began streaming on Netflix, before wrapping up its sixth and final season in April 2020.

'Doc basically groomed Marty to like molest him, but then the Doc regretted it so the reason he built the time machine was to go back in time to prevent him from molesting Marty,' he suggested in front of the stunned tour guide.

The Harry Potter star was spotted embracing boyfriend Leo Robinton as they returned from a pre-Valentine’s Day trip to Mexico.

The 30-year-old actress wore a £19.99 T-shirt bearing the French slogan ‘Femme Liberte’ but all eyes were on her jewellery collection and the ring, albeit modest, on her wedding finger.

But as well as the small band, she looked to be sporting an injury – as she had her right foot in a flip-flop and the left in a sock, and needed help to get about from a knee scooter.

Gallant boyfriend Leo, 31, a business owner, was on hand to help Emma, whose other films include Beauty And The Beast and Little Women, as she leaned on him while they made their way out of Los Angeles airport in California.

Leo is from Los Angeles but he and Emma are not believed to be living together.

Ms Watson, who is an advocate for social movements such as Black Lives Matter and MeToo, is famously tight-lipped about her private life.

But it seems she has met a kindred spirit in Leo, who in 2017 took part in the Women’s March in Washington DC.

Emma was spotted embracing boyfriend Leo Robinton as they returned from a pre-Valentine’s Day trip to Mexico

They are believed to have been dating for about 18 months – and have been spotted together in Britain too, pictured together several times near Emma’s London home, getting coffee and visiting a bakery.

It has been reported that she has introduced him to her lawyer parents.

She has previously spoken positively about the men in her life. ‘The boyfriends or partners I’ve had have generally made me feel really cherished. They’ve built me up,’ she has said.

The actress, best known as student wizard Hermione Granger, famously told Vogue magazine in November 2019 that she was ‘self-partnered’ rather than single.

‘I never believed the whole “I’m happy single” spiel,’ she said.

She looked to be sporting an injury – as she had her right foot in a flip-flop and the left in a sock, and needed help to get about from a knee scooter

‘It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.’

The type of scooter Emma was using is often prescribed by clinicians to help patients with knee, ankle or tendon injuries. She adorned hers with orange, green and blue fur covers

Before meeting Leo, Emma was rumoured to be dating Potter co-star Tom Felton, 32, after they posted a picture together in their pyjamas. He later revealed he was single. Her last relationship was with New York businessman Brendan Wallace, 38, in 2018.

There is, unfortunately, no magic way to find out if Emma definitely has become engaged, and her team isn’t telling – they did not respond to calls last night.",Has hobbling Emma Watson scooted off to get herself engaged?

The singer-turned-designer's music company Moody Productions brought in £3.3 million in the tax year ending December 2019, while her eponymous fashion firm was hit with pre-tax losses of £16.6 million.

While Victoria, 46, opted to sit out the last Spice Girls tour in 2019, she still raked in almost £1 million, as she was entitled to one-fifth of the takings for endorsements and deals generated by the tour, reports The Sun.

Earnings: Victoria Beckham took home more cash from music than from her fashion empire over the past tax year – despite not touring with her Spice Girls bandmates. Pictured in 2020

She raked in the tidy sum as bandmates Mel B, Mel C, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton hit the road without her for their national tour.

While her umbrella firm Beckham Brand Holdings boasts £14.5 million in dividends, the star netted £641,667 in director’s pay from her fashion firm, which calculates to be five times less than the money she took home from her pop career.

A source told The Sun: 'Her beauty business is thriving and she is focusing on building that. It has been a hit with and they’ve been loving the fact it’s affordable.'

Added a spokesperson: 'Like so many businesses, a challenging retail landscape coupled with the unforeseen effects of the coronavirus pandemic, has adversely impacted the Victoria Beckham business.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Victoria Beckham for comment.

Bandmates: She raked in the tidy sum as bandmates (L-R) Mel B, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Mel C hit the road without her for their national tour back in 2019

Like countless retail businesses across the country, the star's Fashion company Victoria Beckham Ltd has suffered an impacting blow amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Back in May, Victoria abandoned plans to seek a government bailout to furlough 30 members of staff at her fashion brand following a major backlash.

The former singer, whose family is said to be worth £335 million, had planned to use the government's scheme to pay 80 per cent of the wages of some of her staff.

Her fashion brand, which employs 120 people, sent letters to 30 members of staff warning them that they were going to be furloughed under the Government's scheme for two months.

She told The Guardian at the time: 'We will not now be drawing on the government furlough scheme. At the beginning of the lockdown the shareholders agreed with senior management to furlough a small proportion of staff.

Movements: Victoria's fashion house more than halved its losses on the year prior, according to a Companies House report from the year ending December 2019

'At that point we didn’t know how long the lockdown might last or its likely impact on the business. The welfare of my team and our business means everything to me.'

It is understood the firm's application would have cost taxpayers £150,000.

The firm denied the U-turn was a result of the public backlash and instead insisted the board 'now believe that with the support of our shareholders, we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme'.

In a statement, the company said: 'Victoria Beckham Ltd has been working hard to protect its people and, while adjusting to the impact of COVID-19 and the government lockdown, our decision to furlough a small number of our staff seemed the most appropriate option in keeping with many other businesses.

'The situation is dynamic, and, with the support of our shareholders, we now believe we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the government furlough scheme.

Cash: While Victoria opted to sit out the last tour in 2019, she earned almost £1 million, as she was entitled to one-fifth of the takings for endorsements and deals generated by the tour

'Our application was made in the best interests of trying to protect our staff, and that is still our absolute focus. We are doing everything we can to ensure we can achieve that without using government assistance.'

Despite the news, Victoria and her husband David Beckham have still reaped the rewards of their empire as a separate company filing reveals they paid themselves £14.5 million in dividends.

Victoria's fashion house also more than halved its losses on the year prior, according to a Companies House report from the year ending December 2019.

In the year before the coronavirus pandemic hit, it appears the couple enjoyed a bumper 12 months following success in both of their companies.

The couple relaxed the purse strings and took an increase of £3.4 million in dividends from David's company compared to 2018.

David's global brand management company DBVL is now is fully independent following the buyout of XIX Entertainment's 33 per cent stake in 2019.

The company, which supports the David Beckham brand, enjoyed a revenue increase of £600,000 to £16.2 million for the year thanks to licensing and brand partnerships.

DBVL has long-standing partnerships with huge brands such as Adidas, Haig Club (Diageo), Tudor, Coty, insurance company AIA and hotel group Sands.

Throughout the year David's brand launched DB Eyewear and production company Studio 99, as well as the build-up to the launch of Inter Miami CF.

Growth: Victoria's eponymous luxury fashion label grew seven per cent (£2.5 million) in revenue to £38.3 million, driven by continued growth in the fashion business

According to the report, David's social media platform is the number one most followed and engaged social media account in the UK and continues to reach a global audience.

Pre-tax profits were down to £11.3million from 14.8million, due to charitable donations to UNICEF, increased headcount to meet the growth of the business and adverse currency effects.

Meanwhile, Victoria's luxury fashion label grew seven per cent (£2.5 million) in revenue to £38.3 million, driven by continued growth in the fashion business.

It will have also been aided by the launch of the Victoria Beckham Beauty brand in the last quarter of 2019.

The report states that 'all channels' grew in the fashion business, with the flagship Dover Street store performing strongly and achieving double-digit revenue growth.

As a result of the revenue growth and cost control, the fashion business more than halved its losses, from £10.5 million in 2018 to £4.6 million in 2019.

Directors continue to focus on taking the company to break even.

The report noted that since the year end (2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted trading, with Victoria's Dover Street store subject to lockdown restrictions, which has in turn impacted revenues.

However, over this period the company's online operation saw positive year-on-year growth, including over 20% in the UK.

Internationally, the brand continues to grow with Europe up 36 per cent and Australia up 44 per cent. The Company also launched a homeware capsule which had 80 per cent sell-through within two weeks of launch.

With more than 50 million combined followers globally, Victoria Beckham's social media platform has been key to driving product sales.

New venture: David's brand launched DB Eyewear and production company Studio 99, as well as the build-up to the launch of Inter Miami CF (pictured at Inter Miami CF ground)

In 2020, it drove 15 per cent of total traffic to the website and 10 per cent of revenue.

Victoria Beckham Beauty has continued to perform strongly in 2020.

The brand has been recognised in the industry for both beauty and skincare, and has won twelve awards this year, most notably Vogue's 'Best New' beauty brand and Glamour's Beauty Awards in both the US and the UK.

Meanwhile, Victoria's bandmate Mel B recently insisted the girls are up for marking their 25th year 'as soon as the rules allow it'.

With countless shows and tours cancelled and postponed over the past year thanks to the pandemic, the singer admitted it's been tricky to put plans into motion, having reformed the group for a Spice World UK tour in 2019.

'People need a bit of entertainment. Music brings people together. I would love it - as soon as the rules allow it, then yeah,' Mel said, as reported the The Mirror last month.

She went on: 'Until the virus gets under control I don't think anyone can securely say ""I'm definitely going on tour"".

'When it comes to putting on a show or concert, I don't know how people are going to do it without the proper guidelines and information, because things change on a weekly basis.

'Us lot are definitely up for it - it's just a case of timings and safety. I'm always itching to get back on to the stage.'

It's thought that Mel has been coaxing Victoria to take part in marking Wannabe, after she opted not to tour with the group in 2019.

Wanna reunite? With the 25th anniversary of the Spice Girls' debut single Wannabe approaching in 2021, Mel B has insisted the girls are up for marking the occasion

Whether Posh Spice would be up for more than a one-off is unsure, having ruled it out in the past.

This follows comments from Mel C that the band want to tour the US next, which they have not done since their 2008 reunion The Return Of The Spice Girls.

She told Access Hollywood: 'We love being in the USA and have had so many great times there doing TV shows and promotional stuff. And we so want to get back there.

'We do not have any plans, but we are hooking up quite soon and that needs ­certain discussion. We need things to look forward to and we can make good plans for something positive in the future.'

The singer admitted previously that it 'would be rude' not to celebrate their impressive milestone this year.

She said: 'We had the most incredible year last year, playing stadiums and we have got to do it again. We talk about it all the time.

'Of course [2020] has thrown everything into chaos, I think a lot of the big artists that were planning to perform this year will move to [2021].

'So sadly it probably will delay the Spice Girls getting back on stage, but I’m doing everything in my power to make that happen.'

Victoria and her husband, former footballer David, have become a power couple in the celebrity world since tying the knot in 1999.

The couple share four children – sons Brooklyn, 21; Romeo, 18; Cruz, 15, and nine-year-old daughter Harper.",Victoria Beckham took home MORE cash from music than her fashion empire last year

In December she announced that she is gay and dating a woman, but she and her husband have elected to remain together regardless.

Sean and Braunwyn, who met when she was an 18-year-old college student and married in 2000, were both grinning broadly on their trek.

Meanwhile Braunwyn and her girlfriend looked closer than ever on while out together in Palm Springs on Wednesday and were holding hands.

Braunwyn indicated on social media that she was gay back in the fall of 2020, but she officially came out as a lesbian during an early December interview with GLAAD.

Her own love interest: Braunwyn officially came out as gay in early December and shared her first photo of Kris on Instagram the same day

'I like women. I'm gay,' she said at the time.

'I'm a member of the LGBTQ+ community. It has taken me 42 years to say that but I am so proud of where I am right now,' she continued. 'I'm so happy where I am. To be able to be comfortable in my own skin after so long is just so nice.'

The same day that her interview was posted, Braunwyn gave her 317,000 followers their first glimpse of Kris in a sweet selfie as they embraced while on a hike.

Coming to terms: Last month, her husband Sean Burke said he was heartbroken that his wife was never attracted to him or other men, but 'in some ways it was a relief' to know it wasn't just him; still from the RHOC Reunion Part 2

The reality star is currently still married to her husband Sean, who appeared with her late in January on the RHOC reunion episode.

During the episode, Braunwyn admitted to Andy Cohen that she had never been attracted to men, including her own husband, but that her attraction to women 'didn't correlate with what [she] wanted' for 'the perfect life.'

Sean said he was heartbroken to be told that, but 'in some ways it was a relief' to know that the lack of attraction wasn't just about him.

'Of course we have an emotional connection, we're best friends, and we enjoy each other that way, but that was a part of our relationship that was really hard and really challenging,' he explained.

Hard to move on: Braunwyn admitted in January in an Instagram Q&A that she would 'be heartbroken' if Sean started dating other women. DailyMail.com revealed photos of him with his new girlfriend in January

Braunwyn also opened up about how hard it was to see Sean starting to date after the romantic component of their marriage ended.

'I didn't take it well,' she said in response to learning he was dating a new woman.

During an Instagram Q&A with her fans in early January, she admitted she would be 'heartbroken' if her husband fell in love with another woman, though the two seem to be making the best of their open marriage.

'It's hard,' he admitted during the reunion. 'After being with someone for 25 years, of course it's hard to say, ""Oh my gosh, how did this happen? How did I not see this?"" But on the other hand, she's so much happier and we don't fight.'

DailyMail.com previously revealed that Sean had been seen on an intimate lunch date with his new girlfriend, while a source said the two were 'really handsy' with each other.

Investigative documentary 'Allen v. Farrow' delves into one of Hollywood's biggest scandals, drawing on home movies, police evidence, court documents and recorded conversations to explore the 1992 allegations made against the filmmaker by his daughter with then-wife Mia Farrow.

The documentary also examines Mia and Allen's doomed relationship as they turned overnight from one of Hollywood's hottest couples to becoming embroiled in bitter custody battles, abuse allegations and Allen's marriage to Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn.

It features exclusive interviews from Mia, Dylan and Ronan Farrow - the New Yorker journalist who led reporting on the #MeToo movement and the couple's only biological child.

Allen and Previn did not take part in the documentary, nor did Moses Farrow, the son of Allen and Mia.

Allen has repeatedly denied all the allegations of sexually abusing Dylan.

A representative for Allen didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment from the filmmaker.

Woody Allen with Mia Farrow and their children Soon-Yi Previn, Dylan, Ronan and Moses around 1990. Never-before-seen footage of seven-year-old Dylan Farrow accusing her father Woody Allen of sexual abuse will air for the first time in an explosive four-part documentary series on HBO

The series, airing February 21, will show the videotape account of the abuse from 7-year-old Dylan shot by Farrow publicly for the very first time, reported the New York Times.

The tape has been the source of much debate with some citing it as evidence of the abuse and others as evidence Dylan was led by Farrow to make the accusations.

'It took a long time for Dylan to feel comfortable and safe sharing that video. And once she shared it, there were parameters about whether she would be OK with us actually using it,' filmmaker Amy Ziering told the Times.

'It was incremental. We are not about contributing to anyone else’s pain.'

In the documentary, critical questions are also raised about the Yale Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, which investigated the abuse allegations.

The clinic interviewed Dylan nine times in seven months when the accusations were first made and ruled that her claims weren't credible.

But much of the notes taken from those interviews were destroyed when the final report was issued, reported the Times.

The documentary makers told the paper Mia told them she was still scared of Allen and only took part in the series for the sake of her children.

'She said, “My daughter came to me, said this is important to me and I need you to do this for me,""' Ziering said.

HBO teased a trailer for the series Friday in which Mia is seen describing how she 'couldn't believe' the abuse allegations when she first heard them.

'Who on earth could believe that of Woody Allen? I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it,' she says.

The trailer opens with a voice saying 'this is a case unlike anything the state of Connecticut has confronted.'

'A report says Farrow may have coached the child to tell the story,' another voice is heard saying as the camera pans over family photos.

The trailer closes with a shot of Dylan today as a voice is heard saying: 'No matter what you think you know it is just the tip of the iceberg.'

The investigative documentary 'Allen v. Farrow' delves into one of Hollywood's biggest scandals. It draws on home movies (above), police evidence, court documents and recorded conversations to explore the 1992 allegations made against the filmmaker by his daughter with then-wife Mia Farrow

HBO said Friday the series 'goes behind decades of sensational headlines to reveal the private story of one of Hollywood's most notorious and public scandals: the accusation of sexual abuse against Woody Allen involving Dylan, his then seven-year-old daughter with Mia Farrow; their subsequent custody trial, the revelation of Allen's relationship with Farrow's daughter, Soon-Yi; and the controversial aftermath in the years that followed.'

The documentary will explore the 'private story' through interviews with Mia, Dylan and Ronan and investigators, and an examination of court documents and previously unreleased material, the channel said.

Family friend Carly Simon, prosecutor Frank Maco, relatives, investigators and other first-hand eyewitnesses are among those also speaking out publicly on the issue for the first time.

Film experts will also discuss Allen's work and its re-evaluation in light of his personal life.

Dylan first accused her father, now 85, of sexually abusing her when she was seven.

Allen has long denied the allegations.

When the allegations surfaced in 1992, he held a press conference saying the claims were not true and accusing Mia of manipulating their adoptive daughter into making it up.

At the time, Mia and Allen had split after Mia discovered naked photos of her then 21-year-old adoptive daughter Soon-Yi in Allen’s apartment.

It emerged that Allen was having an affair with Soon-Yi and left Mia for her. They later married and remain together to this day.

Mia and Allen were both fighting for custody of Dylan, Ronan and Moses during the split.

In his 2020 memoir, Allen again denied abusing his daughter.

He said he 'never did anything to her that could be even misconstrued as abusing her; it was a total fabrication from start to finish.'

The same memoir had been dropped by its original publisher Hachette after staff staged a protest against it. Dylan thanked the staff who 'took a stand.'

She has maintained that she was abused and her allegations have been embraced in the #MeToo era.

Two separate investigations were conducted in the 1990s and no charges were brought against Allen.

And family friend and former assistant, Felicia Culotta, appeared several times throughout the two-hour special to weigh in on some of the most pivotal moments of Spears' life and career.

Culotta also addressed the 39-year-old's ongoing legal battle against father Jamie Spears over who should control her estate.

Another perspective: Britney Spears' former assistant opened up about her changing roles as part of Team Britney in new documentary -- Framing Britney Spears

In the documentary, which premiered Friday night, Culotta claimed to have the distinction of being the first person to be hired to 'Team Brit.'

Working as a nanny in New York City in 1998, Culotta sais she was asked to meet with Britney and her mother Lynne Spears at a restaurant on the same weekend she signed her first record deal at the age of 15.

Lynne allegedly explained how she couldn't meet the travel demands of the budding pop star's schedule and needed Culotta to travel with her at all times.

'I don't know that I ever really had any definition on what I was supposed to do with Britney. For a long time they called me her chaperone,' the Louisiana native said in the interview.

Eventually, Culotta said they all agreed that she would take on the title of assistant: 'I definitely wasn't her mother or her big sister, so we settled on assistant.'

Team Brit: Culotta's job title was eventually changed from 'chaperone' to 'assistant'; the pop star is pictured in 1999, about one year after Culotta was hired to travel with her

Court battles: Britney Spears has tried to have her father, Jamie Spears, removed from her conservatory since it was enacted in 2008; her mother and father are seen in Nov 2012

Culotta maintains she initially agreed to be Britney's 'chaperone' for only three months. But she would stay on board as part of her inner circle, leading to her 2007 breakdown amid mental health concerns, and a subsequent conservatorship the following year.

As part of the conservatorship, a judge put her father, Jamie Spears, in control of her money and assets, which has been contested by Britney over the years.

The legal battle has been played out against the backdrop of the #FreeBritney movement, led by fans who believe Spears is being controlled against her will. Just this past November, she lost another legal attempt to remove his control over her estate.

'To be honest, I didn't then nor do I now understand what a conservatorship is. Especially for somebody's Britneys age and somebody capable of so much I know, firsthand, she's capable of,' Culotta said of the court arrangement.

Her take: 'To be honest, I didn't then nor do I now understand what a conservatorship is. Especially for somebody's Britneys age and somebody capable of so much I know, firsthand, she's capable of,' Culotta said of Britney's conservatorship; the pop star is pictured with her father Jamie, Spears, brother Bryan and mother Lynne in 2006

It turns out once the conservatorship became legal Culotta was shifted from an 'assistant' role to a job giving backstage tours during Britney's Circus Tour in 2009.

'When I went back, it was a different business management and her dad was involved. They did not hire me, the touring company hired me,' she explained.

'I don't know why the Britney company didn't hire me. All I know is, maybe, they didn’t know the role I had played earlier. So I took a backseat and simply did what I was hired to do. I don’t really know what went on, I just don't know that they knew her well enough to realize her capabilities in making the decisions. Just me looking in, that’s what I saw.'

Culotta made a point of sharing why she went forward and detailed her experience with Britney for the documentary.

'The one reason I agreed to do the interview is so we can remind people why they fell in love with her in the first place,' she confessed.

Framing Britney Spears premiered on Friday on both Hulu and FX.

Frosty atmosphere: In the restaurant, Justin and Britney sat beside each other but they appeared to not speak to each other as they simply watched the game and chatted with other people at their table

Former couple: Justin spoke at the event with Britney by his side, but before stepping out on stage they didn't seem to be as enthusiastic as they stood side-by-side

Fans have demanded Timberlake apologise to the star for his handling of their breakup, in light of the documentary Framing Britney Spears.

The exposé explores the dark side of the Toxic hitmaker's fame, from her rise as a childhood star to her 2007 breakdown and her father Jamie's controversial 13-year conservatorship, which launched the #FreeBritney movement.

However, a large number of viewers have accused Justin of having a hand in tarnishing Britney's image following their split in March 2002, while veteran journalist Diane Sawyer, 75, was branded a 'sl**-shamer' for her subsequent interview with the star.

Looks: Justin and Britney wore an array of expressions during their evening, as one moment saw the pair laugh in delight while in another the Hit Me Baby, One More Time singer appeared forlorn

Outraged: Fans have demanded Timberlake apologise to the star for his handling of their breakup, in light of the documentary Framing Britney Spears

During the teen years of Louisiana-raised Britney's superstardom, she was heavily sexualized after publicly declaring that she was a virgin.

As she grew into adulthood she was needled in interviews about her breasts and questioned on whether she had remained a virgin as her romance with Timberlake from 1999 to 2002 saw her hailed as one half of a pop world power couple.

However, once the pair eventually split in 2002, Justin all but accused his ex of cheating on him when he released his hit track Cry Me A River, which included a video of a Britney lookalike reaping the consequences of infidelity.

And while Britney had continued to publicly maintain that she was still a virgin, Justin suggested otherwise in post breakup interviews.

Accusation: A large number of viewers have accused Justin of having a hand in tarnishing Britney's image following their 2002 split (Pictured left in 2001 and right in 2002)

Points of view: Viewers piled in with their cutting points of view after the documentary aired in the US on Friday night

In a flash, Britney was widely seen as the one responsible for the split and even her interviewer Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her: 'What did you do?'

In 2003, Britney sat for an interview with Diane – who played a clip of Maryland's First Lady Kendall Erlich saying figuratively that 'if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears I think I would', a remark for which she later apologised.

Veteran journalist Diane appeared to gently justify the harsh and shocking statement – which was made in reaction to the star wearing 'revealing' clothes, which was cited as a bad influence on children – as she pressed Britney for a response.

When Britney got over her shock at the remark she managed to counter: 'I'm not here to, you know, babysit her kids.'

MailOnline has contacted Justin and Diane's representatives for comment.

Cutting: Viewers branded Diane Sawyer, 75, a 'sl**-shamer' for her interview with the star, in which she questioned her about the breakup and her 'revealing' clothes'. Pictured in 2019

Line of questioning: The viewers took umbrage to the veteran journalist's line of questioning

After the airing of Framing Britney Spears, which aired in the US on Friday night, viewers took to Twitter in droves to strike out at Justin and Diane.

Wrote one: 'Justin Timberlake laughed and got 'revenge' in cry me a river ...Britney had to go on TV with Diane Sawyer and break down crying in an interview after they broke up...That s**t would NOT fly in today's culture. #FreeBritney'

Tweeted another viewer: 'Nasty a*s old people asking a teenage Britney all the time if she was a virgin. How big her boobs gotten. And Justin Timberlake publicly announcing that he took her V card!!! The s**t she went through.'

'I think it's time for @DianeSawyer to issue a public apology to Britney Spears,' said a third. 'She treated her disgustingly and never once said sorry. Speak up sis. You were VERY wrong for the way you interviewed her.'

Grilling: Following the 2002, split, Britney was widely portrayed as the villainess and even Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her, 'What did you do?'

Penned another fan of the star: 'Diane Sawyer literally tried to defend a woman who said 'If it wasn't illegal to shoot Britney I would' to Britney because Britney was wearing 'revealing' clothes and mothers are worried about their children because of it? LIKE WTF???'

However, some fans jumped to former NSYNC frontman Justin's defence, explaining that he was also young at the time of his split from Britney.

Explaining their stance, one wrote: 'All this Justin and Britney shit was way too much for two young ppl. They were way too young for ppl to have so much expectations and so much judgement. #FreeBritney (sic)'

'Am I the only Britney fan who also loves Justin Timberlake?' queried another. I get he should have apologized for things he said but sometimes if the two parties involved have no ill will, doesn't mean we have to put ourselves between their issue. She has moved on.'

Iconic relationship: Britney found herself in crisis when Justin blamed her for the breakup in his single Cry Me A River

Defence: However, some fans jumped to former NSYNC frontman Justin's defence, explaining that he was also young at the time of his split from Britney

Wrote a third: 'I love @jtimberlake but in all honesty. He wouldn't have had anything to write about for his 1st album if it wasn't for the breakup with @britneyspears & @Pharrell giving him most of @michaeljackson demo songs. #JustSayThankYou'

The pair first denied they had broken up for weeks despite rumours suggesting they had, with Britney confirming she was single a few days after their latest denial.

At the time of Britney and Justin's split, it was rumoured that she had cheated on the pop heartthrob with dancer Wade Robson, now 38.

However, it has also been claimed that Justin cheated on Britney multiple times in the year leading up to them calling time on their ill-fated romance.

In the years following the couple's breakup, Britney would endure a very public unravelling, that culminated in her shaving off her hair in early 2007.

Shortly afterwards, she was placed under a conservatorship, handled by her father Jamie, which she remains under to this day – despite trying to fight it.",Britney Spears and ex Justin Timberlake paint on smiles at the 2002 Super Bowl in unseen snaps

And Diane Keaton didn't disappoint on Saturday when she stepped out for some fresh air with her Golden Retriever Reggie by her side.

The 75-year-old Oscar winner bundled up in a long black overcoat while taking a walk in coastal Santa Monica.

Out on the town: Diane Keaton, 75, was spotted out in Santa Monica on Saturday as she took her Golden Retriever Reggie for a walk

Keaton stayed on theme with a black turtleneck that was tucked into her high-waisted black-and-white gingham pants.

She contrasted that pattern with a set of black polka-dotted shoes, and the headwear aficionado sported a stately wide-brimmed black hat.

She blocked out the sun with black sunglasses and had her black mask pulled down below her mouth, though she kept plenty of distance between herself and others.

Style icon: Keaton looked chic in a black overcoat, gingham slacks and a wide-brimmed black hat

As with many Hollywood stars, Keaton's career has slowed down amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

However, her romantic comedy Love, Weddings & Other Disasters was released in December.

The movie, which was shot prior to the start of the pandemic, featured a convoluted plot in which Keaton's character was dumped by her boyfriend in the middle of a sky-diving jump, just before she accidentally lands on a TV news reporter in the midst of his wedding ceremony

After being dubbed the 'wedding crasher,' she's hired as a wedding planner for a mayoral candidate (Jeremy Irons).

The film, from the director of Happy Gilmore and Jack And Jill, was lambasted by critics and sports a four-percent rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Whoops! She stars with Jeremy Irons as a woman who gets dumped during a skydiving jump, before she lands in the middle of a wedding ceremony; still from Love, Weddings & Other Disasters

Despite the low ratings, Keaton recently reevaluated another one of her critically under appreciated films.

Late last year, the actress looked back on her role in Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather Part III, which was reedited by the filmmaker and retitled as Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.

'It was one of the best moments of my life to watch it,' Keaton enthused to Variety after seeing the film at a private screening Coppola put on at the Paramount lot for herself and her original costars Al Pacino, Talia Shire and George Hamilton.

'To me it was a dream come true. I saw the movie in a completely different light,' she continued

Career high: 'It was one of the best moments of my life to watch it,' Keaton enthused to Variety late last year after a screening of Francis Ford Coppola's recut version of The Godfather Part III

'When I saw it way back, it was like ""Oh, I don’t know."" It didn’t seem to do that well and the reviews weren’t great. But Francis restructured the beginning and the end and man, I’m telling you it worked.'

Although the film was a commercial success, earning nearly $137 million against a $54 million budget, many critics were unimpressed with it, particularly compared to the first two Godfather films, which are widely regarded as masterpieces.

Keaton was among the crowd who didn't originally care for the Godfather finale.

'I don’t know why people didn’t appreciate it, but I was one of them,' she admitted. 'What was wrong with me? Why didn’t I like this before? But I didn’t. I kind of just dismissed it and thought, ""oh well.""'",Diane Keaton is effortlessly cool during walk in Santa Monica with her Golden Retriever Reggie

But it appears the Marvel superhero has had a minor setback, suffering from an acute back injury in the past few weeks.

According to Sunday Confidential, Chris, 37, recently sought treatment at a private hospital on Queensland's Gold Coast, near his home base in Byron Bay.

Is everything OK? Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth, 37, (PICTURED) has sought specialist treatment at a Gold Coast hospital for a 'severe back injury' in recent weeks as filming continues for Thor: Love and Thunder

Chris has been bulking up with intense training for both his fourth Thor movie, and an upcoming biopic for WWE wrestling royalty Hulk Hogan.

The publication claimed it's unclear how Chris sustained the injury, but appeared to be on the mend.

It's believed Chris' severe back pain and swelling was seen to by 'specialist doctors', who administered cortisone injections into the Australian actor's back.

It's understand the hospital visit was kept brief, and Chris was not required to stay overnight after the treatment.

Chris previously has spoken about his back troubles, having told Men's Health UK in March 2019 that he had to change up his training and nutrition to stop the injuries becoming 'a drag' while training for and filming the Thor movies.

Chris told the publication at the time: 'On certain days, when I’ve had a few injuries – and I had quite a few during Thor – it can start to become a drag, you know? But over the past year or so, I changed up a lot of my training and nutrition program, and I feel the best I’ve ever felt.'

'I’ve found that, after lifting weights for so long and not getting in touch with my fast-twitch fibres, the snappiness that my body had [has gone]. In the dads’ race at my kid’s school last year, I hadn’t sprinted in about five years – then, boom, you go and do a 100m sprint at full pelt. My back was cranked for weeks,' he admitted.

'I need to do some more sprint work, I guess. It just hurts. Running is painful. I don’t do a lot of running for that reason. I’d rather have mobility in my body from surfing and get that fluidity that I enjoy,' Chris said.

Chris and Spanish actress wife Elsa Pataky both have filming commitments in Sydney at the moment for separate projects.

The Hollywood couple have so far managed to fly back and forth from New South Wales' capital city to their coastal home of Byron Bay to be with their three children in between filming dates on set.

The Sussexes, who now live in the Golden State, took part in a virtual hour-long meeting with the Democratic governor back on October 19, according to a memo obtained by The Sun.

It is not clear what was discussed in the meeting with Newsom's office telling the outlet it does not comment on 'the content of meetings between the Governor and private parties or his staff.'

At the time, the presidential election was just two weeks away and Newsom was facing mounting calls to line up a woman of color to replace then-California Senator Kamala Harris if she was elected vice president.

The alleged meeting between the former Royals and the prominent politician came after Meghan and Harry were accused of 'crossing the line' in September in a Time 100 video where they told American voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' in 'the most important election of our life.'

Members of the Royal family are supposed to be politically neutral.

Meghan and Harry stood down as senior Royals effective March 2020 but part of their agreement with Buckingham Palace was that 'everything they do will uphold the values of Her Majesty'.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry (pictured in a conference call from their home in October) are said to have held a secret 'introductory meeting' with California Governor Gavin Newsom in the run-up to the election - just weeks after the former Royals 'violated' the terms of their 'Megxit' deal by wading into politics

The Sussexes took part in a virtual hour-long meeting with the Democratic governor on October 19, according to a memo obtained by The Sun (above)

The memo seen by The Sun details a video conference from 3.00pm to 4.00 pm 'with Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.'

The topic of the meeting was simply listed as 'Introductory meeting' with the call taking place out of the governor's mansion in Sacramento, reported the outlet.

Newsom, who was once widely tipped for a future White House run, was facing calls at the time to pick a woman of color as Harris's prospective successor.

Some longtime state Democrats argued that if or when Harris would take office in DC, the Senate would be left with no black female members.

At least two black Representatives Barbara Lee and Karen Bass were in the running but the governor later named California’s Secretary of State Alex Padilla, making him the first Hispanic senator.

News of the alleged secret meeting risks increasing tensions further between the Sussexes and Buckingham Palace after the couple sparked a row in September over their politically-charged comments.

Meghan and Harry broke with Royal convention when they released a video message making thinly-veiled digs at Donald Trump.

In the video, which came in a Time 100 video to go with the publication of the 2020 list of the most influential people, Harry urged Americans to 'reject hate speech' while Meghan called it the 'most important election of our lifetime'.

'As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,' said Harry – in a line many observers regarded as a swipe at Trump.

'When the bad outweighs the good, for many, whether we realize it or not, it erodes our ability to have compassion and our ability to put ourself in someone else's shoes. Because when one person buys into negativity online, the effects are felt exponentially. It's time to not only reflect, but act,' he said.

Meghan, who was born in California, encouraged viewers to vote telling them it was the 'most important' election.

'We're six weeks out from the election, and today is Voter Registration Day,' she said.

'Every four years, we're told the same thing, 'This is the most important election of our lifetime.

'But this one is. When we vote, our values are put into action, and our voices are heard.'

The message was widely seen as an attack on Trump and support for Joe Biden, breaking with centuries-old tradition for members of the Royal family to remain politically neutral.

Buckingham Palace sought to distance itself from Harry's remarks saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the royal family' and that his comments were 'made in a personal capacity'.

But senior Royal aides said their comments had 'violated' the terms of the 'Megxit' deal they struck with the Queen when they quit Royal life and moved across the pond.

'The [royal] family are all wringing their hands, thinking: where is this going and does this abide by the deal to uphold the values of the Queen? The feeling is it's a violation of the agreement,' a source told The Sunday Times.

Royal sources said the couple had 'crossed a line' and embarrassed the Queen, by potentially creating problems for the monarch if Trump was elected for a second term.

'If Trump is re-elected and makes another visit here, what is the Queen supposed to say when her grandson and his wife have effectively campaigned against him?' said a source.

Trump also hit back at the couple over the comments saying he was 'not a fan of hers' and that he 'wish[ed] a lot of luck to Harry because he's going to need it.'

'The Duke's message is not in reference to any specific political party or candidate, but is instead a call for decency in how we engage with each other,' they said at the time.

Meghan voted early in the presidential election by mail-in ballot, sources said in November.

Though no longer officially a Royal, she is the first person with such close attachment to the monarchy to take part in a US election in modern history.

As Harry is not a US citizen he could not take part in the election.

Meghan is also rumored to be mulling a political career of her own - even aiming for the top job in the White House.

A source close to the couple told Vanity Fair last year she was 'seriously considering running for president' if they 'ever gave up their titles and that this was one of the reasons she 'was so keen not to give up her American citizenship.'

However, other insiders have denied the claims saying she has 'no ambition' to enter politics as a career.

But Tom Brady can end all talk of him becoming the greatest of all time. With six rings that accolade firmly belongs to Brady, whose Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in Super Bowl LV.

For Mahomes - and any quarterback – the legacy of Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jnr looms large.

He was six when Brady led the New England Patriots to their first title 19 years ago. But if the Chiefs win, Mahomes, 25, will be the youngest quarterback to win two Super Bowls - and the first since Brady in 2005 to go back-to-back.

Patrick Mahomes is the perfect quarterback, but he comes up against a legend in Tom Brady

Mahomes is 44-9 as starter, including the playoffs. He is magnificent. A dual threat quarterback without a weakness: a leader, an innovator, and one of only 13 men to win a regular season and Super Bowl MVP.

His achievements are equally impressive off the field.

He speaks out about social injustice and police brutality and urged team-mates and fans to register to vote in the US election. He works tirelessly for his local community in Kansas City and his foundation supports children's causes.

Time magazine listed him as one of 'The 100 Most Influential People of 2020'. He's on his way to becoming the most powerful athlete on the planet.

'When you're given a platform like I've been given, you want to try and use it and make the world a better place. I truly mean that when I say that,' he said.

'I don't know if they make a better human,' team-mate Travis Kelce said. 'Talk about somebody that wants to be in the community and make things better for everybody, make things easier on those that have had it harder in life.'

Brady is happier to stick to sport. After displaying a MAGA cap in his locker in 2015 he circumnavigated a question about his support for Trump this week.

But in September he did say this: 'Being in the locker room for 20 years and being around guys with every different race, religion, skin colour, background and different states. Everyone [brings] something different to the table and you embrace those things. They expand you in ways that you couldn't have been expanded if you weren't exposed to all those different things.'

With six Super Bowl rings to his name, Brady is rightly hailed as the greatest of all time

Sunday's meeting is the fifth between the pair. The record is 2-2 with each game decided by one score.

Two years ago in the AFC Championship game, Brady and the Patriots won 37-31, courtesy of an overtime touchdown. It sent the Patriots into a third straight Super Bowl and Brady's ninth.

Brady went out of his way to talk to the first-year starter after the game, making the unprecedented step of asking security staff to usher him into the Chiefs locker room at Foxboro.

'I just wanted to make sure before he left that you let him know what I thought about watching him play all year,' said Brady.

'Him saying that he respected what I was doing and how I was playing on the field and the type of person I was, it kind of put a stamp on me that I needed to go in and even be better in order to get to the Super Bowl,' Mahomes said.

Sunday's meeting is Brady and Mahomes' fifth. It's 2-2 with each game decided by one score

Brady, at 43 the NFL's oldest active player, has been arriving at Tampa Bay's facility at 6.15am this week, which caps a remarkable year.

Eyebrows were raised in March as he agreed to join the Bucs, a 7-9 team which hadn't reached the playoffs since 2007, to 'see how great I can be'.

While on the phone to general manager Jason Licht and head coach Bruce Arians, Brady asked for the phone numbers of all his team-mates.

He knew the exact amount of hours until the season-opener with the New Orleans Saints. Time was of the essence.

'The belief he gave to this organisation that it could be done,' Arians said. 'It only took one man.'

Mahomes signed a new contract in July while Brady, 43, shows no signs of slowing down either

After losing 27-24 to the Chiefs on November 29, the Bucs were 7-5. Since then, they've won seven in a row.

And while Mahomes is staying in Kansas City after signing a $503million, 10-year extension in July, there is no sign of Brady slowing down either.

After throwing for 4,633 yards in the regular season – the fifth highest tally his career – he said this week: 'I think next year is going to be a lot better than this year,'

'I feel like I'll be in a much better place mentally. I'm going to train a lot better – physically next year I'll be in a better place. I know as soon as this game ends, we're on to next season.'",Super Bowl: Chiefs' star Patrick Mahomes faces off against NFL great Tom Brady

The former England football captain is believed to have been offered at least £10 million to be the country’s ambassador, with a major role in promoting next year’s World Cup there.

But Beckham, who in 2007 announced he was ‘very honoured to have the tag of gay icon’, risks condemnation for cutting a deal with a country where homosexuality is illegal and, under sharia law, punishable by imprisonment, flogging or even death.

David Beckham with Nasser-Al Khelaifi at a game in Qatar in 2019. But Beckham, who in 2007 announced he was ‘very honoured to have the tag of gay icon’, risks condemnation for cutting a deal with a country where homosexuality is illegal

Sources close to the deal are understood to be discussing a strategy to announce an agreement, after concerns that Qatar’s poor image could tarnish the carefully cultivated Brand Beckham.

As well as claims of human rights abuses and corruption, the Middle East state’s treatment of gay people has led to it being named as the second most dangerous country to visit for the LGBTQ+ community. Sex outside of marriage for heterosexual couples also carries a prison sentence of seven years in jail.

Sources say, however, that Beckham, 45, has been assured that the country is relaxing its policy on such issues.

Talks between Beckham’s advisers and the Qatari committee in charge of World Cup preparations have been ongoing for more than a year. After discussing options, including the sponsorship of his US soccer team Inter Miami, they are believed to have settled on a personal deal with the star. One Qatari source said: ‘This is a deal that is supposed to be top secret. It is being kept quiet until there is an opportunity to land it without David’s PR being affected too much.

‘Well, that’s the hope anyway. Qatar are very much in his hands. There are concerns about his reputation but there is enough money on the table for the optics not to matter so much.

‘That said, it will be officially landed at an opportunistic time.’

Another source said: ‘David has so many big-money deals, you do wonder why he would want one like this.’

A major concern could be the reaction to any deal with Qatar among the ex-footballer’s numerous high-profile homosexual friends, including Sir Elton John, who hosts him on his yacht in the South of France every summer.

Beckham, who is worth an estimated £360 million, is known to be a frequent visitor to the Gulf state – he ended his playing career with Qatar-owned French team Paris Saint-Germain in 2013.

He is also close friends with the club’s president, Nasser-Al Khelaifi, and the pair have been seen together at football matches in recent years.

The star, who has been married to Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria for 21 years, has made no secret of his support for the forthcoming World Cup to take place in Qatar, despite the poor and dangerous working conditions of migrant staff working on the new stadiums where the matches will be held. Speaking in December 2019, he said: ‘That’s what the World Cup is all about – giving countries the chance to host the biggest competition in the game.

‘It changes economies, changes people’s lives, changes fan experiences and gives people an opportunity to experience football in places you wouldn’t expect to visit.

‘It’s given Qatar an opportunity to do something that’s so special and, as you see, something unique is really being created here.

‘There will be a lot of children in Qatar seeing their own national team playing games and saying “maybe that can be me one day”.’

Last year, there were various reports of a £150 million sponsorship deal between Qatar and US soccer team Inter Miami or the country buying a stake in the club, but neither came to fruition.

Boseman was 43 when he died on August 28, 2020, following a four-year battle with colon cancer.

The Black Panther star was diagnosed with Stage III colon cancer in 2016, and it later progressed.

At the time of his diagnosis, Boseman had already filmed his first appearance as T'Challa in 2016's Captain America: Civil War, and he would go on to play the Black Panther in his blockbuster 2018 solo film while reprising the role in Avengers: Infinity War later that year and again in Avengers: End Game in 2019, which became his final film as the superhero from Wakanda.

The film, which traces the impact of the Vietnam War on a group of Black veterans, currently holds a 92% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Boseman's final film performance was in the adaptation of August Wilson's play Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, which was released on Netflix in November.

His performance again received strong praise from critics.

In addition to his record-number of SAG nominations, Boseman also received his first-ever Golden Globe nomination for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, after previously being nominated for an NAACP Image Award, a Gotham Award and an Indie Spirit Award for the same role.

Shortly after Boseman's team revealed his death on social media in August, Jordan shared some of his thoughts on his Black Panther costar.

'I’ve been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug…everything. I wish we had more time,' he wrote.

She then called out cancel culture, saying it is 'the worst thing to come out of our digital world. It leaves no room for forgiveness and growth.'

She later added, 'I do not believe the pure hate he has received is beneficial to the situation in anyway. There is criticism he is receiving that is positive and educational -- this should continue to happen, as it will help him grow and learn from his mistake.

He apologized after he was heard on tape casually using the N-word with friends, saying 'There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever' but the ensuing scandal has nonetheless continued.

Wallen's music is now banned from iHeartMedia, Cumulus and and Entercom stations.

On Wednesday, his label Big Loud Records, said in a statement that it 'has made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely' after the shocking recording surfaced.

Republic Records, which he is co-signed to, said it agreed with Big Loud's decision and said 'such behavior will not be tolerated.'

Meanwhile, iHeart, the largest radio station group owner in the U.S. with more than 855 stations, has banned Wallen's music from the airwaves, as have other large radio station owners Cumulus Media and Entercom.

Wallen was seen onstage at the Ryman Auditorium on January 12 in Nashville. He is one of country's biggest young stars, but faces industry backlash after using a racial slur

'In light of Morgan Wallen's recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,' an iHeart spokesperson told Billboard.

Similarly, an Entercom representative told the magazine: 'In light of Morgan Wallen's recent use of a racial slur, we've discussed the incident with our country brand leadership team and together have made the decision to remove Morgan's music from Entercom's playlists.'

Cumulus Media, the nation's second largest chain of stations, was the first to ban Wallen's music. Together the companies run more than 1,500 radio stations.

A memo sent to Cumulus Media program directors read: 'Team, unfortunately country music star Morgan Wallen was captured on video Sunday evening using a racial slur. Effective immediately we request that all of Morgan Wallen's music be removed from our playlists without exception. More to follow.'

Wallen is one of the country genre's biggest young stars, with his new record, 'Dangerous: The Double Album,' spending three weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart, but the reaction from the music industry has been swift.

The backlash came after Wallen was heard on a recording made by a neighbor and made public Tuesday, using the slur as he chatted with friends while returning to his Music City home.

The Sneedville, Tennessee native's neighbor recorded the country artist as he came back to his house Sunday with friends, disturbing neighbors with loud noise and car horns.

'I'm embarrassed and sorry,' the country music artist, 27, told TMZ Tuesday. 'I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back.'

He continued, 'There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.'

As of Wednesday morning, streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music also don't have his songs in their most popular country music playlists, where normally Wallen had multiple songs from his new album.

The Tennessee-born singer has done a lot of public apologizing lately.

Wallen was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct in May 2020 after getting kicked out of a downtown Nashville bar.

Wallen also made headlines last fall after his Saturday Night Live appearance was canceled after he broke protocols the show had in place amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The country music industry faced harsh criticism on Twitter for propping up the performer amid a number of incidents prior to the latest

Wallen was seen in a TikTok clip not wearing a mask on two separate instances in Alabama, a bar and a party.

The Way I Talk singer issued an apology after he was scratched from performing on the NBC juggernaut, saying his actions were 'pretty short-sighted' and that he understood the reason why he was cut.

'I respect the show's decision because I know that I put them in jeopardy and I take ownership for this,' said the 7 Summers performer, who was replaced by Jack White on the October broadcast.

Wallen told Entertainment Tonight after the incident said he has a better understanding of how to navigate life in the limelight.

'I think I just gotta be aware that most of my actions... will be brought to light,' Wallen said. 'I don't think I really truly understood the reach that I have.'

He subsequently appeared on the show later last year and appeared in a skit making fun of himself.

Other country stars criticized his actions publicly in light of the offensive recording that surfaced this week.

'It actually IS representative of our town because this isn´t his first `scuffle´ and he just demolished a huge streaming record last month regardless,' tweeted country star Maren Morris.

And the twice Wimbledon champion is convinced that lax protocols at National Tennis Centre are to blame for the positive Covid test which prevented him making the trip Down Under.

In another embarrassment for the Lawn Tennis Association, Britain's greatest player believes a slackening of rules at Roehampton around the New Year period led to him contracting the virus.

Andy Murray has blamed lax rules at the National Tennis Centre at New Year for his Covid woes

That in turn led to other close family members being infected and ended his hopes of returning to Melbourne, two years after he feared his career was over.

His view is in line with others who were around the NTC during that time, who attest that excessive numbers of people were allowed in to practice, and that the player lounge, in particular, exhibited a lack of social distancing.

An outbreak of Covid ensued, and Murray's frustration was compounded by him having been ultra careful to ensure he was healthy ahead of the long journey to Australia.

'My feeling is that we stuck to all the protocols,' said the 33 year-old Scot. 'I know that none of my team have had the virus.

'I was the only one to pick it up and none of my family had it before, so I brought it to them. The only two places I went to were the National Tennis Centre and my house, so I know where I got it from.

'I have an electric car so I didn't even stop at any petrol stations on the way there.'

The NTC managed to stay bio secure until the very end of 2020, and protocols have been tightened again since the outbreak, which Britain's greatest player acknowledged.

'After Christmas you obviously have an indoor venue where they are using all six courts, there were tons of people in the gym and it was just totally different. Now it's kind of back to what it was in April, which is good.

'The player lounge, which was there for the players to go and relax in, that's shut now, all the players and staff are now getting tested which is good, but that wasn't in place beforehand.

'Obviously people were coming back from the festive period, from different parts of the country which had different tiering systems.

Many believe too many people were allowed to practice at Roehampton in the New Year period

'Over that period there wasn't really much testing going on when people were coming in post Christmas time. That was when there was the outbreak.'

So Murray will now make his comeback next week amid an unusually strong field at the €44,000 Challenger event in the small city of Biella.

Even more infuriatingly, he had been hugely encouraged by the progress made in recent months, with his hip issues having settled down.

'I still am gutted about it, when I'm sitting in my hotel room here healthy and fit and ready to play and compete, seeing the tournaments going on down there,' he said.

'It's tough, because I'd prepared really well, it had probably been the best 2 or 3 months training that I'd done in the last few years. The body was responding really well, I felt like I was in a very good place.'

Although fully recovered after only a minor bout of the disease, he accepted that ultimately it was not practical to go to Melbourne.

'I wasn't angry that I wasn't able to go, I know they've done a brilliant job down there controlling the virus, and the players are very fortunate they're able to play, so I wasn't angry at the Australians. But I felt like because I'd had the virus, I was therefore not infectious and wouldn't be posing any risk to anyone.'

Murray said he is 'still gutted' that he can't play at the Australian Open despite feeling ready

His situation raises more questions about the competence of the LTA, who under Chief Executive Scott Lloyd have spent more than £1million upgrading the NTC.

A spokesperson for the organisation defended their record in Covid controls at Roehampton, which has staged 17 tournaments during the pandemic.

'We have consistently applied the stringent and appropriate restrictions, testing and other protocols for elite training centres in line with government guidance,' he said.

'Out protocols are regularly communicated to everyone using the venue and we expected them to be adhered to in the player lounge and all other area of the building. It is impossible for LTA staff to police every part of the building continuously and ultimately individuals are responsible for their own behaviour.'",Andy Murray 'still gutted' over missing Australian Open because of coronavirus

Christina added in the caption of the video, 'Chill people - I eat, and I eat healthy.'

This comes after Ant admitted he had lost over 20lbs after his fans noticed his slimmed down physique.

The 41-year-old British host revealed in October he had dropped around '23lbs'.

'Don't worry I will get it back on,' he told fans, adding a bicep and a pig emoji.

Christina announced in September that she had split from Ant after less than two years of marriage.

Before filing for divorce in November she reflected on her new direction in life.

'I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two. I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies - but sometimes life throws us curve balls,' she wrote.

'Instead of getting stuck in these 'setbacks' I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow.

'So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I'm messy, I'm real and I'm working on healing.'",Christina Anstead hits back at weight comments as fans accuse her of being too skinny

The 31-year-old was targeted by online trolls who felt Michaela Coel had been unfairly overlooked for her role in the ground-breaking BBC drama I May Destroy You.

In a barrage of social media posts, they claimed that Ms Collins was shortlisted because she is white, while Ms Coel missed out because she is black. Cyber-bullies also alleged that Ms Collins was nominated simply because she has a famous father – pop star Phil Collins.

Netflix’s Emily In Paris is also up for best comedy series, but the critically acclaimed I May Destroy You did not receive any nominations. Within minutes of the Hollywood shortlists being revealed last Wednesday, Twitter users were alleging racism. One wrote: ‘If you don’t think white supremacy is real, Emily In Paris is nominated for a Golden Globe.’

Emily In Paris star Lily Collins (pictured) has found herself at the centre of a race storm after she was nominated for a prestigious Golden Globe award ahead of a black actress

Another said: ‘What people don’t understand about racism is that it’s not a by-product. The globes panel didn’t nominate I May Destroy You because they didn’t think it was good because Michaela is black and thought Emily In Paris was good because Lily Collins is white. They KNOW which was better!’

And another added that ‘Lily Collins being here is pure nepotism and racism.’ One even outrageously made the false claim that Ms Collins had paid for her nomination.

Ms Collins has previously acknowledged her privilege. Amid protests over the death of George Floyd after he was restrained by police in Minneapolis last year, she wrote: ‘I am white, I am privileged. I will never experience what black people in America go through every single day, but I am listening and I am learning. I march with you and will fight with you.’

She is also a celebrity ambassador for Bystander Revolution, the anti-bullying organisation set up by MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

In an irony that may have been lost on the trolls, Ms Collins and Ms Coel would never have been vying for the same prize anyway as Emily In Paris is eligible in the musical or comedy categories, while I May Destroy You falls under the drama section.

Cyber-bullies also alleged that Ms Collins was nominated simply because she has a famous father – pop star Phil Collins (pictured)

Amid the backlash the actress stepped out with her fiancé Charlie McDowell in Pasadena on Saturday

Lily wore a low-key tan jacket over a plain white shirt that was tied off above her midriff and high-waisted jeans

Meanwhile, Emily In Paris writer Deborah Copaken may have inadvertently fuelled the backlash against her own show’s star when she also took to Twitter to tell of her own shock at Ms Coel’s failure to secure a nomination.

Addressing the actress, she said: ‘I was a writer on Emily In Paris, but your show was my favourite show since the dawn of TV and this is just wrong. I loved I May Destroy You, and I thank you personally for giving us your heart, your mind, your resilience and your humour.’

The ten-part Emily In Paris, which was hailed by some as the natural successor to Sex And The City, features an American who moves to the French capital to work for a marketing firm.

On Friday evening however, the 22-year-old model daughter of Lionel Richie - who is reportedly 'still single' - was spotted grabbing dinner with her long-time friend Jaden Smith, 22, in Santa Monica.

The pair stepped out after a grabbing a table for two at Giorgio Baldi amid LA County's newly reopened outdoor dining, after Smith and Richie said in the past that they are 'just friends.'

The singer-actor son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett kept it casual in distressed jeans with painted accents and a bomber jacket over a hoodie, throwing on a pair of fresh white New Balances.

Both were suited up in face masks for the outing, continuing to protect themselves from the relentless COVID-19 virus following a major spike and two month stay-at-home order in LA.

When the pair were first spotted getting a bit handsy on the beach on Labor Day weekend, many were quick to guess that there was a budding romance.

Both shutdown any speculation that their 10 plus year friendship was anything more, with Smith telling Ryan Seacrest on his iHeartRadio show, 'We're just homies and we love each other.'

He also added that the longtime pals have been going to the beach together for nearly a decade, calling the day in question pure 'fun.'

Since breaking things off with 37-year-old Disick in August following a three year romance, Richie has been shooting her shot on the dating scene as she was in a brief tryst with Hard Rock Hotel heir Matthew Morton in the fall and recently Ofer.

A celebrity in her own right, she seems to have developed a taste for wealthy heirs as Ofer is the son of Israeli-born Tanker Pacific founder Idan Ofer, who according to Forbes is the 494th richest man in the world with a net worth of just over $5 Billion.

The two were seen sharing a smooch session in South Beach days ago, but the romance seemed to be a matter of convenience as the Harvard graduate is currently pursuing his MBA at London Business School.

Unattached: Since breaking off her nearly three year romance with Disick over the summer she has been linked to Morton and Ofer, also grabbing dinner Thursday night at Nobu with a mystery man

On Thursday night she proved that she is still largely unattached as she grabbed dinner at hotspot Nobu with a mystery man, climbing into the passenger seat of his black Ferrari shortly thereafter.

A source told E! News on Friday that she is very much 'single' and just playing the field.

'She's been seeing a few people and is truly having fun right now. She doesn't want to be tied down in a relationship and is keeping her options open. She's been going on dates with a few people and her friends have been trying to set her up,' the insider said.

The source also confirmed that Ofer was a 'casual' fling, adding 'They've gone on a few dates and she likes him but she truly doesn't want anything serious.'

'Sometimes we outgrow people we used to know and become different people. When this growth happens, some take our changes personally. Not because they have anything against us but because they do not recognize the person that we are now (sic).'

Ira Rosen, who has worked at 60 Minutes and 20/20 over the span of four decades, makes several scathing assessments in his tome Ticking Clock, set for release on February 16.

Rosen brands Diane Sawyer as 'two-faced', Katie Couric as 'lazy' and 'Chris Cuomo as 'entitled' in excerpts of the book obtained by The New York Post.

The Emmy Award winning producer also reveals a secret rivalry between Sawyer and her female co-anchor Barbara Walters, as well as a bitter yearlong feud between father and son newsmen Mike and Chris Wallace.

A former TV producer is spilling secrets about America's most famous news anchors in an explosive new memoir. Ira Rosen, who has worked at 60 Minutes and 20/20 over the span of four decades, alleges Diane Sawyer and Babara Walters were locked in a bitter rivalry while working together at ABC. The pair are pictured in 1998

Rosen also alleges there was a bitter yearlong feud between father and son newsmen Mike and Chris Wallace. The Wallaces are pictured together in 2005

Rosen worked with Katie Couric during her five-year stint on 60 Minutes from 2006 and 2010. In his new book he describes her as 'lazy and disengaged'

Rosen (right) has won dozens of Emmy Awards over his illustrious 40-year career. He is pictured with 60 Minutes anchor Bill Whitaker in 2016

Rosen began his career in the TV news business back in 1980 when he landed a job at 60 Minutes.

There, he began a fractious long-term professional partnership with co-anchor Mike Wallace.

Wallace was regarded as one of the top TV journalists in the world, but Rosen claims that the anchor 'seemed to define his life by how much trouble he could cause'.

According to The Post, Wallace 'was notorious for his 'Neanderthal behavior' toward women, snapping their bra straps and slapping their bottoms.'

Rosen writes that one female produced even smacked Wallace across the face after an alleged advance.

Meanwhile, Wallace reportedly relished picking fights with his co-workers, regularly stealing stories from fellow anchors Ed Bradley and Morley Safer.

'Months would go by in which Safer would not speak to Wallace, even though their offices were next door to each other,' Rosen writes.

Wallace (center) is pictured with his 60 Minutes colleagues in a cast photo taken in 1988. Morley Safer is pictured at far right

According to Rosen, Wallace also stole stories from his own son, Chris, who has now become a famed TV news anchor in his own right.

In 1997, Chris Wallace reportedly secured an interview with comedian Chris Rock while he was working at ABC.

However, Mike Wallace allegedly lured Rock into doing the interview with him over on 60 Minutes, telling the comedian that his show had better ratings than his son's.

Rosen says the younger Wallace was so hurt by his father's move that they did not speak for an entire year.

Sawyer worked at ABC alongside Barbara Walters, where the pair publicly professed their admiration for one another. They are pictured in 1994

Sawyer and Walters are seen in 2014. Despite a public friendship, the pair were often in fierce competition with each other, Rosen contends

Meanwhile, Rosen also worked closely with Diane Sawyer, and describes her in his new memoir as 'two-faced'.

'If she was overly friendly and began to kiss you on the cheeks to say hello, chances are she was trashing you behind your back,' Rosen writes.

Sawyer worked at ABC alongside Barbara Walters, where the pair publicly professed their admiration for one another.

But behind the scenes, the two were often far from friendly, according to Rosen.

He writes that, in one instance, Sawyer smiled as she greeted Walters before entering an elevator and stating: 'I hate that woman. Don't believe a word she says. She knifes me any chance she gets'.

The two women were paired together to host a 20/20 Sunday at ABC in the late 1990s, but the situation reportedly devolved as they competed over who got the most airtime.

'They even counted the number of words each one had, introducing the stories. It was a total disaster,' Rosen claims.

The New York Post reports that Rosen found Cuomo 'entitled' and displaying 'caustic arrogance' when they met in 2003

Meanwhile, in 2003, Rosen met Chris Cuomo, who had begun working at ABC.

The New York Post reports that Rosen found Cuomo 'entitled' and displaying 'caustic arrogance'.

Cuomo's father once served as Governor of New York, and his famous surname no doubt helped contribute to his confidence.

Rosen - who by that point had acquired two decades of experience in the news business - was asked to help mentor Cuomo, who was new to industry.

But Cuomo allegedly greeted Rosen by stating: 'I understand that you are my new b***h.' '

'He lost me at hello,' Rosen writes in his tome.

Rosen claims Couric opted for a softball style while interviewing Hillary Clinton as she ran for president in 2008. The pair are pictured four years earlier in 2004

But, perhaps, Rosen reserves his most scathing assessment for Katie Couric, who worked at 60 Minutes from 2006 - 2011.

'[Couric was] lazy and disengaged, and thought she was smarter than all of us. She wasn't,' he tartly writes.

He claims Couric opted for softball questions while interviewing Hillary Clinton as she ran for president in 2008.

The decision angered Rosen, who was producing the segment.

'I kept thinking, 'For this, they are paying Katie $15 million a year?' he writes.

Rosen is still working in the news business at the age of 66, and appears to thrive on the behind-the-scenes drama and the antics of America's most famous anchors.

'I'd rather work with a talented a**hole than a nice person without talent,' he concludes in Ticking Clock.

The 14-year-old girl looked nearly identical to her late mother in newly filmed footage as she retraced her mother's roots while on a road trip with her father Larry Birkhead, 48.

The special, Tragic Beauty, juxtaposes Birkhead's trip with Smith's life story, which came to an end on February 8, 2007, from a drug overdose when she was only 39.

Dannielynn was only five months old at the time of her mother's death.

The teen's journey takes her and her father back to Anna's early homes in Texas.

The blond beauty was born in Houston and spent her early school years there, but she moved to the small town of Mexia to live with her grandmother when she started high school.

The father–daughter duo also visited some of Anna's favorite places around Los Angeles.

'Dannielynn's a teenager now, and she doesn't really know a ton of things about her mom,' Larry says to explain his trip.

'Anna should be remembered as this larger-than-life figure that was really a caring, giving person, a beautiful lady who loved her fans and loved her family.'

As part of his goal of remember the model at her best, Larry kept many of her prized possessions in a storage locker, which he and his daughter go through.

In addition to scenes featuring Dannielynn and Larry, the documentary also has extensive interviews with friends of Anna, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Hogan.

Anna's friend Frankie Rodriguez says in the special that there were constantly 'two people' battling within the early reality star.

'There was Vickie Lynn Marshall and Anna Nicole Smith,' he explains. 'Any kinda camera, you just yelled out her name, ""Anna Nicole."" When she turned around, it was on the spot; you saw Anna Nicole.

'The minute that camera left, it was a whole other person. She was back to Vickie Lynn,' he continued. 'I [am] very fortunate to have met and gotten to know Vickie Lynn… How she did it, I don't know. But whatever she was doing, it was making everybody watch.'

The special features reporting by ABC News Senior National Affairs Correspondent Deborah Roberts, the two-hour program takes a 'comprehensive look at Anna Nicole through new interviews with those closest to her, never-before-seen and rarely seen video, as well as material from the ABC News archives.'

20/20 also reports on the 'dichotomy between who Anna Nicole was in the spotlight and who she was in private as Vickie Lynn Smith, her rise to fame, life in the limelight, her tragic death in Florida and the unanswered questions about her death,' the statement shared.

One year ago Birkhead was featured in the new Lifetime movie Hopelessly in Love: Anna Nicole Smith and Larry Birkhead.

During the special he revealed the last thing that the Playboy pinup told him.

'She sent me an [instant message on AOL Instant Messenger]. She said, ""Don’t fall in love again,""' he confessed. 'And then she had a crying face and then she signed off. That’s the last time I spoke to her.'

At the time, the Guess model was pregnant with their daughter Dannielynn.

Smith was in the Bahamas to get away from public attention.

The way they were: Anna and Larry at the races when they were still in a relationship

'My goal at the time was to try to get her to come back to the U.S. from the Bahamas, and I had almost got her to that place of saying that she would do it,' he told Fox News.

'We still had that connection and she was really more curious about what I was doing at the time, the last time I spoke with her. I told her that I was going on a tour with a country artist, this female country artist.

'She wanted to know all about her,' he added.

'""Who is she, what does she look like?"" It was one of those things where she was kind of getting a little jealous about it and she started crying about it,' he said.

'And that same day she had to go to the emergency room because she was so upset. She actually gave birth early to my daughter because of her getting so upset at that time.'

That is when she sent him the 'Don’t fall in love again' message.

Dannielynn was born on September 7, 2006.

Three days later Smith’s 20-year-old son Daniel — who had a different father — died suddenly from an accidental drug overdose.

He just happened to be visiting Anna and Dannielynn at the hospital.

Larry and Anna met at the Kentucky Derby in 2003. When they met again a year later at the same Derby, they clicked. 'In my mind I thought, there's no way Anna Nicole, who could have her pick of any guy in here, is interested in me,' he relayed.

He then met up with her in Nebraska for an event.

Her husband: She went from model to heiress after marrying oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall, who was 63 years her senior, in 1994

'It wasn't a red carpet event, it was more her one on one with the kids and she was a different person,' he said. 'This was not wild, wacky zany Anna Nicole. It's someone who had more of a purpose to them than being a punchline on television.'

Their first kiss was 'surreal.'

'The first night I was alone with Anna, she told me she thought I was an angel sent to help her,' he said.

They went on vacation in 2005 but 'that thing went downhill fast' because he was spending time with a friend who 'kind of looked like Marilyn Monroe.'

'I think Anna just got jealous, Anna thought it was competition,' he said.

They were off and on until she got pregnant.

He also said that earlier she had a miscarriage probably because her overall health was not good.

Sad loss: Smith’s 20-year-old son Daniel - who had a different father - died suddenly from an accidental drug overdose. Seen in 1999

'She had seizures and she would get migraines, her hands would swell, she would have back pain because of her breast implant surgery,' said Larry.

'There was always something she would take. I questioned it early on, like, You're taking a lot of medicine. She was like, You don't understand, assured me everything was great, but I was still worried.'

When she became pregnant with Dannielynn, she 'was talking to her doctor and her doctor said, 'No, you have to stay on these medicines, if you don't you can go into a seizure and lose the baby,' said Larry.

Anna also told him to not talk about her pregnancy.

'I couldn't say a word to anybody because the last thing she thought people wanted to see was a pregnant diet pill spokesperson,' he said.

At the time she was a rep for TrimSpa.

'It was eating me up, we went months without being able to say anything,' he said.

Her lawyer Howard K Stern seemed to get in the way, making sure paparazzi photos of Anna and Larry did not get out.

Larry also says he and Anne were talking about marriage. They got in a fight, however, and Anna went to the Bahamas. It was the last time Larry saw her alive.

'It was almost scripted,' said Larry, 'She was like, ""I'm not coming back home and this isn't your baby."" That was like a knife going through me.'

But they still talked.

Anna died of an overdose in a Florida hotel room. Larry found out while watching TV in his dentist's office.

'I was in denial about it, I said, I think I can fix this, I think I can fix this. I want to get on a plane, I can fix this,' he remembered thinking.

The funeral took place in the Bahamas in March. 'It was sad, just to see her laying there. She had a pink dress on, a tiara,' he said. 'We were all asked to write, if we wanted to, something to put in the casket. I told her in the note I was going to take care of our daughter and I listed some of the things we did, the fun times, some of the songs we listened to and I just poured it all out. Put the note in the casket, they lowered the casket down and that was it.'",Anna Nicole Smith's daughter Dannielynn Birkhead looks identical to her mother in new 20/20 special

'We weren't as present in the black and white era,' she continued. 'A lot of filmmakers have already done this before, a lot of Black filmmakers, so it's not necessarily a new idea, but we did want to pay tribute to that era and reclaim that beauty and that elegance with these two Black actors.'

The 24-year-old actress said she was anxious prior to the film - which she stars in with John David Washington - drops on the streaming service.

'Full of excitement and nervousness as this lil movie we made in lockdown with people I love is coming out in the next hour,' the Oakland-born beauty said.

'Nervousness for a few reasons. Normally I'm pretty self-critical and that leads me to be far too fearful to make things myself or trust myself enough to... even try.'

Millions of words may have been written about his jam-packed life, but a new book by veteran Royal-watcher IAN LLOYD unearths nuggets about the man who, with characteristic self-deprecation, has even invented a word for his famous habit of ‘putting one’s foot into one’s mouth’…

1 Mon Repos was the Corfu villa where, on June 10, 1921, Princess Alice, 36, had her fifth child. Her doctor thought it more expedient for her to give birth on the dining room table rather than in her bed.

2 His mother’s childhood nickname for him was ‘Bubbikins’.

3 He’s Queen Victoria’s oldest surviving great-great-grandchild.

4 Thirty years ago, he said: ‘I’m not really interested in what goes on my tombstone.’

5 Watching the Queen Mother in her centenary year, he declared: ‘God, I don’t want to live to be 100. I can’t imagine anything worse.’

6 He has described his ‘dontopedalogy’ as ‘the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it’.

7 Once asked which country he’d still like to visit, he replied: ‘Russia – although the bastards murdered half my family.’

8 His paternal grandmother was Tsar Nicholas I’s granddaughter. In 1993, a blood sample from Philip allowed scientists to compare the DNA of bones thought to be from the imperial family murdered in Yekaterinburg in 1918 with living relatives. They confirmed their fate at the hands of a Bolshevik firing squad.

9 An aunt, Princess George of Greece, documented a list of her willing extramarital sexual partners in unpublished memoirs, The Men I Have Loved. She believed the closer the clitoris to the vagina, the more chance a woman has of achieving an orgasm – and had her own clitoris surgically shifted in that direction. It didn’t work.

10 Philip’s mother converted to the Greek Orthodox Church but suffered delusions, thinking she was in a sexual relationship with Jesus and that she had a signed photo from him.

11 The first time Elizabeth, then eight, and Philip, 13, saw each other was at the wedding of her uncle, the Duke of Kent, to Philip’s cousin Princess Marina of Greece, on November 29, 1934.

12 In a production of Macbeth at his school, Gordonstoun, Philip played Donalbain, son of the about-to-be-murdered King Duncan.

13 His sister Cecile, her husband and their two sons were killed in an air crash in 1937. She was eight months pregnant and rescuers found remains of a stillborn child in the wreckage. For years afterwards, Philip carried a small piece of the damaged aircraft.

14 At Cecile’s funeral in Germany, Philip’s three brothers-in-law, all German aristocrats, walked alongside him – one was in his full SS uniform while another was dressed as a Nazi stormtrooper.

Elizabeth and Philip talking in the Royal Box at Olympia in London in 1952, the year before she was crowned

15 Hitler and his Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, sent messages of sympathy while Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering marched in the funeral procession.

16 Philip signs himself with the Greek ‘P’.

17 He joined the battleship HMS Valiant in January 1941, helping convoy troops to bolster the British Expeditionary Force in Greece.

18 He manned the searchlights, identifying enemy targets. He later recalled one dramatic battle, saying: ‘All hell broke loose.’

19 His war service was rewarded with the 1939-45 Star; Atlantic Star; Africa Star; Burma Star; Italy Star with Mention in Dispatches; Cross of Valour; Croix de Guerre.

20 In her account of his life, his cousin Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia wrote: ‘Blondes, brunettes, and redhead charmers, Philip gallantly and I think quite impartially squired them all.’

21 As a 22-year-old naval hero, he almost missed a watershed moment – being confined to bed with flu – but rallied to cheer as Elizabeth, 17, performed in a family pantomime of Aladdin at Windsor Castle on December 18, 1943. She played the role of Aladdin, dressed in a revealing costume.

22 Their first memorable meeting had been at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in 1939 when the visiting 13-year-old princess couldn’t take her eyes off the blond, athletic cadet.

23 A year later, the captain of his ship, HMS Ramillies, noted that Philip told him: ‘My Uncle Dickie [Mountbatten] has ideas for me; he thinks I could marry Princess Elizabeth.’

24 That Christmas, Philip sent Elizabeth a Christmas card from Athens.

25 Their engagement was announced on July 9, 1947. He’d asked her ten months earlier at Balmoral. According to his cousin, Elizabeth said it happened ‘beside some well-loved loch, the white clouds sailing overhead and a curlew crying out of sight’.

26 ‘They were bloody to him,’ recalled Earl Mountbatten’s son-in-law John Brabourne. ‘They didn’t like him, they didn’t trust him and it showed.’ The ‘him’ was Philip. The ‘them’ were senior courtiers and the Royals’ aristocratic friends.

27 Three critical lords – Salisbury, Eldon and Stanley – ‘professed to see in him a Teutonic strain’, and one called him ‘Charlie Kraut’.

28 The King’s assistant private secretary, Sir Edward Ford, said some wondered if ‘this rough diamond would treat the Princess with the sensitivity she deserves?’ In truth, the fact that Philip didn’t treat her with ‘the sensitivity she deserves’ was a trait that attracted her to him.

29 The King’s private secretary, Tommy Lascelles, said both the King and Queen ‘felt he was rough, ill-tempered, uneducated and would probably not be faithful’.

30 Elizabeth’s mother wrote letters to friends waxing lyrical about her daughter’s intended, but to Lascelles she said: ‘One can only pray that she has made the right decision. I think she has – but he is untried as yet.’

31 Vehemently anti-German, having lost a brother during the First World War, the Queen Mother was said, years later, in private, to have dubbed her son-in-law ‘the Hun’ and believed he ran the Royal estates ‘like a Junker’ – members of the landed nobility in Prussia.

32 Elizabeth’s cousin Margaret Elphinstone noted that many of Philip’s critics in Royal circles thought he was ‘a foreign interloper out for the goodies’.

33 However, George VI grew to admire his future son- in-law. ‘I like Philip,’ he wrote to his mother Queen Mary in 1944. ‘He is intelligent, has a good sense of humour and thinks about things in the right way.’

34 Philip designed the couple’s platinum engagement ring, featuring 11 diamonds from his mother’s tiara which had to be collected from a bank in Paris where they had been stored after her mental collapse.

35 He gave up smoking at his wife’s request and never relapsed.

36 Philip’s official stag night was at London’s Dorchester Hotel, made up of officers from HMS Whelp. A relatively sober bridegroom left at 12.15am, saying: ‘Sorry I must go. I have an early morning date!’

37 Churchill called the wedding, on November 20, 1947, ‘a flash of colour on the hard road we have to travel’. Mindful of the post-war austerity, George VI agreed there would be no souvenirs or stands and decorations along the procession route.

38 However, the Tory politician ‘Chips’ Channon wrote in his diary: ‘Someone in the Government apparently advised simplicity, misjudging the English love of pageantry and show. Now it is too late and an opportunity missed.’

39 Philip wore his naval uniform with the stars of the Order of the Garter and the Greek Order of the Redeemer.

Each state banquet place setting has three glasses – for red and white wines and champagne. Philip also has a tumbler for his Double Diamond beer (pictured)

40 Breakfast was coffee and toast – topped up with a gin and tonic to steady his nerves.

41 Absent were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, 11 years after his abdication, and Philip’s three sisters – cold-shouldered by the Palace because of their German connections.

42 ‘They minded terribly,’ recalled their cousin Lady Pamela Hicks. ‘It’s not as if they were stormtroopers!’

43 The 'austerity' wedding breakfast consisted of fish, partridges shot on Royal estates and ice cream.

44 The cake was four-tiered, 9ft tall and weighed 500 lb.

45 Among 2,583 presents were 16 pairs of silk stockings and more than 100 nylons, a cylinder vacuum cleaner from Hoover Ltd, an automatic potato-peeler and a Siamese kitten.

46 For their honeymoon night at Broadlands (Mountbatten’s Hampshire mansion), the housekeeper, Mrs Monks, ‘smoothed the pale pink crepe-de-chine sheets and two pillow cases appliqued with a white satin leaf motif’ at least 20 times.

47 In 1946, a 25-year-old Philip met his late father’s mistress, the French actress Comtesse Andree de la Bigne, at a cafe in Monte Carlo. Although she was not mentioned in his will, Philip’s mother kindly gave her his car and any possessions she wanted, which Philip arranged over cocktails.

48 Prince Charles was asked in a 1969 BBC interview whether his disciplinarian father had told him ‘to sit down and shut up’. Charles replied: ‘The whole time, yes,’ before adding: ‘I think he has had quite a strong influence on me, particularly in my younger days.’

49 When asked by Gyles Brandreth about his similarities with his eldest son, Philip interjected: ‘Yes, but with one great difference. He’s a romantic and I’m a pragmatist. That means we do see things differently…’

50 After comments that both stood with their hands behind their backs, as if it were some genetic trait, Charles joked: ‘We both have the same tailor… He makes the sleeves so tight, we can’t get our hands out in front.’

51 The Duke has been a lifelong jazz fan, and is particularly fond of Duke Ellington.

52 The Thursday Club was an all-male weekly lunch group founded by Philip and others at Wheeler’s restaurant in London’s Soho. Famous guests included actor David Niven, and Kim Philby before he was outed as a Soviet spy. One member, Philip’s cousin David Milford Haven, sold his story of the Royal Wedding to a newspaper, and clubbers named him ‘C*** of the Week’.

53 The club held a black-tie stag do five days before the official one. They dined on foie gras, turtle soup, mixed grill and crepes suzette.

54 The Queen seems to have indulged Philip’s need for a lads-only break, apparently referring to the Thursday crew as ‘Philip’s funny friends!’

55 Sunninghill Park, adjoining Ascot racecourse, was due to be the Royal couple’s first home, but it was destroyed by fire while being renovated in 1947. So they switched to Windlesham Moor in Surrey. The dog-loving pair donated the Siamese cat, given as a wedding present, to the cook.

56 Asked in 1971 by his biographer Basil Boothroyd if he saw his own heredity coming out in his children, Philip joked: ‘Yes, all the worst parts.’ He gave three examples of why Charles was similar to the Queen. Daughter Anne, he felt, had much of his own ‘abrupt directness and practicality’.

57 George VI’s death, in the words of one biographer, marked Philip’s ‘near-extinction as an individual under the grinding constitutional millstone’.

58 Whenever he met the Queen Mother during the 50 years of her widowhood, Philip always kissed her on both cheeks, kissed her hand and then bowed.

59 Philip devised his own colour scheme for Buckingham Palace – an official livery in dark green. ‘Edinburgh green’ was also his colour of choice for his cars. In 1954 he bought an Aston Martin Lagonda 3l drophead coupé with bodywork in Edinburgh green and dove-grey leather upholstery.

60 Biographer Graham Turner was told by a courtier that ‘all the girls in his office have to be 36-24-36’. Another household member recalled: ‘If an attractive girl comes into a room or there’s a particularly pretty girl wearing something striking in a line-up, he’ll say “Mm!” very appreciatively – though not in a way that makes you feel embarrassment for the Queen.’

61 ‘As far as I’m concerned,’ he told Jeremy Paxman in 2006, almost wailing, ‘every time I talk to a woman, they say I’ve been to bed with her – as if they had no say in the matter… I’m bloody flattered at my age that some girl is interested in me. It’s absolutely cuckoo!’

62 Throughout her first five years on the throne, the Queen tried to find a suitable title for Philip. In May 1954 she wrote to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, wishing that her husband should have the title Prince of the Commonwealth. Churchill thought reviving Albert’s title of Prince Consort would be more impressive and sounded out all Commonwealth prime ministers. Every one but Canada’s PM supported the idea. However, Philip aborted it, telling the Queen he didn’t want to change his title.

63 Each state banquet place setting has three glasses – for red and white wines and champagne. Philip also has a tumbler for his Double Diamond beer.

64 He also enjoys his own ‘Prince Philip Martini’. The recipe is: lace glass with vermouth by stirring a slice of lemon and a small amount of vermouth in ice, then discarding the liquid. Add a triple measure of gin to some ice. Leave for ten minutes to chill. Pour the liquid, not ice, into the glass.

65 During a small-business discussion about the difficulty of getting rich in Britain, Philip commented: ‘What about Tom Jones? He’s made a million and he’s a bloody awful singer.’

66 In 1969, at the end of a Royal Variety Performance, he told Tom Jones his songs were ‘hideous’, followed up with: ‘What do you gargle with? Pebbles?’

67 The London Palladium was the venue, in 1947, for his first, and Elizabeth’s third, Royal Variety Performance. Top of the bill were Laurel and Hardy making a rare UK appearance.

68 Since its inception, nearly seven million young people in the UK have taken part in the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. But Philip didn’t want it named after him. ‘That was strictly against my better judgment. I tried to avoid it but I was eventually overridden.’

69 He’s used Hawes & Curtis as his tailor, bought shirts from Harrods, shoes from Lobb of St James’s Street and hats from Lock & Co. His socks were a self-supporting design called ‘Tenover’ patented by a page to George VI.

70 Later, he added Johns & Pegg, makers of suits, blazers and sports coats, to his list, as well as another Savile Row tailor, John Kent.

71 North of the border, he used Kinloch Anderson for kilts and anything else tartan.

72 While many aristocrats wear handkerchiefs draped from their top pocket, his is ramrod-straight across.

73 He limits his perusal of newspapers to an ‘occasional glance’ at broadsheets, but has said: ‘The Queen reads every bloody paper she can lay her hands on.’

74 Having claimed his views on poetry are ‘conservative’, he once argued against inviting poet T. S. Eliot to speak at a conference because he was ‘deep, but narrow’.

75 Invited by the Oxford Union to take part in a debate on the monarchy, he jokily replied that ‘members of the Royal Family are expected to refrain from practising free speech on matters loosely termed political’.

76 The actor Matt Smith, who played him in The Crown, told how a friend was at a dinner party attended by Philip, who was asked if he’d watched the Netflix series. The typical ducal retort was: ‘Don’t be ridiculous!’

77 The Royals had a right of veto over the 1969 TV documentary Royal Family. It was passed in its entirety, though Philip was concerned about a scene where a string on Charles’s cello snapped and stung his younger brother Edward in the face, making him cry.

78 His first documented car crash occurred in March 1942. On shore leave, aged 20, he was heading home after a night out in London with his cousin David Milford Haven when their Vauxhall hit a traffic island at 4.30am and was written off.

79 Visiting Magdalen College, Oxford, the Queen and Duke were given a lunch of venison. Afterwards, shown the college’s famous deer park, Philip quipped: ‘How many of those buggers did you have to kill for lunch?’ On being told the meat was from Kent, he joked: ‘Well, don’t tell Charles. Because he likes to buy local.’

80 In 1991 he was given control of a simulated space capsule at Nasa’s HQ in Houston. His verdict: ‘It was like a bloody great mechanical copulator.’

81 As president of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee from 1952 to 1999, he helped with the heptagonal 50p coin – and apparently had concerns about the sexlessness of Britannia, wanting a fuller-figured body ‘in the right proportions that fills the robes’.

82 Surprisingly for a stubborn man, he’s willing to apologise if in the wrong. Having let rip at the Keeper of the Privy Purse in 1970, calling him ‘a silly little Whitehall twit’, he then wrote him a two-page letter saying he didn’t know what had got into him.

83 In the aftermath of Mountbatten’s murder in 1979, he wrote a ‘long and lyrical’ letter to his cousin Patricia Brabourne, who was injured and had lost a 14-year-old twin son in the IRA atrocity and was unable to attend the funeral. Philip wrote her ‘a graphic description of the occasion and how everyone present had felt – exactly what a grieving mother needed to hear’.

84 Charles’s authorised biography, by Jonathan Dimbleby, suggested Philip more or less commandeered him into proposing to Diana Spencer. ‘An intervention from the Duke of Edinburgh had a powerful if not decisive impact on the Prince of Wales,’ he wrote. Charles ‘interpreted his father’s attitude as an ultimatum’. This was disputed by one of Philip’s relatives, who spoke of ‘a loving father giving very sensible advice’.

85 Philip wrote a series of letters to Diana over the summer months of 1992. It was suggested he used the words ‘harlot’ and ‘trollop’. In truth, Diana showed them to her friend Rosa Monckton, who said: ‘His letters were understanding, supportive and thoughtful. He certainly did not use the words harlot and trollop.’

86 Diana called the Duke ‘Dearest Pa’, signing her letters to him with ‘Fondest love’. Philip had said he was eager to ‘do my utmost to help you and Charles to the best of my ability’, adding: ‘I have no talents as a marriage counsellor!!!’ She responded: ‘You are very modest about your marriage guidance skills and I disagree with you! This last letter of yours showed great understanding and tact.’

87 As for the Duchess of York, the infamous toe-sucking photo, showing her topless with her ‘financial adviser’, led Philip to a two-decade avoidance tactic. She said: ‘As soon as I came in through one door he’d be falling over the corgis to get out of the other.’

88 His 11,000-plus books include kitchen classics by Elizabeth David, the Roux brothers and Antonio Carluccio's book on mushrooms.

89 He’s godfather to more than 20 people. Among them are Princess Margareta of Romania, who, in her 20s, had a five-year relationship with the future Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

90 Another godson, Philip Howard-Johnston, set up a used-car firm in Edinburgh.

91 His last godchild is his first cousin three times removed, three-year-old Inigo Hooper.

92 Among his support for an eclectic group of organisations and patronages, he’s a life member of Accrington Camera Club and an honorary member of the Concrete Society (qualifying him for a free copy of Concrete magazine).

93 His interest in the paranormal – in particular UFOs – dates from the beginning of the Queen’s reign. He was a regular subscriber to Flying Saucer Review.

94 One influence for his interest in UFOs was his equerry, Sir Peter Horsley, whom he asked to follow up any credible reports of sightings.

95 He has sat for a grand total of 220 portraits.

96 He gave 5,496 speeches between the Queen’s accession in 1952 and his retirement in 2017.

97 He gave up flying in 1997 aged 76, having completed 5,986 hours of flying time.

98 The Duke was not impressed with claims that those who slaughter meat have a greater moral authority than those who take part in blood sports, saying: ‘I don’t think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing.’

99 He carried out 22,219 solo engagements between 1952 and his retirement in 2017.

100 Philip revealed in 2016 that he hadn’t had flu for the past 40 years.

Tributes flooded in yesterday following the sad news of Sound of Music star Christopher Plummer's death at the age of 91.

The actor, who played the Von Trapp family patriarch in the 1965 musical flick, passed away peacefully at his home in Connecticut, with co-star Dame Julie Andrews calling him a 'consummate actor' and a 'cherished friend'.

Plummer appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Russian author Leo Tolstoy in 2009's The Last Station. He went on to become the oldest actor to win an Academy Award in 2010 for his role in Beginners, playing a pensioner who comes out as gay following the death of his wife.

But for many fans his career was defined by his performance as stern widower Captain von Trapp in The Sound Of Music - a role he once dubbed 'a cardboard figure, humourless and one-dimensional'.

Co-star Andrews, who played Maria Augusta von Trapp, the governess who won the captain's heart in the film, was already a household name after making her feature film debut a year earlier in Mary Poppins in 1964.

So what happened to the rest of the Sound of Music cast - including the seven von Trapp children? Here FEMAIL reveals their varied fates and fortunes.

The von Trapp children

The von Trapp children formed their own little family over the months of making the musical and became known as The SoM 7.

Their parents befriended one another as the young performers travelled to Austria for filming, and the actors themselves have remained close for decades.

'We're beyond friends. We're second family,' said Kym Karath, who played the youngest von Trapp, Gretl. 'As adults, we were deeply bonded, so our lives have really interwoven with each other.'

She quit Hollywood after marrying a dentist, Jay Brent (whom she divorced in 1991), to focus on raising her two daughters Jennifer and Emily, before becoming a successful interior designer.

She died from complications related to dementia in September 2016, aged 73.

Brigitta, played by Angela Cartwright

British-born Angela was 13 when she played the role of 10-year-old Brigitta, but she already had a solid career as a child actress behind her.

Gretl, played by Kym Karath

Five-year-old Karath stole hearts when she played the youngest von Trapp child Gretl.

Roles in Lost In Space and The Brady Bunch followed, but after going to college at USC, she focused on parenting rather than performing when her son Eric was born with disabilities.

Along with other parents, Karath helped establish the Aurelia Foundation, which provides services for special-needs individuals once they finish high school.

She resumed her entertainment career as an actress and writer in 2005. Karath, now 62, has said she still is not fond of water after nearly drowning in the boat scene in Sound of Music, because she couldn't swim.

The 30-year-old spoke to Task & Purpose about his experience during the event and elaborated on why he was selected to escort the 34-year-old singer.

Campbell remarked that, before the event began, many of the organizers were worried about the length of her flowing red Schiaparelli dress.

'There was a concern — obviously she was wearing this very beautiful, very large dress, and there was a concern that she might need some help getting down the stairs,' he explained.

The rest of her outfit was comprised of a fitted navy blue cashmere jacket and a golden dove-shaped brooch.

The combat veteran then recalled that he was chosen to escort the hitmaker due to his large frame.

Campbell noted that the organizers 'basically looked around and I was one of the taller, larger individuals, and they just asked if I would be willing to assist.'

Before the singer took the stage to sing the United States national anthem, the Marine noticed that she was experiencing a bout of stage fright.

The captain then reassured her that she would be fine and gave her words of encouragement.

He elaborated, 'It just seemed like a very natural human thing to do to look over and go, ""Hey you’re going to do great. You always do well, you know, you’re a performer, you’re going to do great.""'

'It just seemed like she needed to hear a relaxed voice,' the captain added.

Campbell also expressed that he was happy to provide a positive image for his fellow Marines.

He noted, 'Millions of people have now seen a United States Marine with Lady Gaga, so I’m just glad I did the Marine Corps proud on this one.'

In a separate interview with The Marine Corps Times, Campbell also related that the singer made a humorous remark about her dress just before they walked on stage together.

He told the publication, 'She looked at me and she’s like ""a fair warning ... we have an equal chance of tripping on this.""'

The presidential inauguration was watched by nearly 40 million people, and over 21 million viewed the subsequent Celebrating America television special.

During the teen years of Louisiana-raised Britney's superstardom, she was heavily sexualized after publicly declaring that she was a virgin.

As she grew into adulthood she was needled in interviews about her breasts and questioned on whether she had remained a virgin as her romance with Timberlake saw her hailed as one half of a pop world power couple.

However, once the pair eventually split in 2002, Justin all but accused his ex of cheating on him when he released his hit track Cry Me A River, which included a video of a Britney lookalike reaping the consequences of infidelity.

And while Britney had continued to publicly maintained that she was still a virgin, Justin suggested otherwise in post breakup interviews.

Accusation: A large number of viewers have accused Justin, 40, of having a hand in tarnishing Britney's image following their 2002 split. Pictured together in 2001

Points of view: Viewers piled in with their cutting points of view after the documentary aired in the US on Friday night

In a flash, Britney was widely seen as the one responsible for the split and even her interviewer Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her: 'What did you do?'

In 2003, Britney sat for an interview with Diane – who played a clip of Maryland's First Lady Kendall Erlich saying figuratively that 'if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears I think I would', a remark for which she later apologised.

Veteran journalist Diane appeared to gently justify the harsh and shocking statement – which was made in reaction to the star wearing 'revealing' clothes, which was cited as a bad influence on children – as she pressed Britney for a response.

When Britney got over her shock at the remark she managed to counter: ‘I’m not here to, you know, babysit her kids.'

MailOnline has contacted Justin and Diane's representatives for comment.

Cutting: Viewers branded Diane Sawyer, 75, a 'sl**-shamer' for her interview with the star, in which she questioned her about the breakup and her 'revealing' clothes'. Pictured in 2019

Line of questioning: The viewers took umbrage to the veteran journalist's line of questioning

After the airing of Framing Britney Spears, which aired in the US on Friday night, viewers took to Twitter in droves to strike out at Justin and Diane.

Wrote one: 'Justin Timberlake laughed and got “revenge” in cry me a river ...Britney had to go on TV with Diane Sawyer and break down crying in an interview after they broke up...That s**t would NOT fly in today's culture. #FreeBritney'

Tweeted another viewer: 'Nasty a*s old people asking a teenage Britney all the time if she was a virgin. How big her boobs gotten. And Justin Timberlake publicly announcing that he took her V card!!! The s**t she went through.'

'I think it’s time for @DianeSawyer to issue a public apology to Britney Spears,' said a third. 'She treated her disgustingly and never once said sorry. Speak up sis. You were VERY wrong for the way you interviewed her.'

Grilling: Following the 2002, split, Britney was widely portrayed as the villainess and even Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her, 'What did you do?'

Emotional: The Louisiana-raised star was also seen looking emotional as she learned that a politician's wife had stated she would 'shoot' the star if she could, because of her clothing

Penned another fan of the star: 'Diane Sawyer literally tried to defend a woman who said “If it wasn’t illegal to shoot Britney I would” to Britney because Britney was wearing “revealing” clothes and mothers are worried about their children because of it? LIKE WTF???'

However, some fans jumped to former NSYNC frontman Justin's defence, explaining that he was also young at the time of his split from Britney.

Explaining their stance, one wrote: 'All this Justin and Britney shit was way too much for two young ppl. They were way too young for ppl to have so much expectations and so much judgement. #FreeBritney (sic)'

'Am I the only Britney fan who also loves Justin Timberlake?' queried another. I get he should have apologized for things he said but sometimes if the two parties involved have no ill will, doesn’t mean we have to put ourselves between their issue. She has moved on.'

Iconic relationship: Britney found herself in crisis when Justin blamed her for the breakup in his single Cry Me A River

Defence: However, some fans jumped to former NSYNC frontman Justin's defence, explaining that he was also young at the time of his split from Britney

Wrote a third: 'I love @jtimberlake but in all honesty. He wouldn’t have had anything to write about for his 1st album if it wasn’t for the breakup with @britneyspears & @Pharrell giving him most of @michaeljackson demo songs. #JustSayThankYou'

At the time of Britney and Justin's split, it was rumoured that she had cheated on the pop heartthrob with dancer Wade Robson, now 38.

However, it has also been claimed that Justin cheated on Britney multiple times in the year leading up to them calling time on their ill-fated romance.

In the years following the couple's breakup, Britney would endure a very public unravelling, that culminated in her shaving off her hair in early 2007.

Shortly afterwards, she was placed under a conservatorship, handled by her father Jamie, which she remains under to this day – despite trying to fight it.",Britney Spears fans slam ex Justin Timberlake as new documentary revisits bitter split

After arriving in March for a holiday and to escape the Covid pandemic in the U.S, where 451,000 have died, it appears the High School Musical star, 33, has decided to make his move permanent.

He's following in the footsteps of Chris Hemsworth, who relocated from Los Angeles to Australia in 2014 - but there's a big difference between the two. While the Thor star is a born and raised Aussie, Zac grew up in California, which may have a reputation for being laid-back, but is definitely not as friendly and safe as Australia.

And from shooting Stan Original movie Gold to falling in love with a Byron Bay waitress and buying land in New South Wales, the stars seems to be aligning for Zac calling Australia home.

Meeting girlfriend Vanessa Valladares

He's a local now! Zac Efron has been living Down Under for a year, and it looks like he's here to stay. Pictured with his girlfriend Vanessa Valladares, a waitress from Byron Bay

Zac met Vanessa Valladares, 25, in July when she was working as a waitress at Byron Bay's General Store & Café, after they were introduced by her boss.

The part-time model has fitted seamlessly into the star's entourage of high-profile friends, and has been regularly visiting her boyfriend while he films Stan's Gold in South Australia.

While the couple are living together in Byron Bay, but have also enjoyed regular trips to Sydney and the Thredbo ski resort.

Their relationship is believed to be serious, with a source telling New Idea magazine: 'I really think Zac's at the point where he'd marry Vanessa tomorrow if she said yes.'

New love: Zac met Vanessa Valladares, 25, in July when she was working as a waitress at Byron Bay's General Store & Café, after they were introduced by her boss

In October, Zac's friend Kyle Sandilands, who is an influential and popular radio host, said that you 'couldn't get a lovelier, sweeter girl' than Vanessa.

'They're a beautiful couple. They do everything together. They're just sweet,' he said.

If Zac were to return to the U.S. with the coronavirus pandemic still raging and causing chaos, Vanessa wouldn't be able to go with him. This makes it even more likely he's set to stay Down Under, at least for the next year.

Buying property

Home away from home: Zac has reportedly purchased land in Tweed Valley, a town on the Tweed River in north-eastern NSW, for $2million

Zac has reportedly purchased land in Tweed Valley, a town on the Tweed River in north-eastern NSW, for $2million.

He's said to be planning to build a home on the site and settle down with Vanessa.

The 130-hectare block of land is a slice of paradise with incredible views of mountains, cliffs, valleys, streams and rainforest.

There's three clear-water creeks, rock waterfalls, water holes and two spring-fed dams.

Zac was also rumoured to have been considering buying a $22million mansion near Wategos Beach in Byron Bay - but in the end Rip Curl co-founder Brian Singer snapped the property up.

The 17 Again star is instead understood to be renting another property in the coastal NSW town, where he lives with Vanessa when he's not filming projects.

Selling up in LA

Sweeping views: In yet another sign the Hollywood heart-throb is here to stay, he recently put his Los Angeles property on the market for $7.8million

In yet another sign the heart-throb is here to stay, he recently put his house in Los Angeles on the market for $7.8million.

The two-storey home has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms, in addition to a separate one-bedroom guesthouse under the carport.

The guesthouse is currently decked out as a gym, complete with a sauna box.

Zac had purchased the mansion seven years ago for $5.8million.

If he had plans to move back to the U.S., the last thing he'd do is sell a home in the booming Los Angeles property market, where prices rose almost 10 per cent last year, and high-end homes for sale are scarce.

Becoming a local

He's a local! Earlier this week, Zac revealed he was camping in the South Australian outback in a $140,000 Lotus caravan. He looked like a true blue Aussie in an Akubra hat while posing in front of his motorhome

Luxury: Zac's 'home sweet home' features a comfortable double bed, a leather sofa and seating area, pop-up TVs, a cooker and hot water

Room for two: Zac did not reveal whether his girlfriend Vanessa was accompanying him on location, but she has been spotted regularly visiting him over the past few months

Earlier this week, Zac revealed he was camping in the South Australian outback in a $140,000 Lotus caravan.

He also looked like a true blue Aussie in an Akubra hat while posing in front of the luxury motorhome in a photo shared to Instagram.

Tellingly, he captioned the image: 'Home sweet home.'

Zac's caravan, which he's renting for free as part of a sponsorship deal, features a double bed, a leather sofa and seating area, pop-up TVs, a cooker and hot water.

The actor previously said it was 'easy' keeping a low profile during his visits to Australia because of the sparsely populated beaches down the coast.

'What I love about Australia, which is what we don't have in California, is there are so many wide-open beaches where no one is at,' he said.

Cancelling his flight to America

Daily Mail Australia revealed in August he'd cancelled his scheduled flight back to LA.

Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months prior, in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.

But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.

Zac is understood to have received a last-minute refund for his ticket.

'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source said at the time. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'

Calling Australia 'home'

Since arriving Down Under, Zac has often referred to Australia as his 'home' - and he did so last week while filming in the South Australian outback.

Just last month, People reported he had 'no plans to live permanently in LA again.'

'He loves Australia and considers it his home,' a source said.

After visiting the country several times over the years, Zac has made it known that he adores the Aussie lifestyle and everything it entails.

'I've fallen in love with Australia,' Zac said in a 2017 interview. 'I love the people, the culture and the beach.'

When Zac came to SA to shoot Gold, a Kent Town barber who cut his hair said the actor plans to return to the location 'in the middle of next year' to go sightseeing.

'He absolutely loves South Australia,' Robby Lippett told Adelaide Now.

Hollywood actor Wood, 33, shared more details of the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of the rock star on her Instagram story Friday.

She claimed Manson, real name Brian Hugh Warner, would use the 'N-word', called her 'a 'Jew' in a 'derogatory manner' and told her it was 'better' that her mother had converted to Judaism and did not have Jewish descent because it meant she wasn't 'blood Jewish'.

Wood posted photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols, just days after another alleged victim claimed the 52-year-old rocker once asked her to buy him Nazi paraphernalia.

In Friday's Instagram story, Wood also denied she and Manson were just having 'kinky sex' when he 'tortured' her saying they 'never had a 'BDSM' relationship' and that she 'thought [she] was going to die.'

Wood was among the first to publicly accuse Manson of abuse in an Instagram post Monday where she claimed he starting 'grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years'.

Since then, at least 11 women have come forward accusing the rocker of physical and sexual abuse dating back several years.

Manson has denied all the allegations as 'distortions of reality'.

On Friday, his long-time manager Tony Ciulla dropped him as a client after 25 years, joining his record label and talent agency who parted ways with the rocker off the back of the claims this week.

This comes two days after police were called out to Manson's Hollywood Hills home Wednesday night to carry out a 'welfare check' after a concerned friend was unable to get in touch with him as new allegations continued to surface against him.

Evan Rachel Wood (pictured) has claimed Marilyn Manson hurled anti-Semitic abuse at her, has two Nazi tattoos and drew swastikas on her bedside table 'when he was mad' during their relationship. Wood and Manson pictured together in 2007 around the time they started dating

Westworld star Wood, who started dating Manson in 2007 before they split in 2010, said Friday Manson made derogatory comments about her Jewish heritage on top of the 'grooming' and 'horrific abuse' she previously said she endured.

'I was called a 'jew' in a derogatory manner,' she wrote in an Instagram Story.

'He would draw swastikas over my bedside table when he was mad at me.'

Wood explained that her mom is Jewish and she was raised in the religion.

'Because she converted and wasn't of Jewish descent he would say things like, 'that's better' because I wasn't 'blood Jewish,'' she said.

The actor also shared photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols.

Wood circled the tattoos on his arms and shared a screen grab from an article of a similar-looking skull-and-crossbones adopted by the Nazis.

'Totenkopf is German for 'death's head' and typically refers to a skull-and-crossbones image,' it reads.

'During the Nazi era, Hitler's Schutzstaffel (SS) adopted one particular Totenkopf image as a symbol.

'Among other uses, it became the symbol of the SS-Totenkopfverbande (one of the original three branches of the SS, along with the Algemeine SS and the Waffen SS), whose purpose was to guard the concentration camps.'

Wood shared another image of a tattoo on Manson's chest and a screengrab from community site Manson Wiki that claims the image is an M-swastika.

'He did not have these tattoos when we started dating,' Wood wrote.

One of Manson's other accusers, Ashley Lindsay Morgan, claimed this week he had once asked her to buy Nazi memorabilia for him in Asia and bring it to the US.

Hollywood actor Wood, 33, shared more details of the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of the rock star on her Instagram Story Friday

She claimed Manson, real name Brian Hugh Warner, called her 'a 'Jew' in a derogatory manner'

As well as the anti-Semitism and Nazi symbolism, Wood also claimed Friday Manson would often say the N-word and that, if anyone tried to confront him about it, they would be 'abused more.'

'I heard the 'n' word over and over,' she wrote.

'Everyone around him was expected to laugh and join in. If you did not or (god forbid) called him out, you were singled out and abused more.'

Wood said she had 'never been so scared in my life.'

The actor, who met the rock star when she was just 18, hit out at suggestions the abuse was just 'kinky sex'.

'Brian and I never had a 'BDSM' relationship,' she said in a now-deleted Instagram story.

'We didn't even have 'kinky' sex. We weren't having sexual intercourse when I was being tortured, before or after.'

She added: 'I thought I was going to die the entire time.'

Wood also shared footage from her testimony before the US Congress and California Senate in 2018 where she spoke about her experience with domestic violence and rape as part of a campaign to advocate for Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Acts in all 50 states.

The 33-year-old also shared photos of two tattoos on Manson's arms and another on his chest which she said are Nazi symbols. Wood circled the tattoos on his arms and shared a screen grab from an article of a similar-looking skull-and-crossbones adopted by the Nazis

Wood also shared an image of a tattoo on Manson's chest and a screengrab from community site Manson Wiki that claims the image is an M-swastika

Wood added in another Instagram story that Manson 'did not have these tattoos when we started dating'

She also shared posts from Manson's other alleged victims, news stories documenting the claims, and an article responding to the questions being leveled at the women who have come forward.

Wood first named her alleged abuser on social media Monday.

'The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,' she wrote in a social media post.

'I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

'I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

'I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.'

She also posted screenshots of tweets written by Dan Cleary - Manson's former assistant in December 2020.

He said in them that he knew Wood when she was with Manson and that by the end of their relationship, he had 'broken' her.

In a 2009 interview with Spin, Manson made disturbing remarks about wanting to 'smash' Wood's skull in.

He was being asked about his new album and was asked: 'It sounds like the period after you and Evan Rachel Wood broke up was really tough. What was your lowest point?'

He replied: 'My lowest point was Christmas Day 2008, because I didn’t speak to my family. My walls were covered in scrawlings of the lyrics and cocaine bags nailed to the wall.

She also denied they were just having 'kinky sex' when he 'tortured' her saying they 'never had a 'BDSM' relationship' and that she 'thought [she] was going to die'

'And I did have an experience where I was struggling to deal with being alone and being forsaken and being betrayed by putting your trust in one person, and making the mistake of that being the wrong person.

'And that’s a mistake that everyone can relate to. I made the mistake of trying to, desperately, grasp on and save that and own it. And every time I called her that day — I called 158 times — I took a razor blade and I cut myself on my face or on my hands.

'I didn’t want people to ask me every time I did an interview, “Oh, is this record about your relationship with your ex-girlfriend?” But that damage is part of it, and the song “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies” is about my fantasies.

'I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.' The interviewer replied: 'Wow'. He replied: 'Merry Christmas'.

Manson and Wood got engaged after the interview and did not break up for another year after it took place.

When the comments resurfaced in November 2020, Manson's reps downplayed them as him being a 'theatrical rockstar'.

'The comments where Manson had a fantasy of using a sledgehammer on Evan and he cut himself 158 times was obviously a theatrical rockstar interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account,' they said.

'The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally.'

Wood, now 33, was engaged to Manson for eight months in 2010.

In 2018, she testified before Congress as part of a campaign for domestic violence victims about being tied up, raped and beaten by a partner when she was a teenager.

At least 11 women have now come forward to accuse him of abuse dating back years

She did not name her abuser at the time but said she had been told she could not take it to police because the statute of limitations had expired.

'My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gas-lighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body,' she said.

Wood was one of five women who made coordinated statements on Instagram Monday about how Manson allegedly abused them.

They are Wood, an artist known only as Gabriella; photographer Ashley Walters; model Sarah McNeilly; and model Ashley Lindsay Morgan.

They claimed they had been victims of sexual misconduct, manipulation, and physical and emotional abuse at Manson's hands.

The women's allegations vary but all say Manson left them with PTSD after forcing them into blood pacts, plying them with drugs, becoming violent with them and gaslighting them.

Artist Gabriella claimed she dated Marilyn Manson for six months between 2015 and 2016 and that he drove her to attempt suicide after tying her up, depriving her of sleep and plying her with drugs during their relationship which began when she was 22 and he was 46.

She shared photographs of herself with Manson and texts she says he sent her to add validity to her story.

On Monday night, another three women made allegations on social media that Wood re-posted on her account. They did not go into detail about their relationships with Manson but all three said he was an abuser.

Wood first named her alleged abuser on social media Monday (above)

Evan Rachel Wood (shown with Manson in 2007) named him as her abuser on Monday in an Instagram post. The pair dated and became engaged in 2010 but split later that year

Those women are Scarlett Kapella, Brittany Leigh, and Torii Lynn.

On Tuesday, four more women made allegations against the rocker.

Visual filmmaker Love Bailey claimed Manson once held a gun to her forehead.

In an Instagram video she claimed that Manson told her he didn't 'like f*****s' as he held the weapon to her head while she was working at a shoot in his home in 2011.

Musician Chloe Black spoke out on Instagram to allege Manson deprived her of sleep, made racist and anti-Semitic comments and that she once 'thought he was actually going to kill me.'

Artist and writer Louise Keay Bell claimed Manson 'emotionally and financially abused me and tried to control me' from the age of 19.

Actor Charlyne Yi also alleged Manson harassed her and other women on the set of the TV series House and said when she spoke out about the abuse three years ago she had received death threats.

Former porn star Jenna Jameson told DailyMail.com this week that Manson fantasized about burning her alive and ‘liked to bite’ during sex when they dated back in 1997.

Wood (pictured) was among the first women to speak out Monday accusing Manson of abuse

On Thursday, Indie star Phoebe Bridgers said she 'stand[s] by' Manson's alleged victims as she recalled a time she visited Manson's home as a teenager and the 52-year-old rock star showed her a room he described as his 'rape room'.

She slammed people now 'pretending to be shocked' about the abuse allegations as 'f**ing pathetic'.

Manson has denied all the claims since they started surfacing.

He said in a statement Monday: 'Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

'My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.'

Comments were turned off the post, but it was liked by Manson's wife, Lindsay Usich. She has not released her own statement.

Manson's ex-wife Von Teese addressed the allegations leveled at Manson in a statement on Instagram Wednesday.

In it, the 48-year-old burlesque star said she had been 'processing the news' about her ex, who she dated for six years before they tied the knot in 2005.

Love Bailey spoke out Tuesday evening about a time Manson allegedly put a gun to her head

On Monday night, Scarlette Kapella (pictured left) and Torii Lynn (pictured right) both also said they too had been victims of abuse by Manson

CALIFORNIA SENATOR DEMANDED FBI PROBE INTO MARILYN MANSON A WEEK BEFORE THE ACCUSERS WENT PUBLIC California State Senator Susan Rubio requested an FBI and Justice Department probe into Marilyn Manson more than a week before his accusers went public with their claims. On January 21, Rubio wrote to the FBI and Attorney General demanding an investigation into Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. She demanded that investigators contact his accusers to find out more about their claims. On Monday morning, Evan Rachel Wood and four other women posted statements alleging years of 'horrific abuse' by Manson in what appeared to be a coordinated move. On Monday night, Wood posted a photo of Rubio's January 21 letter on her Instagram account. Now, Rubio's office is refusing to say how they knew about the abuse allegations early. Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department will confirm if they have opened an investigation. Rubio's letter reads: 'The alleged victims have named Marilyn Manson, also known as Brian Hugh Warner, as the perpetrator. 'I ask that the U.S. Department of Justice meet with the alleged victims immediately and investigate these accusations,' Senator Rubio wrote in the letter. 'As a domestic violence survivor who now advocates for victims in my role of California state legislator, I share a common trauma of emotional, psychological, and physical control at the hands of an abuser.' Rubio added that she was 'especially alarmed' because some of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place in California. Advertisement

Von Teese insisted the experiences detailed by Manson's alleged victims 'do not match' her own experience with the rock star.

'Please know that the details made public do not match my personal experience during our 7 years together as a couple,' she wrote.

'Had they, I would not have married him in December 2005.'

She said she left Manson and filed for divorce 12 months after they wed 'due to infidelity and drug abuse.'

While Von Teese said she had not been abused by Manson during their time together, she wished 'strength' on the women who had come forward.

'Abuse of any kind has no place in any relationship. I urge those of you who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself,' she wrote.

Von Teese said she also appreciated the 'kindness' of people who voiced concern for her 'well-being' following the news this week.

Rose McGowan, one of Manson's former girlfriends, also said in a statement that while he was never abusive to her, she 'stands with' the accusers on Monday.

Manson has since been dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Records, talent agency CAA and he has been edited out of American Gods and Creepshow, two shows he was taking part in.

On Friday, Tony Ciulla, his manager of more than two decades also distanced himself.

Ciulla, who hasn't commented on the abuse allegations against his client, dropped Manson after Woods publicly named him on social media earlier this week, a source told Rolling Stone.

There are now also questions around how the allegations came to the surface.

California State Senator Susan Rubio wrote to the FBI and the Justice Department demanding an investigation into Manson on January 21 - a week before the claims became public.

No investigation has been launched and Manson has never been arrested for any of the women's allegations.

LAPD cops were called to Manson's Hollywood Hills home over concerns for his safety Wednesday night amid the growing number of allegations against him.

Four police cruisers and an LAPD helicopter were dispatched to Manson's home around 6.00pm to perform a 'welfare check' on the 52-year-old after a concerned friend couldn't get in touch with him, reported TMZ.

An LAPD spokesperson told DailyMail.com officers from the North Hollywood division responded to a call for a welfare check at a home on the 3400 block of Troy Drive, Studio City, around 6.00pm Wednesday.

Police later told DailyMail.com they were able to make contact with someone and found there was 'no evidence of any trouble whatsoever' at the property.",Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson hurled anti-Semitic abuse at her and drew swastikas

The Savage hitmaker honored her astrological sign of Aquarius as she will be turning 26 on February 15.

Megan posted the series of images as collages, showing her in a tight lavender bodysuit and vibrant wig.

She donned a feather bolero in a matching purple hue and pouted and posed away in the fun shoot.

While Megan focuses on her birthday celebrations, Tory Lanez reportedly filed new documents last week seeking the ability to publicly discuss allegations she waged against him, according to TMZ.

'Real Aquarius Girl S**t' she captioned the series - a play on her 'Real hot girl s**t' lyrics from her massive 2019 track Hot Girl Summer

In court documents, Lanez said it's 'unfair' that Megan can speak on the July incident in publications and across social media, but he's not allowed to defend himself due to the court order.

Lanez was arrested for a felony count of carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle, and was later charged with one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.

Megan took to Twitter last week to address rumors that the charges were dropped and said: ""AT THIS POINT IM GETTING ANNOYED! STOP BELIEVING EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE MF INTERNET. Imagine how I feel waking every day seeing people LIE and turn my trauma into a joke? That whole team figures out ways to create doubt with my story every week and the media eats it up.'

His team says that there is 'evidence of gunshot residue implicating others,' but he's not allowed to discuss anything due to the protective order.

Megan told GQ in November's cover story that she was 'offered' money to stay quiet about the alleged shooting in July, and went on to detail how she was shot twice in the foot after leaving a pool party in the Hollywood Hills.

His lawyers responded to TMZ about the buy-out claims and said he 'has never offered money to any witness for their silence or for any other reason. Any reports to the contrary are false.'

Megan revealed that she was simply trying to go home when she got in the car with Lanez, a move she was hesitant to even make as an argument was brewing and her phone had died.

Party mode: While Megan focuses on her birthday celebrations, Tory Lanez reportedly filed new documents last week seeking the ability to publicly discuss allegations she waged against him, according to TMZ

When Megan attempted to get out of the vehicle, Lanez allegedly shot at her feet and wounded her twice.

People accused Megan of lying about the incident and she later named Lanez as the person who shot her in the foot, which spiraled into a he-said/she-said war online.

After back and forth she tweeted: 'Black women are so unprotected & we hold so many things in to protect the feelings of others w/o considering our own.

But Ed Sheeran made a rare appearance in public as he helped to promote a giveaway for guitar company Lowden via their YouTube channel on Saturday.

'They're scattered around, because it's just nice to walk into a room and have a beautiful instrument there that you can pick up and play.

'It was important for the 13-year-old in me being able to get the quality of a Lowden guitar but also it not be an unachievable feat. I personally think it's better than anything else in its price bracket.'

Ed has used both guitars which are being given away, he's played them during recording sessions and even used one in his music video for new track Afterglow.

It marked the first new material from Ed since the 2019 album, No.6 Collaborations Project, which featured the likes of Stormzy, Khalid, Cardi B, Chance the Rapper and Eminem, and comes a year after the singer-songwriter announced his hiatus from music.

Ed announced his break from the spotlight last year, and welcomed his first child with wife Cherry Seaborn, daughter Lyra, in August.

In the spirit: The 36-year-old member of the British royal family certainly seemed comfortable in front of the camera as he could be seen with a smile on his face while chatting with his longtime pal

Corden is best known for his recurring Carpool Karaoke segment which has included A-list guests including Adele, Stevie Wonder, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and Elton John.

The source said: 'They taped a COVID appropriate segment of Carpool Karaoke on the double decker. They have been friends for years and had a great time. A lot of joking around and laughter.

'They toured Hollywood and James showed Harry some special landmarks. They also chatted about Harry's life in the US and his focus now.'

The group were seen leaving the CBS Studios lot around noon and were even joined by a police escort according to TMZ.

Corden and Prince Harry have been friends for years as the chat show host and his wife Julia Carey attended the royal wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018.

The Duke and Duchess, 39, sparked a major royal crisis in January 2020 with a bombshell statement saying they intended to stop being senior royals, earn their own money and still support the Queen.

But the dual role was unworkable. The Queen held a summit at Sandringham to deal with the crisis and the outcome was a hard Megxit.

At the end of March 2020, less than two years after they wed, Harry and Meghan quit as working royals completely and stopped using their HRH styles.

They have since settled into a new life in California, secured lucrative multimillion-pound deals with Netflix and Spotify, volunteered during the Covid-19 crisis and been working on their Archewell foundation.

Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, reveals the Duchess' series of awkward faux-pas in tonight's When Fergie Met The Monarchy on Channel 5.

She told how Fergie, then aged around 24, travelled to the Sandringham estate to meet the family of her boyfriend Prince Andrew - a meeting which could make or break their union.

Unsure to whom she should curtsey, Seward told how Fergie knelt before everyone in order to avoid offence.

A documentary airing tonight on Channel 5 looks back at Sarah Ferguson's relationship with the royal family before and after her wedding to Prince Andrew on 23 July 1986 (pictured at Westminster Abbey on the day)

In the documentary, royal commentator and editor of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward reveals a 'nervous' Fergie committed several blunders upon meeting the Queen at the Sandringham Estate (pictured with The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Andrew on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the Queen's 60 birthday in April 1980)

Fergie's parents, Major Ronald Ferguson and Susan Ferguson, had previously been invited for a shoot on the royal estate and it's thought they briefed their daughter on the dos and don't of staying with the Firm.

However, Seward said the young redhead fell victim to nerves while trying to impress her boyfriend's parents - the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh - along with other senior royals.

'Her own mother and father had been to Sandringham for shooting weekends and obviously, they had told her what to do, so she was not completely ignorant of how it was going to work, but she was nervous,' Seward explains.

'When she walked into the sitting room in Sandringham she tripped over one of the Queen's Corgis, and she spilled her drink.

'And in her fluster she thought, ""Who are all these people?"" so she just curtsied to everyone - but in that way, she knew she was not making a faux-pas.'

Sarah Ferguson still lives with Prince Andrew at Royal Lodge in Windsor (pictured recently)

Relationship psychologist Anjula Mutanda tells how meeting the parents and wanting to make a good impression under pressure could lead some people to commit mistakes due to nerves.

'You know that everybody's gaze is on you,' she says.

'So I think she found herself in that situation of feeling, ""I don't know if they're going to like me, I also want them to absolutely adore me"". And all that at once can be a pressure cooker for things to monumentally wrong and I think in Sarah's case it kinda did.'

However, after this awkward introduction, Fergie worked on winning over all the senior members of the Firm, learning to drive carriages with Philip and riding with Her Majesty.

'She had learned to ride at a very young age and the Queen loves horses and the fact Fergie could accompany her on rides was a huge plus,' Daily Mail's Editor at Large Richard Kay observes.

Prince Andrew and Fergie, who had grown up in the same circles but reconnected in 1985, got married on July 23, 1986.

Unfortunately the couple, who share two daughters, Princess Beatrice, 32, and Princess Eugenie, 30, grew apart, with their relationship starting to unravel in the 1990s, leading to their separation in 1992 and subsequent divorce in 1996.

The Duke and Duchess have stayed 'best friends' for their two daughters; they still live together at Royal Lodge in Windsor, where they have both spent lockdown.

However, their estrangement led to a series of indiscretions which caused Fergie to fall out of favour with the royals, especially the Queen.

The documentary also looks back on an incident which became known as 'toegate,' where pictures of a topless Fergie having her toes kissed by Texan millionaire John Bryan were published in the press.

Fergie's relationship with the royal family suffered from her 1992 separation from Andrew and subsequent divorce in 1996.

The photos, which were released when Eugenie and Beatrice were with their father at Balmoral visiting the Queen, are believed to be the reason why Fergie was shunned by the Royal Family.

It also touches on the 'cash-for-access scandal' of 2010, where Fergie allegedly promised a businessman to arrange a meeting with Prince Andrew for the sum of £500,000.

Unbeknownst to the Duchess of York at the time, she was being taped by reporters from the now defunct New of the World tabloid. The Duchess later took legal action to clear her name.

A very pregnant and makeup-free Emma Stone has been spotted flaunting her growing belly while running errands in Los Angeles.

The 32-year-old actress was seen leaving an office building after attending a two-hour meeting earlier this week, exclusive photos obtained by DailyMail.com show.

Stone, who secretly married husband Dave McCary last year, is still yet to confirm she's expecting her first child, but showed off her adorable baby bump during Wednesday's outing.

The La La Land star appeared comfy and casual as she stepped out alone in a denim tunic, black leggings, and black mules, matched with a Louis Vuitton Cannes handbag that retails for $2,820.

Stone, 32, is still yet to publicly confirm she is expecting her first child with husband Dave McCary despite being photographed in recent months with a growing bump

Stone appeared engrossed in her phone while heading to her car following a two-hour meeting at an office building

Emma Stone and Dave McCary secretly tied the knot last year after dating for three years. The pair were seen attending a Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers basketball game at Staples Center on January 18, 2019

Stone had her hair tied up in a bun and wore sunglasses and a white protective face mask that she later removed once she got into her car.

The sighting comes weeks after Stone had been photographed cradling her belly while out on a walk in LA with a female friend.

It is unknown when Stone is due to give birth, but she appears to be pretty far along in her pregnancy.

Reps for the actress declined to comment when approached by DailyMail.com at the time, however, a source told E! News earlier last month that Stone is indeed expecting. 'Emma is pregnant and just loves married life!', the insider said.

Rumors of Stone's pregnancy began to swirl in December after it was reported she had dropped out of an upcoming film featuring Brad Pitt.

She was slated to play the lead in La La Land director Damien Chazelle's Old Hollywood epic Babylon but left the cast after an apparent scheduling conflict.

It is unknown when Stone is due to give birth, but she appears to be pretty far along in her pregnancy

But it appears the 'conflict' may just be Stone taking time to raise her first child.

According to Deadline, Australian actress Margot Robbie, 30, is now being lined up by producers to swiftly replace Stone.

The movie was supposed to begin filming in Los Angeles before the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to plans, so it's likely the change in filming dates created a conflict.

Distributed by Paramount, Babylon is currently slated for a Christmas Day 2021 release.

Stone and husband Dave McCary are notoriously private with their personal life.

In September, DailyMail.com spotted the couple wearing matching gold bands on their ring fingers as they took a walk.

The actress and the SNL alum, 35, announced their engagement in December 2019 in a sweet social media post, as Stone showed off her stunning diamond and pearl ring.

They were reportedly supposed to have their wedding in mid-March, but had to call it off due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But in May, Stone had swapped out her engagement ring for a simple gold band, leading to speculation that she and McCary had secretly tied the knot.

Those pictures prompted the rumors that Stone was pregnant, as she was seen dressed in baggy overalls with an apparent bump.

Last May rumors first flew that Stone had secretly gotten married to McCary when she sported a wedding band during a YouTube appearance with Reese Witherspoon.

She dropped a further hint that she may now be a married woman when Dr Harold Koplewicz, who was also on the chat, asked her about marrying an 'anxious man'.

He said: 'If you marry an anxious man, you're going to have to know me the rest of my life.

While Emma reassured him and said: 'Thankfully I didn't do that.'

Emma met the former segment director on Saturday Night Live back in 2016 when she hosted the late-night sketch show.

The actress was set to walk down this aisle in Los Angles in March but decided to hold off due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to Page Six.",A very pregnant Emma Stone flaunts her belly while running errands in LA

She told MialOnline: 'Brooklyn has chosen an elegant and classic design with an emerald-cut diamond solitaire set on a very fine band of platinum or white gold.

Kylie has been dating GQ boss Paul, 46, since 2018 and in recent months has remained bashful over any speculation they are set to wed.

Paul's stepmother Gloria told MailOnline she was 'thrilled' and 'excited' that the pair are planning to marry as she spoke to MailOnline from the family home in the South Wales village of Llanbradach, near Caerphilly.

The news was accidentally revealed by former pop star turned actress Billie Piper, 38, in an interview with British ELLE magazine, released on Thursday.

Gloria, who has been married to Paul's father Mark for 41 years, said she had not been aware of Billie's engagement slip - and was eager for details of her comments.

Gloria stood in the doorway of her terraced home as rain poured down listening to a detailed account of Billie's revelation of how Paul had saved her life in a London nightclub years previously when she was just 18.

After being told the story, which she appeared not to have known, Gloria declared with a broad smile: 'Well, she's right there, my son is a hero.'

Gloria said she had met Kylie and liked her. 'She's very nice I'm thrilled they're engaged.

'It's very exciting. But, I'm sorry, I cannot tell you any more because I've been told not to. I respect my son and I respect Kylie too much to say any more.'

She said she did not know where or when the wedding will take place.

Paul's brother-in-law, Ivor Jones, said he and wife Nicola - Paul's sister - had met 'absolutely lovely' Kylie.

'She is absolutely lovely,' said builder Mr. Jones, who has a 2020-plate grey F Pace Jaguar on the driveway next to his work van.

Hmm... Despite posing with her ring and the words from Paul's stepmother, after posting the video Kylie took to Twitter to claim she is not engaged

He added: 'Give me a million and we can say something.'

Despite Gloria's confirmation, a representative for Kylie told denied the engagement to MailOnline.

While Kylie was born in Melbourne, Paul's home is in a far less sunny location as his family home in the South Wales former mining village of Llanbradach is a world away from Kylie’s secluded island hideaway in Australia.

The singer’s Western Port Bay home is set in 100 hectares of luscious countryside and flanked by the ocean, while the view from the front door at Paul’s family home is comparatively dismal.

The terraced Edwardian property overlooks a recreation ground. Football goalposts and a children’s playground featuring brightly-coloured plastic dominate the outlook.

Half a mile away, his sister, Nicola, lives in a modest single story, pebble-dashed property. Visitors to the bungalow have to walk through a gate in a two-metre high wooden fence to find the entrance.

Llanbradach saw its coal mine open in 1890. It closed in 1961. The village has three pubs, several convenience stores and a primary school.

After several long-term relationships, Kylie became engaged in 2016 to British actor Joshua Sasse, who was 28 at the time, but the relationship ended a year later and subsequently suffered a breakdown.

Kylie then started dating Paul in 2018 and last year gushed: 'I've met someone who I feel good with. It feels right.'

Agreed! Kylie told how she and Paul got together after a mutual friend suggested they meet but it took her a while before she agreed to it

While Kylie is a pop icon, Paul, a graphic design graduate from Nottingham Trent University, is a media mogul and has been the award-winning creative director at British GQ and GQ style magazine since 2001.

He previously worked at Marie Claire and has his own company Paul Solomons Design LTD.

In October it was then reported by New Idea that the pair were planning to marry in Melbourne this year, depending on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wedding bell speculation rang once in November when she appeared on Lorraine and grew bashful over some questioning.

Kylie said: 'He is so nice. He is probably not watching, I am sure he is at work. 'He is such a good support. We have a laugh. We have both been through enough in our lives and just met at the right time, so it's lovely.'

Her love: In 2015, Kylie met British actor Joshua Sasse, who was 28 at the time. They became engaged the following year before splitting in 2017

When Lorraine asked if she had any plans to marry her partner, Kylie merely batted away the question while bushing and exclaiming: 'Lorraine!'

Proving the strength of their love, she later said of their romance: Yeah I did [get a magical feeling] actually. Maybe not quite like a romance novel, where there are butterflies and stars start shooting through the air! But yeah, definitely.

'All my friends said to me, 'You were acting different.' And that's when I knew that there was something. Because I thought I was acting cool but maybe I wasn't.'

Kylie told how she and Paul got together after a mutual friend suggested they meet but it took her a while before she agreed to it.

She said: 'I wasn't interested in meeting anyone at that point, so I kept saying, 'Yeah, but no - one day.' Anyway, eventually that day happened and yeah, we connected, we liked each other.

Last year, she sweetly revealed that Paul has even charmed her 100-year-old grandma after making a 'special effort' when he first met her in Australia last year.

She said: 'She turned 100 last December and Paul did come to Australia for that. I think he flew in the day before so he was absolutely sideways with jetlag. It was like Meet The Parents times 100…

'He did charm them all and he actually made a special effort.

'He might kill me for saying this but he would look up some Welsh sayings and just go to Google and hear how to say tiny Welsh phrases. My granny absolutely loved it.'

The engagement is a change of pace from Kylie's previous words, as she had insisted she would never get married following her engagement to Joshua.

In 2018, she said: 'I never thought I would get married. Just going through 'being engaged' seems like an experiment, because I'd never, as a girl or in all my life, had a vision of getting married.

'It's not something I needed or wanted. My parents never brought me up with the idea of 'the big marriage'. I never had it as a goal.'

Sweet! In October it was then reported by New Idea that the pair were planning to marry in Melbourne this year, depending on the outcome of the COVID-19 (the couple pictured in March last year)

KYLIE'S CHEQUERED, TRAGIC AND VERY PUBLIC LOVE LIFE

Kylie has had a long string of public romances, which began when she burst on to screens in Neighbours in the Eighties, where she struck up a relationship with her on-screen love, played by Jason Donovan.

Loved-up: The duo played Scott and Charlene and the characters wed in an iconic wedding that was broadcast in Australia in July 1987

After three years as a couple, the couple struggled with distance as both their stars went on the rise and Kylie met and fell in love with tragic Michael Hutchence.

Speaking about the split in 2016, Jason said: 'It was an extremely painful parting of the ways and, without a doubt, I took a long time to recover from it. Years...

'Years, definitely. It was bad enough that she'd run off with anybody, but she happened to run into the arms of the greatest rock god of the period, the very guy who I secretly wanted to be. That was a pretty big punch to take...

'I've since bumped into Kylie quite a few times. The break-up never comes up in conversation. We're not close enough to get into that.

Painful: Speaking about the split in 2016, Jason said: 'It was an extremely painful parting of the ways and, without a doubt, I took a long time to recover from it. Years'

Later in 1989, Kylie met late rocker Michael, who she started seeing after a gig in Australia, although she admitted they were 'polar opposites'.

She described his as 'a dark bad boy and I was the pure good girl,'and revealed their romance started with faxes to each other's hotels, using fake names, 'Gabby Jones' for her and 'Swordfish' for him, so no one would know.

Kylie detailed in a recent documentary: 'He had insatiable curiosity, all the good things in life and some the bad. He opened up a whole new world for me. A lot of it was based around pleasure, let's face it.'

Opposites: Later in 1989, Kylie met late rocker Michael, who she started seeing after a gig in Australia, although she admitted they were 'polar opposites'

She previously recalled: 'I met a new person and I fell in love. Yes, he was this wild guy, he was the rocker, he was all of that.

'But I'm always at pains to say he was Byron-esque, he was poetic, he was cultured and hilarious and tender, he was all of these other things.'

She continued: 'I guess, I was at the perfect age, I was 21 years old, to get the butterfly wings and go out into the world and we collided at that time and I guess he just fast-tracked some of it. Anyway, it was a glorious time. I loved it.'

Things ended in disaster however, when he flew her from Japan to New York in 1991 to tell he wanted to break up with her: 'He was on the floor, on all fours, crying. Was it work, was it the drugs? I don't know. He was like a broken man.

Just five years later, he took his own life in a hotel room after taking a cocktail of drugs. Kylie was at the funeral, where his then-lover Paula Yates is said to have put a gram of cocaine in his pocket as mourners paid respects to his open casket.

In 1991, Kylie enjoyed a brief fling with rocker Lenny Kravitz.

From 1996 to 1998, Kylie enjoyed a romance with director Stéphane Sednaoui. Her hit track Breathe was written when the duo travelled to Tokyo together.

Kylie dated model James Gooding from 1999 to 2002 but he later boasted of flying out to New York and cheating on her with model Sophie Dahl.

Kylie was said to be 'furious' when he did a tell-all interview about her. Other stars who had romances with Gooding also slammed him, with former girlfriend Martine McCutcheon describing him as 'disgusting'.

She then dated French actor Olivier Martinez for five years before the couple called it quits in February 2007.

A joint statement released on behalf of the pair at the time read: 'Olivier Martinez and Kylie Minogue have officially confirmed that they are no longer a couple. They have made it clear that the decision to go their separate ways was mutual and amicable.

'The media's false accusations of disloyalty have saddened them both. The two remain very close friends.'

The separation came at the end of a tumultuous time for Kylie after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The singer was forced to abandon her Showgirl world tour in May 2005, and did not resume it until November 2006.

The singer spoke of how her 'incredible' boyfriend of four years had helped her through the battle.

'On particular dark days, I'd be lying on the bathroom floor wailing and he'd say, ""OK, honey, you can cry for just five minutes, then I'm taking you on the bike for a ride around Paris""' she told Elle magazine in 2006.

'So I'd howl a bit more and then I'd find myself thinking, ""Hmm. Actually, a ride on the bike sounds pretty good"".'Olli was there all the time, helping with the practical stuff and being protective.'

Happier days: She then dated French actor Olivier Martinez for five years before the couple called it quits in February 2007

At the time she denied reports the couple were planning to marry. 'I understand the excitement at the prospect of a wedding, but we're simply happy together and getting on with life,' she said.

In 2008, Kylie began dating model Andrés Velencoso after they met while filming an advert for her perfume range in 2008.

Things ended in 2013, when Kylie terminated their five-year relationship and cited the pressures of their conflicting work schedules as the reason for the split.

Her representative confirmed the break-up to The Sun On Sunday, insisting at the time they were still on good terms.

In 2008, Kylie began dating model Andrés Velencoso after they met while filming an advert for her perfume range in 2008.

Friends later said her increased workload had led to them spending less time together over months leading up to the split.

‘Kylie and Andrés haven’t been spending much time together because she’s been holed up in the studio in LA working on her new album,’ said a source. ‘He’s also been trying to carve out an acting career for himself.

‘When she signed up for The Voice they knew they couldn’t cope with the long distance pressures the job would put on them.’

The news came only 12-months after Kylie said of her then-boyfriend: ‘He’s the one. Sound the alarm, four years. I think I’m pretty settled'.

In 2015, Kylie met British actor Joshua Sasse, who was 28 at the time. They became engaged the following year before splitting in 2017.

In 2018, Kylie spoke with Red Magazine about her split from Joshua, telling the publication she'd had to 'rebuild herself physically and mentally' after the break-up.

She later told The Sunday Times the split had caused her to have a 'nervous breakdown'. At the time of their split , it was reported that Kylie had suspected Joshua was cheating on her with actress Marta Milans, but this was never confirmed.",Kylie Minogue flashes sparkler on her ring finger after revelation she is engaged to Paul Solomons

A new documentary has explored the dark side of the singer's fame, from her rise as a childhood star to her 2007 breakdown and her father's controversial 13-year conservatorship, which launched the #FreeBritney movement.

Framing Britney Spears aired on Friday night and reassesses her phenomenal career and downfall, as the songstress battles her father Jamie in court over who should control her life.

Britney, 39, is locked in a legal battle to remove her father as her conservator - a role he has had since 2008 after her notorious meltdown.

Laid bare: A new documentary has explored the dark side of the singer's fame, from her rise as a childhood star to her 2007 breakdown and her father's controversial 13-year conservatorship, which launched the #FreeBritney movement.

The new film, which was directed by Samantha Stark and produced by the New York Times, appeared on Hulu this Friday before being televised on FX that same evening.

It begins with a montage of the #FreeBritney movement, including courthouse protests and social media videos.

An in-person protest is accompanied by the slogan: 'What do we want? Free Britney! When do we want it? Now!'

The movement was sparked after Britney began a legal fight to have Jamie removed from her conservatorship, with her lawyer arguing that 'she is afraid of her father' and 'will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career.'

Although Jamie no longer holds the conservatorship over her 'person' he does over estate thereby restricting, for example, her ability to make financial decisions.

After Britney suffered an infamous breakdown and lost custody of her two sons she was placed in the conservatorship of Jamie and a lawyer called Andrew Wallet.

But in the documentary the pop star's friend and ex-assistant Felicia Culotta said she knows 'firsthand' what Britney is 'capable of.'

The show also features interview footage with Adam Streisand - a lawyer she spoke to previously about the conservatorship around the time it first began.

Troubled past: After Britney suffered an infamous breakdown and lost custody of her two sons she was placed in the conservatorship of Jamie and a lawyer called Andrew Wallet

She was unable to actually have Adam represent her on account of a judge who ruled that she could not hire her own lawyer and needed a court-appointed one.

Adam acknowledged that the judge saw medical records that he himself did not but still felt Britney 'was capable of retaining me and directing me and that the judge should have allowed that to happen.'

His conclusion was drawn from his discussions with her where she was aware that her conservatorship was inescapable but just wanted Jamie out of his position.

Fan support: Andrew gave up his post in 2019 and last year Britney began a legal fight to have Jamie removed from her conservatorship

The way the family was: Britney's lawyer has argued that 'she is afraid of her father' and 'will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career'

Another one of the interviewees in the documentary is Jive Records marketing executive Kim Kaiman who worked with Britney early on in her career.

'The only thing Jamie ever said to me was: ""My daughter is going to be so rich she’s going to buy me a boat,"" That’s all I’m gonna say about Jamie,' said Kim who said that it was Britney's mother Lynn who 'supported' her at this time.

'These are letters to me from the fans so if I got this many you can imagine, oh, the ones that Britney got would fill up the entire room,' said Felicia before revealing her role in Britney's life.

Although she did not receive a specific ‘definition on what I was supposed to do’ in her care of Britney, titles like 'chaperone' were initially thrown around.

Felicia shared that 'at one point they wanted to call me her partner and we didn’t think that sounded right' and ultimately 'we settled on assistant.'

Nowadays: Shortly thereafter the audience are whisked off to McComb, Mississippi where Felicia shows the cameras around her house and opens a box of fan mail

Figuring it out: Felicia shared that 'at one point they wanted to call me her partner and we didn’t think that sounded right' and ultimately 'we settled on assistant'

'To be honest I didn’t then nor do I now understand what a conservatorship is especially for somebody Britney’s age and somebody capable of so much that I know firsthand she’s capable of,' said Felicia who has 'known her since she was five.'

Britney was subject to questionable scrutiny early on, appearing on Star Search in 1992 aged 11 and being asked by an adult male presenter: 'Do you have a boyfriend?'

'Of all the things that she could be asked about, because what else could we possibly talk to a woman or a girl about? There’s so much more to her that everybody’s missing,' noted Britney's ex-stylist Hayley Hill in the new film.

Agent Nancy Carson who represented child talent took up Britney's case and ‘Her mom was just so sweet, so proud of her daughter and her dad too was very proud of Britney and he was more concerned with the financial aspect of it.'

Analyzing the situation: Nancy said that Britney's 'dad too was very proud of Britney and he was more concerned with the financial aspect of it'

Nancy said Jamie wondered: 'How was he gonna be able to make this happen? Could he make it happen? But I know he wanted to make it happen for her.’

Calling Britney 'a funny, sweet, wonderful little girl,' Nancy explained that her talent and Lynn moved up to New York for training and auditions.

'All this led to the Mickey Mouse Club audition and she nailed it,' said Nancy, revealing Britney 'loved' the job 'and when it ended it was devastating.'

Britney, who was born in McComb and brought up in Kentwood, Louisiana, went back down south for a brief interregnum as a regular high school girl.

But when Britney got a record deal Felicia was enlisted to travel with her - at the request of Lynn who was raising her younger daughter Jamie-Lynn.

Kim told the documentarians that Felicia 'was really sitting in for the parents,' adding that Britney was 'serious' and 'focused' with regard to her work.

Jamie was battling various personal problems - drinking, a failed gym business, bankruptcy - and according to Kim: 'Lynn supported Britney.'

She was only 16 years old when in 1998 her ...Baby One More Time single and video catapulted her to global pop superstardom.

During Britney's teen stardom she was heavily sexualized both in her songs and videos and in the media coverage of her.

As she grew into adulthood she was needled by journalists about her breasts and the question of whether she was a virgin.

In her early 20s in 2003 Britney sat for an interview with Diane Sawyer - who played a clip of Maryland's First Lady Kendall Erlich saying figuratively that 'if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears I think I would,' a remark for which she later apologized.

When Britney got over her shock at the remark she managed to counterargue that ‘I’m not here to, you know, babysit her kids.'

'I’ll say this, you know,' said Hayley in her interview. 'I worked with all the boy bands, all of ‘em - not one of the boys was ever under any scrutiny.'

Britney found herself in crisis when she got involved with boy band star Justin Timberlake - who then blamed her for the breakup in his single Cry Me A River.

In a flash Britney was widely portrayed as the villainess and even Diane Sawyer took an accusatory tone, asking her: 'What did you do?'

All the same all of the criticism ultimately made her 'more free' as she was 'less concerned with pleasing everybody,' Hayley contended.

Rehearsal footage showed Britney responding to the accusation of being a 'diva' by saying: 'I’m not a diva! I know what I like and I know what I want.'

Kevin Tancharoen, who was a backup dancer and her tour director for five years early in her career, dished: 'She was definitely in control of a lot of decisions.'

He went on: 'That idea that Britney is a puppet who just gets moved around and told what to do is incredibly inaccurate. When I was involved in all of those years, we would present a lot of ideas. She would have to like them and she would have to approve them. She was very creative.'

Kevin added: 'She was the one who knew what she wanted to do, and she would make that happen or her people would make that happen for her.’

She explained: 'And you just control what you do, you know? You have to otherwise you get sucked in by people that are not necessary.'

Ultimately Britney married sizzling rap hunk Kevin Federline in 2004 and then they welcome two sons - Preston, 15, and Jayden, 14.

When she had a scandal after being photographed driving with her baby in her lap, her defense was that Jamie did the same with her when she was little.

She filed for divorce from Kevin just weeks after Jayden was born and according to her mother's memoir was also undergoing postpartum depression.

Initially Britney seemed at ease with the paparazzi attention but began to feel increasingly beleaguered by it.

In late 2007 she lost custody of Preston and Jayden but was still able to visit them amid her progressive public deterioration.

Infamously she shaved her head because ‘I’m tired of everybody touching me,' and then was then snapped whaling on a photographer's truck with an umbrella.

'It’s so easy, it’s so much fun to take a celebrity who’s a young beautiful talented girl and rip her to shreds,' remarked Kim bleakly.

The Toxic singer in short order took up with Sam Lutfi who became her manager and was, according to the documentary, loathed by her parents.

Then one notorious evening she was hospitalized after allegedly barring herself in a room with the children instead of giving them over to Kevin as directed.

Britney for a time lost even visitation rights to the children - and Jamie soon obtained the temporary conservatorship that became permanent.

Vivian Lee Thoreen, who was part of Jamie's legal team around this time, explained that 'having a conservator of the estate appointed for someone is that they are substantially unable to manage their financial affairs or they are susceptible to undue influence or fraud.'

The attorney, who not long after speaking to the documentary got back into Jamie's legal team, said: 'It’s more than just: ""I can’t balance my checkbook."" It’s: ""I could be duped into giving away my money.""'

The Spears parents alleged in legal documents that Sam ‘crushed pills into Britney’s food’ and was ‘exerting total control over’ the pop star, obtaining a restraining order despite his denials of their accusations.

At the beginning Jamie held the personal conservatorship, whilst he and Andrew Wallet shared the estate conservatorship.

Adam Streisand, a lawyer who is famous for cases about celebrity estates and who happens to be Barbra Streisand's cousin, gave his two cents as well.

Near the start of the conservatorship he took a meeting with Britney at the Beverly Hills Hotel ‘and the first question I had was: ""Does Britney have the capacity to be able to hire me? Does she have the ability to take my advice?""

'So the first thing is Britney was able to make the judgment: “Hey, I get what’s going on. I get that I’m not gonna be able to resist this conservatorship or avoid this conservatorship, right?” So that’s a pretty sound judgement,' Adam argued.

'The second thing was, she said: ""I don’t want my father to be the conservator."" That was her one request. She wanted a professional, somebody independent.'

'That was her one request': 'The second thing was, she said: ""I don’t want my father to be the conservator,""' Adam revealed in the documentary

Acknowledging the judge had seen the medical records and he had not Adam said: 'I felt that based on my interactions with Britney that she was capable of retaining me and directing me and that the judge should have allowed that to happen.'

Shortly before reentering Jamie's legal team Vivian commented: 'Of the cases that I have been involved with I have not seen a conservatee who has successfully terminated a conservatorship.'

At the dawn of the conservatorship the pop star shot an MTV documentary called Britney: For The Record and emotionally discussed the matter.

’If I wasn’t under the restraints that I’m under right now, you know, with all the lawyers and doctors and people analyzing me everyday and all that kind of stuff, like if that wasn’t there I’d feel so liberated and feel like myself,' she said.

'They're hearing what they wanna hear': 'When I tell them the way I feel it’s like they hear me but they’re really not listening,' said Britney of the 'lawyers and doctors' involved in her care

'When I tell them the way I feel it’s like they hear me but they’re really not listening. They’re hearing what they wanna hear. They’re not really listening to what I’m telling them. It’s like...it’s bad. I’m sad,' Britney continued, fighting back tears.

Britney rapidly began performing again and eventually managed a major comeback including hit singles like Work B**** and a Las Vegas residency that began in 2013.

Felicia was hired by the touring company in a much reduced role from the one she once had when Britney was rising to superstardom as a teen.

'I took a backseat and simply did what I was hired to do,' said Felicia, noting: ‘I don’t really know what went on. I just don’t know that they knew her well enough to realize her capabilities in making the decisions. Just me looking in, that’s what I saw.'

Jamie got 1.5% of gross revenues from the residency - and then in 2018 Andrew Wallet petitioned the courts for more money, arguing that ‘this conservatorship should be viewed more as a hybrid business model.'

Britney canceled her second residency prematurely on grounds of her father's recent hospitalization and stopped posting on Instagram.

In early 2019 Andrew mysteriously removed himself from his role in the conservatorship of Britney's estate - leaving Jamie there alone.

By the end of that year the conservatorship battle was raging between Britney and Jamie and the #FreeBritney movement was gaining steam.

During the whole media frenzy around the matter her brother Bryan gave an interview confessing ‘she’s always wanted to get out of’ the conservatorship.

In legal documents Britney said she wanted 'a qualified corporate fiduciary' in charge of her estate rather than her father.

The documents also alluded to the singer being ‘vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,’ acknowledging ‘the whole world is watching.'

Last a year a judge declined to remove Jamie from his role 'today' but added Bessemer Trust Company - which Britney picked out - as co-conservator.

'And I am so grateful for when that point comes that she’s able to sit down and, you know, everything will fall into place.'

The New York Times noted that Britney's parents and siblings, as well as Sam Lufti and her current lawyer Samuel Ingham, would not film interviews for the movie.

''The New York Times attempted to reach Britney Spears directly to request her participation in this project,' they added. 'It is unclear if she received the requests.'",Britney Spears doc shines light on legal battle

And Lewis Hamilton appeared keen to distract himself from the ongoing drama on Friday, when he was spotted jewellery shopping at Beverly Hills' XIV Karats Ltd.

The racecar driver, 36, departed his spending spree in style, exiting the upscale establishment sporting a neck full of blinding bling as he drove off in his £140,000 2000 Porsche Taycan Turbo S.

Bling: Lewis Hamilton was spotted jewellery shopping at Beverly Hills' XIV Karats Ltd on Friday

Sources tell MailOnline that the Hertfordshire-native more than three hours in the tony jewellery store, located just a stone's throw away from the famed Rodeo Drive.

He stepped out in casually cool style for the solo excursion, sporting a cream sweater emblazoned with the word 'optimism', which he teamed with a pair of matching jogging bottoms and box fresh white Jordans.

Adhering by COVID-19 safety protocols, he wore a white face mask, while he shielded his eyes from the Southern California sunshine with a pair of stylish shades.

Lewis' spending spree comes amid reports he's been locked in a contract stand off with Mercedes as both sides struggle to settle on a new deal.

Mercedes has just a month to tie him down and the length of a new deal appears to be the sticking point with the Silver Arrows only willing to offer him a one-year deal.

It would be a PR disaster to at least not have Lewis on board by March 2 to help unveil Mercedes' new car they hope can lead them to double world championship glory for the eighth season in a row.

Meanwhile, the star's social life has been under the spotlight over the past week, after American model Grace Lindley was spotted leaving his Beverly Hills hotel cabana on Monday morning.

Grace was seen emerging from the same cabana as Lewis, moments before the star sheepishly made his way towards his parked Mercedes at around 9.30am.

Hamilton is relaxing in California after testing positive for COVID-19 less than 24-hours after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix on November 29th. He has since made a full recovery.

Lewis updated his fans in January on how he was feeling as he continued working on his fitness after recovering from the physical effects of COVID-19.

The driver has embarked on a gruelling fitness regime which involved altitude training and admitted a stay at an undisclosed mountain location had a positive impact on his mental and physical health.

Taking to Instagram, he wrote: 'Hey World, I haven’t been on here for a while. I’m in the mountains training everyday, getting my mind and body right.

'I’m hiking to the top of the mountain every morning. 3 of those hikes I cross country ski once I get to the top which is at 3400m, killer.

'I love altitude training, there is less oxygen high up so working out is much harder than at sea level, just walking up the stairs you feel it at 2000m. Normally when I finish training here and return to sea level running is such a breeze.'

Model: His social life has attracted quite the spotlight over the past week, after American model Grace Lindley was spotted leaving his Beverly Hills hotel cabana on Monday morning

He added: 'I’m trying to find the right balance in cardio and strength building. On top of that, lots of work ongoing in the background. Many moving parts but just checking in to let you know I’m doing good, I’m healthy and mentally strong right now in my bubble.

'I hope you are staying as positive as you can with all that is still going on. Keep your head up. I can’t wait to see you all again at some stage soon. Sending you love and light.'

The Formula 1 champion previously revealed he lost almost a stone in weight and had 'really low strength' after contracting the virus towards the end of last year.

Taking to Instagram in December, he shared a picture of himself in the gym and wrote: 'I've lost 6kg over the past two months. Four of which I lost when I got Covid.

'I've lost so much muscle. Starting from a low point in strength now, not fun but I'm determined to get my strength back and to be 100 per cent again. No pain, no gain.'

After testing positive, Hamilton spent 10 days in isolation at the start of December and admitted he had 'one of the hardest weeks in some time' after getting the result.

He finished third at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday 13 December, saying he felt 'destroyed' and just 'happy to be alive' after his race return.

The sportsman had previously taken to Twitter to thank his fans for their support while isolating in his hotel room in Bahrain, after the news of his positive COVID-19 test broke on December 1.

He said: 'It's definitely been one of the hardest weeks that I've had in some time. Just been focusing on recovering and getting back in shape so I can get back in the car and race the final race in Abu Dhabi.

Contract: Lewis' spending spree comes amid reports he's been locked in a contract stand off with Mercedes as both sides struggle to settle on a new deal. Pictured in December

'I woke up today feeling great and got my first workout in early so wanted to send you guys positivity and let you know I'm OK... I hope that wherever you are, you're staying positive and fighting through whatever you're facing. I hope that I can get back in the car soon. And I'm sending you guys love.'

It was revealed on December 1 that Lewis had tested positive for COVID-19 with the star missing the Sakhir Grand Prix and he faced an anxious wait to see if he will be able to take part in the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP.

However, before his Covid result and the undoubtedly stressful end of the F1 season, Lewis was seen enjoying a yacht trip with glamorous model Florence Mueller in September.

With her long limbs, toned abs and luscious raven locks, Florence bore a striking resemblance to his former flame, Nicole Scherzinger.

Deal: Mercedes has just a month to tie him down and the length of a new deal appears to be the sticking point with the Silver Arrows only willing to offer him a one-year deal. Pictured in 2020

But a source speaking to The Sun on Sunday claimed that Lewis and the model were strictly friends, as they claimed they were 'just good mates.'

The inside said: 'Lewis and Florence aren’t dating, they’re just good mates. She joined him on the boat as part of a group of pals with Lewis. They get on but there’s nothing romantic going on between them at the moment.'

MailOnline has contacted Lewis' representatives for comment at the time.

Lewis and Nicole called time on their on and off eight year relationship in 2015 but have remained amicable, reuniting at the Fashion Awards in London in December 2019.

The former Pussycat Doll is now dating retired British rugby player Thom Evans after meeting on Celebrity X Factor at the end of 2019.

Meanwhile, Lewis has been linked to a strong of women since ending his eight-year relationship with Nicole.

Model Barbara Palvin, Winnie Harlow and Kendall Jenner, singers Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Rita Ora, and young socialite Sofia Richie have all been romantically connected to the star over the ensuing four years.

Back in July, Russian model Viktoria Odintcova spoke out to claim that she had a romantic relationship with the star shortly after his split from his longterm girlfriend.

Ex factor: Lewis famously dated Nicole Scherzinger for eight years on and off until 2015 (pictured left in 2014)

The 26-year-old brunette beauty claimed that Formula 1 world champ Lewis pursued her four years ago, after parting ways with the former Pussycat Doll though she insists they're now just friends.

RT quotes her as saying: 'We had different types of relationship. At a certain period of time it was romantic. He was courting me.

'But then this relationship evolved into friendship. I live in Russia and he lives abroad. We just became friends who can message each other and send holiday greetings.'

Viktoria reportedly revealed that the pair met in Barcelona four years ago, before exchanging direct messages on Instagram, though they're not just friends.",Lewis Hamilton sports new bling as he drives £140k Porsche Taycan in Beverly Hills

Hammer is accused of a host of shocking allegations recently with the leak of social media messages which included fantasies of cannibalism, graphic sexual experiences, abuse and a BDSM fetish.

The controversy around the 34-year-old actor sees him accused of emotional and physical abuse by a number of women.

But on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night, the comedian suggested that the women involved would have known what they were getting themselves into from the very start.

On his HBO talk show, Bill Maher, defended Hollywood actor Armie Hammer suggesting the women involved 'knew what they were getting themselves into.'

Armie Hammer has been rocked by disturbing claims of cannibalism and violating BDSM practices with multiple women, which his lawyer has denied

'I think we can talk about this in relation to where feminism is, because apparently, Armie Hammer has a predilection to tell his dates he wants to 'eat' them. And who wouldn't want to be eaten by Armie Hammer? Come on,' Maher started.

'Apparently this is something called 'ethical human cannibal fetishism.' No actual women were eaten in the making of this movie. They were just talking. They have his texts, where he was saying things like, 'I want to take your rib out and boil it with barbecue sauce,' says Maher.

'We're in such a porn-centric society—people have been watching really hardcore porn for so long that 'spank you' doesn't really cut it anymore.

'My point is that the women who are objecting to this now, who went out with Armie Hammer—willingly—and stayed in—willingly—and there wasn't physical bad stuff happening, OK… we can all agree that's intolerable—but if there wasn't any physical coercion, why isn't this just filed under, 'That seemed like a good idea at the time—to let Armie Hammer eat me—but it really wasn't.' It seems like we don't have any ownership anymore of our own choices.'

Hammer began trending online earlier this month after a series of sexually graphic Instagram DMs that he allegedly wrote to a woman were leaked publicly by an anonymous, now-private account, House of Effie.

The leaked Instagram messages saw Hammer allegedly express fantasies of cannibalism, rape, and kidnapping to women.

The messages then became conflated with actual allegations of coercion and emotional and physical abuse.

As a result, he has exited multiple film projects in recent weeks over graphic messages he allegedly sent several women over social media.

Hammer also was dropped Friday by his talent agency, WME, and his publicist has stepped away from working with him as well.

Maher said the women who went out with Hammer did so 'willingly' and 'should have known what they were in for'

Armie's ex-lover, Paige Lorenze, told The Kyle and Jackie O Show that he allegedly wanted to remove one of her ribs and eat it.

'In non-sexual settings he asked me on multiple occasions to remove my ribs,' she said. 'He wanted to find a doctor in LA to like, remove the ribs that I don't need. And he wanted to, like, he has a smoker at his house in L.A. and he wanted to smoke it and eat it.'

The model admitted that she took it as 'dark humor' at first, before he made the request 'five times' — to the point that she believed it was more of a 'serious thing.'

'He would always say, ""I wonder what it tastes like, I bet it tastes good,"" stuff like that,' she claimed.

When asked if she thought the actor would have really eaten her ribs, Lorenze responded firmly: '100 percent.'

Hammer's ex-girlfriend, Courtney Vucekovich, told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview that the star was into 'master-slave fetishes' and told her he wanted to break and eat her ribs

The Dallas-based app founder said she met Hammer in June through mutual friends, and from the beginning he was 'intoxicating.'

'He's a very charming, intense human being. But once you start talking to him, he's pretty aggressive right from the start. Not violent, but just sexually aggressive in the way he speaks,' she said.

Another woman, 22-year-old Paige Lorenze, claimed Hammer sent around nude photos of her to other people without her consent and then emotionally manipulated her into letting him bruise her

Another woman, 22-year-old Paige Lorenze, claimed Hammer sent around nude photos of her to other people without her consent and then emotionally manipulated her into letting him bruise her, encouraging her to 'show off' the marks and to 'be proud' of them.

She claimed to Page Six that Hammer 'enjoyed hurting women, but used BDSM as a mask for this,' and claims that she has been undergoing in trauma therapy since the ordeal.

On Maher's show, Real Time, he defended Hammer suggesting that everything between the women was 'consensual'.

'I think he is exactly the guy in the book Fifty Shades of Grey, which was the most popular book ever, I think, with women… He's this rich, handsome, movie star guy, and he's got a kink.'

A panelist on the show, Time journalist Charlotte Alter, noted that some physicality occurred between Hammer and his accusers.

'Some of the women have alleged that there was sort of some slapping around. One woman said he carved his initials into her body,' Alter added.

'Did he tie her down and do that?' asked Maher. 'I don't think so.'

Maher went on to blame Hammer's accusers: 'If you're gonna swim with the alpha sharks, it's not gonna come out well in the end. Shouldn't you know that? I mean, is it really that hard to figure out without the law getting involved?' claimed Maher, adding, 'He's a cad!'

A lawyer for Hammer has categorically denied the allegations against him, calling them 'patently untrue'.

Christopher Plummer died aged 91 in his Connecticut home after falling and hitting his head - as his Sound of Music co-star Julie Andrews led the tributes, calling him a 'consummate actor' and a 'cherished friend'.

Plummer, the dashing award-winning Canadian actor who played Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music, died early Friday morning with his wife of 53 years, Elaine Taylor, by his side.

He suffered a head injury after falling, the New York Times reports. Plummer is survived by Elaine and his actress daughter, Amanda, from his first of three marriages.

Leading the tributes after his death, his co-star Julie Andrews said in statement: 'I treasure the memories of our work together and all the humour and fun we shared through the years.

'My heart and condolences go out to his lovely wife Elaine and his daughter Amanda.'

An accomplished Shakespearean actor honored for his varied stage, television and film work in a career that spanned more than six decades, Plummer became the oldest Academy Award acting winner in history at the age of 82 in 2012.

'Chris was an extraordinary man who deeply loved and respected his profession with great old fashion manners, self deprecating humor and the music of words,' his longtime friend and manager Lou Pitt said in a statement confirming his death.

'He was a National Treasure who deeply relished his Canadian roots. Through his art and humanity, he touched all of our hearts and his legendary life will endure for all generations to come. He will forever be with us.'

Plummer appeared in more than 100 films and also was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Russian author Leo Tolstoy in 2009's 'The Last Station.' He won two Tony Awards for his Broadway work, two Emmy Awards for TV work and performed for some of the world's top theater companies.

But for many fans his career was defined by his performance alongside Andrews as a stern widower in 'The Sound Of Music'.

Oscar winning actor Christopher Plummer died in his Connecticut home early Friday morning aged 91

The Canadian actor died early Friday morning at his home in Connecticut with his wife of 53 years, Elaine Taylor, by his side. The couple are pictured above together in 2015

Andrews played the part of a nun named Maria, who falls hopelessly in love with Captain von Trapp. Both actors were in dissolving marriages during at the time of production and Plummer found happiness by going out every night in Austria, playing piano at local bars and drinking in hotels.

Despite a mutual attraction for one another, their on-screen romance never translated to real life. 'We should have ended up together,' he told ABC News in 2015.

'We should have had a huge smashing affair.

He lamented the role of von Trapp as 'a cardboard figure, humorless and one-dimensional'. He once described the film as something that followed him through his career like an 'albatross'. In his 2008 autobiography 'In Spite Of Myself,' Plummer refers to the movie with the mischievous acronym 'S&M.'

It took him four decades to change his view of the film and embrace it as a 'terrific movie' that made him proud.

Director Robert Wise's wholesome, sentimental film follows the singing von Trapp family and their 1938 escape from the Nazis. Plummer's character falls in love with Andrews, the nun hired to care for his seven children. The movie won the Academy Award as best picture of 1965.

'Originally I had accepted Robert Wise's offer simply because I wanted to find out what it was like to be in a musical comedy,' Plummer wrote in his book. 'I had a secret plan to one day turn 'Cyrano de Bergerac' into a Broadway musical. 'S&M' would therefore be a perfect workout in preparation for such an event.'

He said he had never sung before in my life - 'not even in the shower' - before taking a role that included crooning the song 'Edelweiss.' He blamed his own 'vulgar streak' for the desire to star in a big, splashy Hollywood extravaganza.

'And yes, all right, I'll admit it, I was also a pampered, arrogant, young ba*****, spoiled by too many great theater roles,' he wrote. 'Ludicrous though it may seem, I still harbored the old-fashioned stage actor's snobbism toward moviemaking.'

Plummer appeared in more than 100 films but for many fans his career was defined by his performance as an stern widower in 'The Sound Of Music' alongside Julie Andrews

For many fans his career was defined by his performance as an stern widower in 'The Sound Of Music' - a role he called 'a cardboard figure, humorless and one-dimensional.'

The role catapulted Plummer to stardom, but he never took to leading men parts, despite his silver hair, good looks and ever-so-slight English accent. He preferred character parts, considering them more meaty.

Plummer flourished in a succession of meaty roles after age 70 - a time in life when most actors merely fade away. He claimed a long-awaited Academy Award at age 82 for his supporting performance in 'Beginners' as an elderly man who comes out of the closet as gay after his wife's death.

Plummer is survived by his third wife Elaine Taylor and his actress daughter, Amanda Plummer, from his first marriage

'You're only two years older than me, darling,' Plummer, who was born in 1929, said to his golden statuette - first given for films made in 1927 and 1928 - at the February 2012 Oscars ceremony.

'Where have you been all my life?'

Plummer became the oldest actor to win a competitive Academy Award - supplanting Jessica Tandy and George Burns, who both were 80 when they won theirs.

Plummer's late-career renaissance began with director Michael Mann's 'The Insider' (1999) in which he portrayed CBS News interviewer Mike Wallace, acting alongside Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.

That was followed by triumphs in director Ron Howard's Academy Award best picture winner 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001), director Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' (2006), 'Up' and 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' (both 2009) and 'Barrymore' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (both 2011).

'Too many people in the world are unhappy with their lot. And then they retire and they become vegetables. I think retirement in any profession is death, so I'm determined to keep crackin',' he told the Associated Press in 2011.

Plummer's early films included 1965's 'Inside Daisy Clover' with Natalie Wood and Robert Redford, released the same year as 'The Sound Of Music,' 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964) with Sophia Loren and Alec Guinness, and 'Triple Cross' (1966).

Among his more colorful roles were as an eye-patch-wearing Klingon in 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country' (1991) and as an urbane jewel thief in 'The Return of the Pink Panther' (1975). He said he kicked himself for turning down the Gandalf role in the popular 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.

Plummer in 2017 replaced Kevin Spacey as J. Paul Getty in 'All the Money in the World' just six weeks before the film was set to hit theaters. That choice that was officially validated in the best possible way for the film - a supporting Oscar nomination for Plummer, his third

In 2019, he starred in the TV suspense drama series 'Departure.'

Among his more colorful roles were as an eye-patch-wearing Klingon in the 1991 film 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'

One of his last major role was as another patriarch, in the dark-comedy 'Knives Out' in 2019.

His TV roles included the 1983 mini-series 'The Thorn Birds.'

'For a long time, I accepted parts that took me to attractive places in the world. Rather than shooting in the Bronx, I would rather go to the south of France, crazed creature than I am,' he told AP in 2007.

'And so I sacrificed a lot of my career for nicer hotels and more attractive beaches.'

He performed most of the major Shakespeare roles, including Hamlet, Cyrano, Iago, Othello, Prospero, Henry V and a staggering 'King Lear' at Lincoln Center in 2004. He was frequent star at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada.

'I've become simpler and simpler with playing Shakespeare,' he said in 2007. 'I'm not as extravagant as I used to be. I don't listen to my voice so much anymore. All the pitfalls of playing the classics - you can fall in love with yourself.'

As a dazzling Shakespearian actor, Plummer long showed his disregard and snobbery toward the Hollywood film set. He dismissively dubbed his biggest hit, ''The Sound Of Mucus' and 'S&M.'

'I was sadly deluded. Oh, I was proud that in the theater I had at least learned the power to command, but once off-stage my real existence had little in it to write home about – I was in serious trouble. Barry the Bartender was kept busy watering my drinks.'

Plummer was born in Toronto on December 13, 1929, into a privileged railroad family. He was the great-grandson of Sir John Abbott, the third prime minister of Canada. His parents divorced shortly after his birth.

Plummer had a turbulent reputation for being arrogant, with a foul temper and prone to tantrums. As the pampered only-child of the distinguished Canadian political family, Plummer had a privileged childhood.

Raised mostly by nannys, he fondly recalled his favorite governess, 'My French nanny kissed me at a very tender age,' he told The Guardian. 'It was long and tempting – my first real turn-on.

In his memoirs, Plummer reveled in his arrogance, admitted that he was often 'a pampered, arrogant, young ba*****'. He added, 'My family's correctness and high standards had made me want to be the bad boy always, convinced it made me more interesting and would bring me more attention.'

He confessed to a boozy lifestyle with plenty of affairs through the 1960s. He said his third wife, British actress Elaine Taylor, forced him after their 1970 marriage to stop the carousing that consumed some of his peers and friends, such as Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.

'Yeah, I stopped,' he told Britain's Telegraph newspaper in 2010. 'Square son of a bitch that I was, coward that I was! No, Elaine did say, 'If you don't quit this stupid over-drinking I'm outta here.' And thank God. She did in a sense save my life.'

Two ex-wives, a daughter and a string of affairs: Legendary playboy had a lengthy romantic history before settling down with his wife of 53 years

His first was to the American actress, Tammy Grimes (pictured), in 1956. They welcomed a daughter (Plummer's only child), Amanda Plummer in 1957. But the marriage was short lived and was over by 1960

Plummer has been married three times. His first was to the American actress, Tammy Grimes, in 1956. They welcomed a daughter (Plummer's only child), Amanda Plummer in 1957. But the marriage was short lived and was over by 1960.

In his autobiography, Plummer discussed how he was estranged from Amanda throughout her childhood because Grimes prohibited them from having contact. They established a relationship after Amanda became an adult, and she took after her father by pursuing of a career in acting.

The legendary playboy met his second wife, Patricia Lewis, in the early 1960s. The newspaper columnist had interviewed Plummer during his tenure at the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The actor was recently divorced from Grime and the new couple began a passionate romance that was made for good copy on Fleet Street.

Together, they hit up the best restaurants and nightclubs, including London's iconic 'The Establishment' with his famous friends Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and Peter Finch. Tragedy struck, however, after a long night of partying when Lewis crashed her Triumph convertible into a pillar outside Buckingham Palace.

Lewis sustain multiple facial fractures, a massive blood clot to her brain and was left in a coma. Plummer, miraculously, escaped with very few injuries, although he reportedly drank himself to sleep for weeks after.

Plummer took the earliest opportunity to marry Lewis after her long and painful recovery on May 4, 1962. They lived in a charming Queen Anne house in Mayfair where Lewis adequately recovered.

Their marriage was good for a while, but eventually broke down. Plummer had a reputation for developing crushes on his co-stars, including Julie Andrews and Natalie Wood (to name a few).

For her part, Lewis began drinking heavily too, and the couple officially divorced in 1967.

The father and daughter are pictured in 1990 with Plummer's third wife Elaine

Plummer met his third wife, English actress Elaine Taylor, in 1969 while filming a movie together in Ireland. At the time, Plummer had been carrying out an affair with the Welsh socialite, Elizabeth Rees-Williams, (while she was still married to the actor, Richard Harris).

Taylor's dyed red hair for the role on set is said to have appealed to Plummer. Fourteen years his junior, Taylor agreed to meet him again in London, provided that he throttled his bad drinking habit.

The couple married in 1970 and were happily wed, living in Weston, Connecticut until his death. He has referred to her as 'the greatest love of his life' and added that she is the person he most admires 'because she's beautiful, as wise as Solomon and a Cordon Bleu cook to boot.'

'How lucky I have been to have made the acquaintance of such an extraordinary collection of vagabonds,' Plummer wrote in his 2008 autobiography, In Spite of Myself. 'And how fortunate that the same century sent such remarkable women to show me the way.'

So long to Hollywood's grumpiest star: CHRISTOPHER STEVENS looks at the life of Christopher Plummer who had three failed marriages, an infamous temper and had to wait nearly half a century for his Oscar

Christopher Plummer always refused to refer to his most famous film by its real title. To him, it was The Sound Of Mucus, or S&M — a sly reference to sado-masochism.

Devoting a brief chapter of his 600-page autobiography to the perennial favourite — it won five Oscars in 1966, none of which was for him — he opened with a quote: ‘Watching The Sound Of Music is like being beaten to death by a Hallmark card.’

Plummer, who has died aged 91, played Captain Von Trapp, the widowed father of seven children, who hires a former nun to be their governess and falls in love with her.

Julie Andrews had the starring role as Maria and, though he was loath to admit it, Plummer felt intimidated.

Yes, he was a supremely gifted, spectacularly wilful actor, utterly confident of his own brilliance. But Miss Andrews was the beloved heroine of Mary Poppins, the woman with the voice of an angel who had triumphed on Broadway and the West End in My Fair Lady, too.

Plummer, on the other hand, couldn’t carry a tune in an Alpine rucksack. He didn’t even sing in the shower — and in the finished film, though he didn’t yet know it, his voice would be overdubbed.

‘I was stricken — absolutely terrified,’ he said, at the prospect of the recording studio.

When the producers, 20th Century Fox, asked him to tape a ‘guide track’, or early versions, of the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs to assist with filming the musical scenes, he flatly refused.

The actor demanded more time, and insisted he would walk off the picture if they made him sing.

The film company retaliated by threatening a $2million lawsuit. Eventually, he was flattered into line: studio chief Richard D. Zanuck visited the set and, in front of the cast, heaped praise on him until he agreed to return.

Even then, Plummer despised the part he had been given. Von Trapp was ‘very much a cardboard figure, humourless and one-dimensional . . . tepid . . . poor . . . soft-centred’.

Most actors would have welcomed the role as their big break. And Plummer, though he spent the 1950s playing supporting roles in TV dramas, had almost no film experience. Most audiences had never heard of him.

Yet he cheerfully boasted: ‘I was a pampered, arrogant young b*****d, spoiled by too many great theatre roles. Ludicrous though it may seem, I still harboured the old-fashioned stage actor’s snobbism toward movie-making.

‘The moment we arrived in Austria to shoot the exteriors, I was determined to present myself as a victim of circumstance — that I was doing the picture under duress, that it had been forced upon me, and that I certainly deserved better.’

He did add, with more than a hint of pride, that ‘my behaviour was unconscionable’. But it was small wonder that he gained a reputation during the making of The Sound Of Music, one he never lost, for being a rude, bullying, hard-drinking, priggish, loud-mouthed boor.

Yes, he was a supremely gifted, spectacularly wilful actor, utterly confident of his own brilliance. But Miss Andrews was the beloved heroine of Mary Poppins

One morning, badly hung over, he stormed on to the outdoor set and interrupted a take with Maria and the children.

He was being grossly insulted, he roared. Everyone on the production was ignorant and disrespectful, and if he didn’t receive grovelling apologies from everyone, from the director to the canteen crew, he would quit the picture. A quailing assistant director led Plummer off the set and, begging him to sit on a park bench, asked why he was so angry.

The actor fumed, saying he had not been given a call sheet for the day. No one had the basic courtesy to tell him where he was filming or which scenes he would be shooting. It was unforgivable!

Gently and with many apologies, the assistant director explained that Plummer hadn’t been called because this was his day off — he had no scenes that day.

Instead of backing down, the actor stormed back to his hotel and began drinking heavily, downing schnapps and beer chasers. It was left to the bar staff to talk him out of his foul mood.

If Julie Andrews detested him, no one could have blamed her. The supremely self-centred Plummer was incapable of seeing that, though: he assumed that, if she wasn’t speaking to him, it was because her admiration went too deep for words.

‘Julie was quite transparent,’ he decided. ‘There was no way she could conceal the simple truth . . . beneath my partly assumed sarcasm and indifference, she saw that I cared.

‘As two people who barely came to know each other throughout those long months of filming, we had somehow bonded. It was the beginning of a friendship — unspoken, but a friendship nonetheless.’

Last night, as news of Plummer’s death broke, Julie Andrews paid tribute to him, saying: ‘The world has lost a consummate actor and I have lost a cherished friend.

‘I treasure the memories of our work together and all the humour and fun we shared through the years.’

But at the time, the director, Robert Wise, opted to complete as much of the film as possible without Plummer, and he was given several weeks off.

He voiced regret for the foul behaviour of his earlier life, in particular for the way he treated first wife, Tammy: on the night she gave birth to his only child, Amanda, he left her alone to go drinking with friends. Pictured: Plummer as Commodus in the 1964 film The Fall of the Roman Empire

Rather than return to his wife in London, he explored Austria — visiting the opera, going to see the dancing Lipizzaner horses at the Spanish Riding School, touring the palaces.

At the Drei Husaren restaurant in Vienna, he insisted on ousting the resident musician and regaling the diners on the piano, while the professional pianist glared daggers at him. Then he announced he had sciatica and took to his hotel bed.

‘A local beauty of astonishing looks insisted on looking after me. She came regularly to my room. This sister of mercy made sure her nursing skills went far beyond the call of duty.

‘As I lay there, in heavenly bondage, at least one part of me was alive,’ he would later say.

When he returned to the set, he had put on so much weight that Wise ordered him to diet. At the time, Plummer was on his second marriage, to a former newspaper columnist named Pat Lewis.

She had interviewed him when he was at the Royal Shakespeare Company and, recently divorced from first wife Tammy, he embarked on a wild affair with the young journalist.

He was nominated again six years later for All The Money In The World (pictured), a role he took over from a disgraced Kevin Spacey, playing billionaire J. Paul Getty

Plummer and Lewis became regulars on the hip Soho scene, often hanging out in clubs such as The Establishment, run by Peter Cook.

Leaving the club in the small hours one wet night, their convertible Triumph Herald careered into a lamp post outside Buckingham Palace.

Lewis, who was driving, suffered a blood clot on the brain that left her in a coma, and with multiple fractures to her skull and face. Plummer somehow managed to walk away with only scratches.

As Lewis slowly began to recover, he bought a house in Mayfair where he could nurse her, and they were married in 1962.

But his drinking, which had threatened to overturn his career for years, became excessive. For weeks on end, he would drink himself unconscious.

In 1964, he recorded a maudlin interview for Canadian TV, playing the piano and expounding on the origins of his acting genius.

He was so visibly drunk that he spoke with difficulty: ‘Sadness gives birth to tragedy and comedy, sadness gives birth to talent,’ he said. ‘Most talent comes from sadness. All beauty is sad to me.’

Born Arthur Plummer in Toronto in 1929, he was the great-grandson of a Prime Minister and grew up in Quebec, speaking both French and English.

His parents introduced him to fine wine at 12, by which time he had already had his first sexual experiences with a nanny — who was sacked after she was discovered kissing him.

An early girlfriend told him that he thought of no one but himself.

‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘I find no other subject quite so worthy of my attention’ — a retort that he would recall proudly in his autobiography, 65 years later.

His self-confidence was extraordinary. When Laurence Olivier invited him to play the lead in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus at the National Theatre, Plummer retorted that he would tackle the role his own way and refused to let Olivier guide him.

‘Great actor, lousy director,’ he later sneered.

In another production at the National, he rounded on his co-stars on the first night and told them that they were all ‘a bunch of repertory a**eholes’. Away from the stage and the cameras, he could be even more unpleasant.

Film critic Victor Davis recalled how, at the launch of a Pink Panther film in 1974, the star lost his temper and began screaming at the journalist’s girlfriend — who had dared to speak to Plummer’s third wife, Elaine Taylor.

When Davis squared up to the actor and threatened to punch him on the nose, Plummer stalked away and sent his minder over to continue the argument.

By then, his career seemed to be on the skids, sabotaged by his own propensity for making enemies of the people who admired him most.

He made a series of films that promised more than they delivered — as Rommel in The Night Of The Generals in 1967 and the Duke of Wellington in 1970’s Waterloo.

He played Rudyard Kipling in The Man Who Would Be King in 1975, a film dominated by Michael Caine and Sean Connery, who were much bigger stars.

Gradually, Plummer drifted into blockbuster cameos, where his name would lend a little cachet to the hokum. In Star Trek VI, in 1991, he played a Klingon general called Chang — though he refused to wear the prosthetic make-up that would distend his skull.

But on stage, his talent still shone. In 1997, he won a Tony award for his portrayal of Hollywood great John Barrymore. One critic said the only flaw in the production was that Plummer was a far better actor than Barrymore could ever have dreamed of being.

Offers for really worthwhile films began to arrive again late in his career. In 2010, aged 81, he was nominated for his first Oscar, as Leo Tolstoy in The Last Station. Two years later, he won Best Supporting Actor for Beginners, a romantic comedy, making him the oldest ever winner of an Academy Award.

He was nominated again six years later for All The Money In The World, a role he took over from a disgraced Kevin Spacey, playing billionaire J. Paul Getty. He was also awarded the Companion of Honour in Canada. Plummer had finally mellowed enough to enjoy success — and enough for others to enjoy working with him.

He voiced regret for the foul behaviour of his earlier life, in particular for the way he treated first wife, Tammy: on the night she gave birth to his only child, Amanda, he left her alone to go drinking with friends.

By contrast, he was married to third wife, Elaine, for 50 years. And he even came to appreciate the role that made his name — as Captain von Trapp in The Sound Of Music.

‘What a terrific movie it is,’ he mused. ‘The very best of its genre — warm, touching, joyous and absolutely timeless.’ Watching it at a children’s party, he said: ‘I felt a sudden surge of pride that I’d been part of it.’

And the next day the 42-year-old - who wrestled under the ring name Tyler Reks - talked to Extra about her experience.

The star revealed that she has not been sexually active with her wife Priscilla after being married for almost 20 years.

Out and proud: Retired WWE wrestler Gabbi Tuft has come out as a transgender woman

And the icon - whose wife was by his side during the Extra interview - also shared what it was like to be intimate with Priscilla.

'It's been a very interesting … progression,' said Tuft after noting that Priscilla had a hard time with it.

'Our intimate life has changed quite a bit,' she added. 'We're not active in that way right now, and what we've discovered is a whole different part of our relationship.'

Tuft then shared: 'We actually don't have partners outside of the relationship at all. I was a virgin when we got married 18 and a half years ago — we had never kissed. Our first kiss was on our wedding day.'

And Tuft said it has not been smooth making the transition.

New life: The star revealed that she has not been sexually active with her wife Priscilla after being married for almost 20 years

Freed: 'She has been finally set free and ready to rule her world,' the press release explained

'There was a lot of very difficult, traumatic emotion in trying to figure out how I was going to present myself to the world,' she said. 'Having Priscilla by my side as a huge support has changed that. And she has been such a rock for me.'

They have also talked to daughter Mia, nine.

'It's an ongoing conversation,' she said. '… I told her, ""Sweetheart, I'm not going to go out in public right now and go outside,"" and she goes, ""Why, daddy?""

Tuft said, 'I'm afraid that people might make fun of me and it might affect you.'

Family: She touched on her role as a parent and a spouse in posts Tuesday and Wednesday, sharing photos with wife-of-18-years Priscilla and their daughter Mia, nine

Hard to do: 'There was a lot of very difficult, traumatic emotion in trying to figure out how I was going to present myself to the world,' she said. 'Having Priscilla by my side as a huge support has changed that. And she has been such a rock for me'

And then the child leaned over and gave Tuft 'the biggest hug.' The child added, 'Daddy, I will never make fun of you.'

'When I was 10 ... when my parents weren't home, I would sneak into my mom's closet and try out her clothes and it just felt right,' said the athlete.

Tuft 'suppressed' what she felt she felt she would not be accepted: 'So I pushed it down as far as I could.'

On Thursday her rep said: 'Gabbi is about to share her thrilling story of gender transitioning from a former WWE Superstar, Body Builder, Fitness Guru, Motivational Speaker and Motorcycle Racer to a fun loving and fabulous female. She has been finally set free and ready to rule her world.'

The release continued: 'Despite his successes during and after his WWE career, Gabe was still wrestling with a secret persona dwelling deep within him. This is a persona he has been hiding in the loud silence of his soul since childhood,' the release continues.

'Finally, with the blessing of his loving wife Priscilla, Gabe is ready to reveal who he really is. 'He' is now known as 'She': A beautiful, wise, witty and wonderful woman called 'Gabbi.'

'This is a story that wrestling and other sports fans, friends and followers must not miss, especially many in the LGBTQ community dealing with challenging transgender issues, who Gabbi and [wife] Priscilla are willing to help,' the release goes on.

Countdown: Gabbi teased the tell-all Extra interview while opening up on Instagram Thursday, sharing an extreme close-up of her face and writing: '**1 day remaining**'

It seems Gabbi had intended to reveal the news on Friday on Extra, but she took to Instagram to address the early revelation Thursday, sharing a photo of herself beaming and posing in front of an old wrestling photo as she shared her new, authentic look.

'The ball dropped early today as this is now worldwide news,' Tuft shared.

'This is me. Unashamed, unabashedly me. This is the side of me that has hidden in the shadows, afraid and fearful of what the world would think; afraid of what my family, friends, and followers would say or do.

'I am no longer afraid and I am no longer fearful. I can now say with confidence, that I love myself for WHO I am.

'The previous eight months have been some of the darkest of my entire life. The emotional turmoil of being transgender and having to face the world has almost ended me on multiple occasions.

'However, the day I stopped caring about what other people thought, was the day I truly became limitless and allowed my authentic self to come into the light.

'My loving wife, family, and closest friends have accepted me for who I am. To them, I am forever grateful. Your support along the way means more than you will ever know.

Another statement: Gabbi also shared a press release on her Instagram that explained more

'I don't expect everyone to agree or understand. It's not my place to change any of your core beliefs. Just know that the outer shell may change, but the soul remains the same,' said the San Francisco-born wrestling star.

'I know that many of you have questions and, as I have promised, they will all be answered. Tomorrow, on Extra, my interview with Billy Bush airs worldwide. I have included a link in the bio to this interview along with my personal coming out video that explains everything (waiting for Instagram to approve my name change and update the bio - please see my story for the link in the meantime).

'I promise to always be transparent and truthful with my journey, and to be a light to those that are in need.'

'This is me. Love always, Gabbi Alon Tuft,' she signed off.

Gabbi teased her reveal earlier in the day, sharing an extreme close-up of her face and writing: '**1 day remaining**'

''When you are ready to show all of your cards, there will be nothing left to fear.' Time's up,' she continued.

'I am no longer afraid. Fear has been replaced with the highest vibrational state of gratitude.

'I am grateful for my past, for who I started this life as, for who I was, for who I am now, and for who I am becoming.

'Tomorrow, I close this book of my life and begin a new one. My hope is that the last nine days of this countdown have helped you reflect on things not of material nature...but rather on the non-physical aspects of life that create what we call the human experience.

'I hope along the way you have felt emotions that you have forgotten, felt the power of your heart energy, and have searched your soul for truths untold.

'Tomorrow the ace drops. Tomorrow I start a new book of life,' she went on. 'Tomorrow, I invite you to share and celebrate this monumental moment with me.'

She touched on her role as a parent and a spouse in posts Tuesday and Wednesday, sharing photos with wife-of-18-years Priscilla and their daughter Mia, nine.

The influencer and wife of SNL star Alec Baldwin finally said 'sorry' for the saga and said she had 'spent the last month listening, reflecting, and asking myself how I can learn and grow'.

She stopped short of confessing she had misled people about her Spanish roots instead doubling down on her previous claims that she was raised 'with two cultures, American and Spanish' and that she feels 'a true sense of belonging to both'.

Hilaria had been laying low with her husband and their five children following the storm that erupted in December when she was exposed online over her fake heritage claims.

The 37-year-old was forced to confess she had been born in Boston and went by the name Hillary after she had spent years claiming Majorca was her birthplace and that she only arrived into the US at the age of 19.

In a caption alongside a photo of her with her husband Alec and their five children, she said: 'I've spent the last month listening, reflecting, and asking myself how I can learn and grow

Hilaria Baldwin apologized for faking her Spanish heritage in an Instagram post on Friday

In a caption alongside a photo of her with her husband Alec and their five children, she wrote in the Instagram post: 'I've spent the last month listening, reflecting, and asking myself how I can learn and grow.

'My parents raised my brother and me with two cultures, American and Spanish, and I feel a true sense of belonging to both.

'The way I've spoken about myself and my deep connection to two cultures could have been better explained - I should have been more clear and I'm sorry.

'I'm proud of the way I was raised, and we're raising our children to share the same love and respect for both.

'Being vulnerable and pushing ourselves to learn and grow is what we've built our community on, and I hope to get back to the supportive and kind environment we've built together,' she said.

At the end of December, it emerged that Hilaria - who in the past claimed to have grown up in Majorca and spoke with a Spanish accent - actually spent her childhood in Beacon Hill, Boston, and went by Hillary.

It started with a single tweet on December 21 which read: 'You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin's commitment to her decade long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person'.

The woman then continued to post videos and proof of how Hilaria's accent has changed over the years.

Several former classmates came forward to confirm that Hilaria was in fact raised in Weston, Massachusetts, by American parents without a hint of a foreign accent.

The 37-year-old was forced to confess she had been born in Boston after she spent years claiming Majorca was her birthplace and that she only arrived into the US at the age of 19

'I went to high school with her. Genuinely lovely person, I recall, but fully a white girl from Cambridge,' one wrote.

Another added: 'I went to high school with her. She was perfectly nice and serious about ballroom dancing. Her name was indeed Hillary Hayward-Thomas and she did not have her current accent.'

The woman who first exposed the fraud, later told The New York Times that it was an 'open secret' in Manhattan that Hilaria had faked her heritage, and that she and her friends, 'bored' from the pandemic, decided finally to expose the secret.

In the next few days several videos of Hilaria's past TV appearances resurfaced showing her commitment to a Spanish accent.

In one now infamous Today Show video that surfaced, Hilaria appeared to forget the English word for cucumber.

Hilaria had long described her mother as Spanish and, in a November 2012 interview, said her family couldn't understand how to pronounce her new surname Baldwin.

She said: 'I had to repeat it to my family three times: Baldddwinnn. And the third time they said Oh, we already know who it is! Why didn't you pronounce it right the first time?'

Hilaria claimed she was born in Majorca and didn't come to the US until she was 19 to attend New York University.

'I came for school and I never, ever left,' she said in an April 2020 interview.

A newly resurfaced tax form also revealed Hilaria took two attempts to get her name right as she toyed between her birth name and the adopted Spanish version.

The document shows she crossed out both the first name and last name of the 2009 W-4 document before finally decided on Hillary L. Hayward-Thomas - the name she was born with - on her second attempt.

But records surfaced revealing that Hilaria's parents, Dr Kathryn Hayward and David Thomas, were also both Massachusetts' natives and had lived and worked in the US for years only moving to Majorca in 2011 when they retired.

Hayward is not Spanish and is in fact a fourth-generation Massachusetts resident who spent most of her career practicing medicine in Longmeadow, records show.

Hayward gave birth to Hillary in January 1984 in Boston.

DailyMail.com revealed she grew up in this 100-year-old $4million house in the heart of the most desirable district in Boston called Beacon Hill

Hilaria's parents now own apartments in Inca in Majorca but only moved there in 2011

DailyMail.com discovered records showing Hilaria's parents bought a 100-year-old $4million house in the heart of the most desirable district in Boston called Beacon Hill when their daughter was just three years old.

They didn't move out till she had turned 28.

DailyMail.com also discovered the only property her parents currently own on the island of Majorca in their names are two apartments in the center of Inca which they purchased last summer.

Meanwhile, Baldwin's family 'friends' in Majorca told DailyMail.com they'd never met her, and that her parents spoke with American accents.

One restaurant owner where Hilaria's dad David Thomas and her mom own property, said 'to the best of my knowledge Hilaria's never been here.'

'Jeremy's [Hilaria's brother] parents understand Spanish and speak it but with a foreign accent and Jeremy is fairly fluent,' he said.

'But when they're together here, they speak to each other in English.'

A neighbor said she knew Hilaria's brother had gone to Majorca on a school exchange trip and that is when the family started to fall in love with the island.

Hilaria hit back over the scandal in a cringe-worthy New York Times interview in December where she pinned the blame for the deception on the media for 'misrepresenting me' which had caused people to be 'confused' about her heritage.

But the interview itself was full of contradictions from her previous accounts.

In an Instagram video in early January she tried to defend her actions again claiming she spent 'some of' her childhood in Spain and 'some' of it in Massachusetts

She claimed that she told husband Alec from their first meeting that she was from Boston'.

'I walked by him,' Hilaria told the Times of meeting Alec in a vegan restaurant in 2011.

'He said, ""Where are you from?"" And I said, ""I’m from Boston."" That was the first thing I said, that has always been my narrative.'

This contradicted Alec's now infamous 2013 Letterman interview in which he said 'my wife is from Spain.'

The couple also gave their five children Spanish names and incorporated several elements of Spanish culture into their wedding with readings in both Spanish and English, Hilaria waving a flamenco hand fan in pictures.

She put forgetting the word cucumber down to a 'brain fart' because she was nervous about being on live TV.

And she also blamed the bio on her agency's website - which said she was Spanish - on her reps, claiming they must have taken 'unverified information from the internet to write a sloppy bio.'

Hillary Thomas-Hayward officially became Hilaria Baldwin at her wedding to Alec, complete with tributes to her claimed Spanish roots, with the bride cooling herself with a flamenco hand fan and nuptial readings in both English and Spanish

'The things I have shared about myself are very clear,' she said. 'I was born in Boston. I spent time in Boston and in Spain. My family now lives in Spain. I moved to New York when I was 19 years old and I have lived here ever since.

'For me, I feel like I have spent 10 years sharing that story over and over again. And now it seems like it's not enough.'

She added that Spain 'was part of my father's childhood,' and that her family had 'created these deep, deep, deep bonds' with the country.

'Who is to say what you're allowed to absorb and not absorb growing up?' she said.

In an Instagram video in early January she tried to defend her actions again claiming she spent 'some of' her childhood in Spain and 'some' of it in Massachusetts.

'There was a lot of back and forth my entire life,' she said.

'And I'm really lucky that I grew up speaking two different languages and I'm trying to raise my kids, so they speak two languages too. And that's something very important to me especially having my family abroad.'

She said: 'Let's be very clear that Europe has a lot of white people in there and my family is white. Ethnically, I am a mix of many, many, many things. Culturally, I grew up with two cultures so it's really as simple as that.'

Hilaria added: 'Yeah I'm a different kind of Bostonian but that's who I am, and you kind of can't change your background - nor would I want to - I'm really, really proud of who I am.'

In her 2009 tax return, Hilaria first wrote her name as Hilaria, then as Hillary

She also said that '44 people from Spain' attended her 2012 wedding to Alec Baldwin.

'My whole family call me Hilaria. It always kind of bothered me that neither name sounds good in the other language. So I would use one or the other one,' she said.

Alec also defended his wife over the scandal telling a social media critic to 'Go f**k yourself' and posting a video where he slammed Twitter as 'a lot of s**t'.

Hilaria’s sister-in-law singer Chynna Phillips - who is married to Alec's brother William 'Billy' Baldwin - also defended her in a Page Six interview last month saying: 'She’s a good woman and none of us are perfect.'

The fall-out from the scandal resulted in major endorsement deals between Hilaria and two brands coming to an end.

Baby brand Cuties Baby Care and doll brand American Girl both revealed in January that they will no longer be working with Hilaria.

Cuties Baby Care confirmed she is no longer serving as a spokesperson after her six-month contract 'expired'.

'Hilaria's partnership with Cuties Baby Care was a six month contract that ran from July through December,' a spokesperson told DailyMail.com in January.

'The agreement expired at the end of December after all contractual obligations were filled.

'We thank Hilaria for the support she provided in 2020 and wish her, and her family, continued health and happiness in the New Year.”

Her deal with the company was first announced in July of last year.

The news comes days after Mattel toy company American Girl confirmed that it is also no longer working with Hilaria.

Alec Baldwin defended his wife in an Instagram video in December calling Twitter 'a lot of s**t'

It is not yet known whether the yoga teacher's other brand partners including Mattel toy label Fisher-Price, vacuum brand Bissell, and sparkling water company Spindrift. will attempt to distance themselves from her.

Her apology - six weeks on from when the scandal first broke - comes just days after Hollywood actor Salma Hayek also waded into the drama to say she had also been 'fooled' by Baldwin's claims but defended her saying 'we all lie a little bit.'

Hayek, who is good friends with Hilaria's husband Alec and does have Spanish roots, told SiriusXM's 'Andy Cohen Live' she felt 'honored' that the fitness instructor wanted to emulate someone of her background.

'We all lie a little bit. She makes my friend happy. She fooled me because she's such a good mother. She has five [kids] and you know, I don't care,' she said.

'It makes me feel proud that people are inspired. I think she's smart to want to be Spanish. We're cool, you know?'

Hayek admitted she found the situation 'bizarre' but insisted Baldwin is 'not a bad person'.",Hilaria Baldwin apologizes for faking her Spanish heritage

But the 28-year-old WAP rapper denied their claims and even shared video that appeared to show her rapping part of her song back in August 2020.

Early on Friday, Mir Pesos tweeted a clip of Cardi's Up video which was edited together with an excerpt from his low-budget Stuck video.

Pushing back: Cardi B, 28, denied accusations from rappers Mir Pesos and Mir Fontane that she had plagiarized their song Stuck with her new single Up on Friday; still from Up

The two song's appear to have somewhat similar minimalist beats, along with some nearly identical lines.

In Up, Cardi sings, 'If it’s up, then it’s up, then it’s up, then it’s stuck,' whereas Fontane raps, 'If it’s up then it’s stuck. Up then it’s stuck, yeah.'

In contrast to Cardi's candy-colored video, the Pesos and Fontaine video appeared to have been filmed in an apartment kitchen.

'We want my money,' Pesos added in his tweet while tagging Cardi and Fontaine.

As of Friday, Stuck has over 31,000 views on YouTube, whereas Cardi's Up video has 9.2 million views.

Call out: 'We want my money,' Pesos tweeted along with a video that juxtaposed Cardi's new song with their low-budget track

On Instagram, Pesos posted the two videos side by side, writing, 'Mannn somebody tagg they them ppl tell to get with my ppl.

He added: 'They stealing.'

But Cardi attempted to clear her name by sharing a video which she claimed dated back to August 7.

'From AUGUST 7TH now check when the other n**** posted his song. I BEEN WORKING ON THIS. Sorry lil boy never Hurd of you,' she captioned the clip.

The video appears to show Cardi repeatedly shouting, 'Up and it's stuck!'

August 7 marked the release of her monster hit WAP with Megan Thee Stallion, who was also featured in the split-screen clip.

Pointing fingers: On Instagram, Pesos posted the two videos side by side, writing, 'Mannn somebody tagg they them ppl tell to get with my ppl. He added: 'They stealing'

Receipts: But Cardi shared a clip of her and Megan Thee Stallino that was allegedly from August 7 in which she appears to shout a line from Up over and over

Pesos and Fontane's song Stuck wasn't released until September, but Fontane claimed the rappers had shared a preview of the song on YouTube on August 6, according to Page Six.

Representatives for the Bodak Yellow rapper have yet to comment, but she appeared to reference the allegations during an Instagram Live session.

'I am the type of person, I don’t like going to court…' she began

'If I jack something from somebody,' she would pay up, she continued

Later, she seemed to urge Fontane and Pesos to make their complaints official.

'If you’re feeling a certain type of way, we can take it to court. I don’t give a f**k… Get the f**k out of here,' she said dismissively.

As for the possibility that the songs had similar beats, Cardi clarified that she's not a producer, or the person who usually creates the music for hip hop songs.

Fighting words: 'If you’re feeling a certain type of way, we can take it to court. I don’t give a f**k… Get the f**k out of here,' Cardi threatened on Instagram Live on Friday

Cardi recently said on YouTube that she 'wanted a more hood song,' adding: 'I thought that my last song was more sexy… I wanted to do something more gangster, more cocky.'

In a new interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, the star admitted that she was feeling 'nervous' about releasing the music video, which has already sparked a buzz among her fans and detractors.

She said: 'I'm good, but I'm very nervous. Oh my gosh. This week has been a really... Not a bad week, but a bad week for my nerves. I've been waking up early. I haven't been able to eat, I've been like...Well, I don't know.

'I feel like I get criticized a lot, and scrutinized, so it's just like everything... Everything. I always feel like I've got to be super, super, super perfect. I'm a Libra, so everybody's opinion always counts to me.'

Speaking about how she approaches releasing new music, she explained: 'My last song was very sexual, very sexual, so I always want my next songs to be different than the one before.

'If a topic on one of my songs is money, the other topic, I want it to be about something else. When I started rapping, when I first put music out, like my mixtape, it was all... This might sound crazy, but I got really inspired by Drill Chicago music.

'I was young, and I liked that and everything, so my mixtape was very all about gangster violence. If it's up, then it's stuck. That's where I wanted to take it with this record.'

Stay gold: She finished the look with the appropriate scrunchy 'do, gold hoop earrings, matching bangles and some pumped kicks

On the public's reaction to WAP, which dominated the airwaves last summer, she said: 'I was just really surprised. I was just so surprised, because everybody was raging. Like, ""Oh my god. This song is so freaky and nasty.""

'Even when I hear it, I'd be like, ""This song, to me, is not as nasty and freaky,"" because I grew up listening to freaky-ass rappers. I grew up with Lil' Kim, Trina... Khia, Foxy, everybody. I feel like this is really mild, but I don't know.

'Nowadays, people just want to rave about everything. I feel because people have been wanting me and Megan to collab, so when a record like that was too freaky... I guess they wasn't really expecting that, or something.'

However, the song also garnered much criticism, particularly from prominent Republicans on US cable networks.

Addressing, the backlash, she said: 'I mean, because nowadays, people are just more open about their sexuality and everything. When WAP came out, the people that was criticizing it the most, they were like, ""This is so nasty. This is so freaky.

Sapphic sirens: The slumber party quickly turned into a different kind of gathering, as heavy petting was followed by a steamy make-out session

'I don't even think it was like, I don't know, religious people. It was really a lot of Republicans. Like, big Republicans. Not like senators... Like that. It was literally like those motherf***ers that got blue checks on Twitter.

'They are big influencers. It's just like, ""Out of anything that y'all could have talked about..."" Since, like I said, I was endorsing. I used to endorse Bernie [Sanders], and then Joe Biden.

'They was just trying to figure a way out to pick on me. Like, ""Oh, Joe Biden, is this the girl you were doing an interview with? The girl that's talking about WAP? That's what you want America to be influenced by?""

'It's like, ""Bro, come on, now."" It was just a lot. I couldn't believe it. When I saw that, when I saw Fox News talking so bad about WAP, I was like, ""Are you serious? Really?”'

Having to spend time in lockdown alongside much of the rest of the world, Cardi B admitted that she struggled to write songs of substance while shut away from the outside world for an extended period of time.

She said: 'I feel like I need a couple of more songs. I need... I don't know. I need, like, eight more songs, and I need more things to happen. I just need more things to happen.

'It's like after I drop this record and I see what's going on, I'm going to put it in my music, too. I don't know. It's hard, right now, also, to do music when nothing is happening. We're not doing nothing. What can I rap about?

'You're not really doing s**t. And I'm not a person that likes to talk about my sensitive feelings. I don't like to always rap about when I'm super sad and everything. It's really hard to express certain feelings that I've got inside of me.

'It's really hard for me to express that. When it comes to love, and when it comes to emotions, when it comes to things that I have to deal with, it's really hard for me to even talk about it to certain people, so it's really hard to put it in the music and everything, but it's just... I don't know. I always debate myself. ""Do I really want people to know everything that I be feeling?”'

In early May 2020, DailyMail.com reported that the 37-year-old reality star checked into All Points North Lodge in Edwards, Colorado to work on 'past traumas,' and sought treatment for cocaine and alcohol abuse.

However, Disick left just a week later, when pictures of him were leaked online alongside audio recordings of his conversations with his therapist.

Resolution: Scott Disick has reached an 'amicable resolution' with the Colorado-based rehab center he accused of leaking the news of his stay last spring; seen here in April 2019

At the time, Scott sought legal action against the treatment facility, with his lawyer stating that he was 'alarmed by the extreme invasion of privacy.'

But on Friday, All Points North Lodge announced it had 'amicably resolved its disagreements' with Scott.

And in a subsequent statement, the television personality himself said he no longer believes the staff of the center were to blame for the publicity leak.

'Behavioral health in this country still carries a stigma. That stigma is often the greatest barrier for people who want help,' Scott said in his statement.

Seen here in LA in April 2020: DailyMail.com reported last May that the star checked into All Points North Lodge in Edwards, Colorado to seek treatment for cocaine and alcohol abuse

However: Disick left just a week later, when pictures of him at the APN center were leaked online alongside audio recordings of his conversations with his therapist

'Both APN Lodge and I believe that everyone seeking help deserves that help free of disclosure or publicity.

'To that end, l have resolved all of my issues with APN Lodge and after an investigation do not believe that the facility was responsible for the leak of my personal information,' the Talentless founder added. 'I hope this experience encourages, rather than discourages, others from seeking the help they need.'

Scott’s ordeal was previously addressed in an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, when his ex-partner Kourtney Kardashian – with whom he shares children Mason, 11, Penelope, eight, and Reign, six – said he had 'never felt more betrayed in his life' following the leak.

In the clip, Kourtney’s sister Kim Kardashian West said: 'I heard that Scott went to rehab by seeing it online. And it looks like someone at the facility leaked a photo of him. And I feel really bad for him.'

To which Kourtney revealed: 'They leaked his actual conversations, like, with the therapist.

'He's only been just him and the therapist. He said he's never been more betrayed in his life. And he is packing and he's definitely coming home but he's really upset, especially [because] he was going to work on himself and like, his traumas.'

And in a confessional, 41-year-old Kourtney slammed those responsible for the leak.

She said: 'I feel like whoever did leak this information should be really ashamed of themselves. Everyone deserves to deal with their past traumas in privacy. He was completely violated.'

At the time, sources said Disick – known for his previous hard partying and multiple stints in rehab – had been drinking heavily and taking cocaine after the onset of the coronavirus lockdown.

It's understood the star had struggled with family life during lockdown and was still having a hard time coping with the loss of both his parents within a two-year period from 2013 to 2014.

Ciulla recently severed ties with the 52-year-old shock rocker in the wake of allegations from multiple women that he sexually and physically abused them, Rolling Stone reported on Friday.

The actress Evan Rachel Wood, 33, the most prominent of the women, claimed Manson was her abuser after having spoken about the figure anonymously in 2019 while advocating for legislation to extend the statute of limitations for domestic violence.

Severed ties: Marilyn Manson's manager Tony Ciulla has dropped the rocker as a client after working with him for more than two decades, Rolling Stone reported on Friday; seen at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in February 2020

Ciulla's 25-year collaboration with Manson (real name: Brian Warner) began in 1996 with the release of his breaththrough sophomore album Antichrist Superstar.

The LP, which blended industrial music with hard-edged metal, earned positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success after reaching number three on the Billboard 200 chart.

Ciulla was seemingly immune to past legal threats to Manson, including lawsuits launched by his former bandmates.

The musician was swept up in controversy following the 1999 Columbine High School shooting after the gunmen Eric Harris and Dyland Klebold were reported to have been fans of Manson's music.

The reports were false, but religious institutions and social conservatives escalated their campaigns against his music in the wake of the school shooting.

Ciulla, who hasn't commented on the abuse allegations against his client, dropped Manson after Woods publicly named him on social media earlier this week, a source said.

'The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,' the Kajillionaire star wrote on Instagram on Monday.

'He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,' she continued.

'I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.'

Four other women joined Wood with their own statements about Manson's alleged abuse on Monday, and other women have subsequently accused him of abuse.

The rocker's most recent record label, Loma Vista, also dropped him earlier this week.

Instigating incident: Ciulla, who hasn't commented on the abuse allegations, dropped Manson after his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood accused him of sexual abuse on Monday; Wood and Manson seen in 2007 in Cologne, Germany

Setting the record straight: Wood previously mentioned an unnamed abuser during her 2018 testimony in front of a House Judiciary Subcommittee, and she later clarified that it was Manson

Wood previously mentioned an unnamed abuser during her 2018 testimony in front of a House Judiciary Subcommittee while trying to get the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights passed across the nation.

'My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gaslighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body,' she said.

Manson posted a denial to Instagram shortly after Wood shared her statement.

'Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,' he wrote.

'My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.'

Pushing back: 'My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,' he continued

In a 2009 interview with Spin, Manson said of Wood: 'I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.'

However, a representative for the rocker downplayed the comment in 2020 to Louder, claiming that it was 'obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account.'

In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that a police report had been filed against Manson over sex crimes that allegedly took place in 2011.

However, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office opted not to pursue the charges later that summer due to a lack of evidence.

'The allegations made to the police were and are categorically denied by Mr. Warner and are either completely delusional or part of a calculated attempt to generate publicity for the claimant’s business of selling Manson memorabilia,' said Manson's attorney Howard E. King at the time.

'The police report that spurred the investigation was accompanied by the woman’s press release and other attempts to generate publicity that fraudulently claimed she was held captive by Mr. Warner for 48 hours in 2011. Any claim of sexual impropriety or imprisonment at that, or any other, time is false.'",Marilyn Manson DROPPED by longtime manager after sexual abuse allegations from Evan Rachel Wood

Marc McWilliams, a one-time rapper turned security guard for the famous clan, filed a $3million lawsuit against Jenner last year claiming she grabbed his butt, exposed herself to him, and had him fired when he rebuffed her advances.

In an amended complaint filed at Los Angeles Superior Court this week McWilliams added to his allegations, claiming Jenner sexually assaulted him while they were out driving in her luxury Bentley almost four years ago.

In a statement to DailyMail.com Friday, attorney Michael Rhodes said Jenner 'categorically rejects these new baseless claims', adding that she is yet to be served with the legal action.

McWilliams, 44, who worked for the family in 2017 and 2018, in court papers described a 'particularly shocking' incident the morning of October 22, 2017 when Jenner wanted to go out in her car and ordered him to sit in the front passenger seat.

As Jenner drove, 'She began making comments to plaintiff [McWilliams] of a flirtatious and overtly sexual nature,' his attorney Sean Novak said in the filing obtained by DailyMail.com.

Marc McWilliams (right) has accused former boss Kris Jenner of sexual assault in a new court filing that comes months after he sued the Kardashian matriarch for sexual harassment, racial discrimination and other 'outrageous' and 'despicable' acts

McWilliams, who worked as a bodyguard for the Kardashian clan between 2017 and 2018, claims Jenner once groped him and made suggestive comments when they were out in her Bentley (pictured in 2014) in October 2017

Jenner, 65, has been dating Corey Gamble (pictured together in February 2020) since 2014

'Without warning, Jenner placed her right hand on the inside upper left thigh and groin area of McWilliams in a manner that was overtly sexually offensive.

'She then caused her right hand to move up the upper, inner left thigh and groin, while caressing McWilliams.'

The complaint claims McWilliams was 'shocked and offended' by Jenner's sexual advances and attempted to shift away from her.

But as he moved his body away, he claims, Jenner's right hand came into contact with his 'inner groin and genital area.'

McWilliams was 'shocked, offended and emotionally distressed' by Jenner's 'outrageous and uninvited' actions, which 'at no time did he consent to,' the complaint states.

As a result of Jenner's behavior, McWilliams suffered 'physical and mental pain….illness….loss of sleep, depression' and other health issues,' Novak wrote.

The filing comes five months after McWilliams first sued his former boss for harassment, racial discrimination and other 'outrageous' and 'despicable' acts.

His original complaint claimed Kris was 'repeatedly and frequently causing her body to come into intimate physical contact' with his body.

Kim's 41 year-old sister Kourtney Kardashian is also named in the lawsuit but it's her mother who subjected McWilliams to a 'pattern of unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances and otherwise harassing misconduct,' court documents claim.

The 44-year-old described feeling 'shocked and offended' by Jenner's alleged actions. He previously said Jenner was 'repeatedly and frequently causing her body to come into intimate physical contact' with his body

In an amended complaint filed at Los Angeles Superior Court this week, McWilliams added to his original allegations, claiming Jenner sexually assaulted him while they were out in her luxury Bentley

But according to Rhodes, 'This lawsuit, filed back in September, has yet to be served on Ms. Jenner and involves events alleged to have occurred more than two years ago. The allegations are not only wrong and scandalous, but seem designed to coerce Ms. Jenner into silence via a settlement. This will not happen.'

'Rather, Ms. Jenner fully intends to seek vindication at trial, armed with evidence that will show the falsity of the claims being made. Following that, Ms. Jenner will pursue all of her available legal remedies to protect her good name and reputation and to hold those who brought this suit accountable.'

Among Jenner's 'inappropriate' and 'sexually suggestive' behavior, McWilliams listed:

Daughter Kourtney Kardashian is also named in the lawsuit brought on last year. Neither Kris nor Kourtney - or McWilliams - showed up Wednesday for a hearing at LA Superior Court

'Massaging (his) neck, shoulders, arms and back without his consent;

'Causing her hand to rest on (his) thigh and groin;

'Causing her pelvis to rub against (his)back ad/or rear end without his consent or approval;

'Causing her hands to come into contact with (his) rear end without his consent nor approval;

'Exposing portions of her body to (him) in a lewd or suggestive manner'

McWilliams - who is seeking a jury trial - told Jenner that her behavior was unwelcome and asked her to stop, he said in court documents.

'But Jenner ignored all such requests and persisted with this inappropriate misconduct.'

McWilliams - who is African American - is also alleging racial discrimination, including, 'pervasive and cruel mockery, harassment, belittling, and otherwise humiliating mistreatment by defendants due to (his) race.'

He claims he complained to his security company employer's human resources department, but he contended, he was again ignored.

He was suspended from working with Kris, but continued working for Kourtney, till he was fired on September 12, 2018, said McWilliams - whose lawsuit also alleges wrongful termination against his employers, David Shield Security and Armor Protection Services.

McWilliams claimed that after his firing, he endured 'harassment, intimidation and otherwise threatening misconduct in an effort to dissuade or prevent (him) from bringing any form of action against defendants for their unlawful misconduct.'

After McWilliams filed his lawsuit last September, Jenner's attorney, Marty Singer, denied the claims in a statement to DailyMail.com: 'Kris Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian vehemently deny the completely false claims made by former security guard Marc.

'His absurd allegations are clearly fabricated and are contrary to easily confirmed facts. Kris never acted inappropriately toward him.

'The security company stopped assigning McWilliams to work there after the guard was repeatedly caught sleeping in his car on the job.

'Significantly, McWilliams never made any complaints to his employer about Kris until contriving this ludicrous claim a year later.

'Although Kourtney is named in the suit, she is not accused of doing anything improper, nor did she do so.

'When Kris and Kourtney defeat this frivolous lawsuit, they intend to immediately sue McWilliams and his attorneys for malicious prosecution.'

The Kardashian-Jenner clan in September announced Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which capulted the family into the spotlight, was ending its 13-year run

McWilliams is a founding member of the late 80s group MGM - Musically Gifted Men - which he started with his close friend, disgraced rap star R. Kelly.

After 20 seasons on the TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the series which catapulted the family into the spotlight after its debut in 2007, is ending this month.

Kris' first taste of fame came during her first marriage to LA lawyer Robert Kardashian when he was one of the 'dream team' of top attorneys who won an acquittal for O.J. Simpson at the end of his notorious murder trial in the mid 90s.

She and Robert had four children, daughters Kourtney, Kim, now 40, Khloe, 36, and son Rob, 33. They divorced in 1991 and Robert died of cancer in 2003.

In April 1991 - only a month after her divorce from Kardashian - Kris married her second husband, ex Olympic gold medal winning athlete, Bruce Jenner and they had two children, Kendall, 25 and Kylie, 23.

The couple split up in 2013 and divorced in 2015, the same year Bruce publicly declared himself as a transgender woman, who now goes by Caitlyn Jenner.",Former Kardashian security guard sues Kris Jenner for sexual assault in amended complaint

WHAT IS A STILLBIRTH? A stillbirth occurs when a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby dies before 24 weeks of pregnancy, it is known as a miscarriage. Not all stillbirths can be prevented, however, not smoking or drinking, as well as not sleeping on your back and attending all antenatal appointments can reduce the risk. What are the signs? Signs may include the baby not moving as much as normal. Pregnant women should contact their doctor immediately if they notice a difference to their baby's movement. What are the causes? Stillbirths do not always have an obvious cause but may occur due to complications with the placenta or a birth defect. They are also more likely to occur if women suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or an infection that affects the baby, such as flu. Stillbirths are more likely to occur if women are having twins or multiple pregnancies, are overweight, smoke, are over 35 or have a pre-existing condition, such as epilepsy. What happens after a stillbirth? If a baby has died, women may wait for their labour to start naturally or they may be induced if their health is at risk. Bereavement support groups are available to parents who have suffered stillbirths. Some find it helpful to name their baby or take pictures with them. Source: NHS Choices Advertisement

In their original post, Chrissy wrote on Instagram: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before...

'We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough.

'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.

'To our Jack - I’m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn’t give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you.'

I've also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others. Which brings me to your blatant attempt at free media attention to distract from your dismal record as a union. Your organization has done little for its members, and nothing for me—besides collecting dues and promoting dangerous un-American policies and ideas—as evident by your massive unemployment rates and lawsuits from celebrated actors, who even recorded a video asking, ‘Why isn’t the union fighting for me?’"" These, however, are policy failures. Your disciplinary failures are even more egregious. I no longer wish to be associated with your union. As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from SAG-AFTRA. You have done nothing for me. Regards, President Donald J. Trump Advertisement

It costs $3,000 to join with an annual base fee of $222.96 and work dues.

In a statement last month its president Carteris said: 'Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred – democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press.

'There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.'

SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director David White added: 'Our most important role as a union is the protection of our members. The unfortunate truth is, this individual's words and actions over the past four years have presented actual harm to our broadcast journalist members.

'The board's resolution addresses this effort to undermine freedom of the press and reaffirms the principles on which our democratic society rests, and which we must all work to protect and preserve.'

Sodsai Predpring Dalzell was released from Los Angeles County jail on Friday morning, the LA County District Attorney's Office has confirmed to DailyMail.com.

Several media outlets reported that the charges against Dalzell had been dismissed, but the DA's Office told DailyMail.com that the case was re-filed and that the charges stand.

'The case was dismissed because the defendant didn't waive her 60-day right to trial,' a spokesperson for the DA's Office told DailyMail.com.

'Our office filed the case today with the same charges.

'As [to] whether she will be re-arrested, I don't have any details at this time.'

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told DailyMail.com on Friday that the investigation is ongoing.

Sodsai Predpring Dalzell, 39, was released from Los Angeles County jail on Friday morning, the LA County District Attorney's Office has confirmed to DailyMail.com

Dalzell was arrested by police in Malibu this past September for trying to kidnap Joe Montana's granddaughter from NFL legend's home as she slept in playpen. After a brief struggle, Jennifer Montana, Joe's wife, pried the girl away, and Dalzell fled from the home. She was later arrested nearby. No one was hurt. Joe is seen right with Jennifer in San Francisco in February 2016

Video footage shows the moment Dalzell was arrested on September 26 after Montana called the police

'A judge authorizes the release of any inmate. We only follow the orders of the DA's office,' an LASD spokesperson told DailyMail.com.

'If the case was dismissed she was probably released. However we do not have any other information at this time.'

DailyMail.com has contected Dalzell's attorney Ayinde Jones for comment.

She pleaded not guilty in LA County court to felony counts of attempted kidnapping of a child under 14 and burglary.

'Miss Dalzell is extremely apologetic and is very well concerned about the well-being of the family,' Dalzell's attorney Ayinde Jones said.

'She understands the harm that this has caused the family, friends and also fans of the Montana family.

Montana, nicknamed 'Joe Cool,' played 13 years of his 15 year-career with the 49ers, who won four Super Bowls with him as starting quarterback

'So our heart goes out to them.'

DailyMail.com has also reached out to Montana for comment.

If convicted, Dalzell faces a maximum prison sentence of up to eight years.

At the time of her arrest, bail was set at $200,000. It is unclear if she was freed on bail.

A spokesperson for the DA's Office declined to offer information about the terms and conditions of her bail.

Montana, 64, told sheriff's deputies that the nine-month-old baby girl was asleep in a playpen in his house in Malibu, California, on September 26 when a woman he did not know entered and picked up the child.

The woman broke into the 49ers legend's home in the 22100 block of Pacific Coast Highway and snatched the sleeping baby.

Montana and his wife, Jennifer, confronted her, tried to de-escalate the situation and asked her to give back the baby, authorities said.

After a brief struggle, Jennifer Montana pried the girl away, and Dalzell fled from the home, authorities said. She was later arrested nearby. No one was hurt.

Detectives said Dalzell was unknown to the Montana family prior to the attempted kidnapping but did not speculate on her motive.

'Scary situation, but thankful that everybody is doing well,' the former San Francisco 49ers star tweeted the day after the incident.

Sheriff squad cars were patrolling near the Montanas' home, in a neighborhood known as 'Billionaire's Row', when they were flagged down by Joe after the attempted kidnapping.

Dalzell was arrested a short time later, as seen in the video obtained by KCAL.

Witnesses said the suspect did not put up a fight while being handcuffed.

Montana, nicknamed 'Joe Cool,' played 13 years of his 15 year-career with the 49ers, who won four Super Bowls with him as starting quarterback.

He retired in 1994 after two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Joe and Jennifer tied the knot in 1985 and have four children together: Alexandra Whitney, 34, Elizabeth Jean, 33, Nathaniel 'Nate' Joseph, 30, and Nicholas 'Nick' Alexander, 28.

The Duke of Sussex, 36, appeared at the start of a film online to pay tribute to the sport in footage shot in his Montecito mansion.

In the now familiar pose sat on his sofa in front of three nest paintings, the be-suited Royal spoke of the ""passion and enjoyment"" of sport.

He said: 'Rugby union has brought joy to millions of people with teams full of great characters and special players.

'In these... isolated times, the sheer passion and enjoyment that sport offers can bring great comfort to many.

The film comes just two days after it was claimed he was keen to retain his honorary military titles and spend more time in Britain.

A friend claimed ahead of the one-year review of 'Megxit' he wanted to keep the three patronages which he had to give up after stepping down as a senior royal last March and moving to the US.

The titles held by the 36-year-old were Captain General of the Royal Marines; Honorary Air Commandant of RAF Honington in Bury St Edmunds; and Commodore-in-Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command.

Harry's friend, who has not been named, told the Daily Telegraph: 'His military work is one of the most important things to him. Of course he wants to keep them.'

The Duke is said to believe that he should retain the patronages, given that he spent ten years in the Army and has continuing links with the Invictus Games Foundation.

But it is understood that Harry, who married Meghan Markle in May 2018, may have to give up the titles because he does not plan to return to royal duties.

The friend added that he had always intended to regularly travel between the US and UK after moving to California, and only the pandemic has forced him to stay there.",Prince Harry decries 'these isolated times' as he speaks of the 'passion and enjoyment' of sport

The pair were first linked last May, after things turned romantic when they collaborated on the track All The Things You're Searching for on his album.

Benson on the other hand had just gotten out of a long term relationship with model Cara Delevingne, making many believe she was just playing the field.

By June he had attended her sisters wedding as her date, and by October they had gone Instagram official and he had begun to talk about Ashley and their relationship publicly, calling her 'a special one.'

Brady, 43, did not take the bait. Instead he mimed zipping his lips and said 'I have no comment for that.'

'Tom Brady seems like the kind of man who doesn't know how to use a wrench,' read another tweet.

Brady conceded: 'It's kinda true.'

'Hi, I'm Tom Brady and I'm a crybaby and I have a butthole in my chin.'

'Can we be real for a moment?' said Brady, reading another tweet. 'Is there really anyone you'd rather see dropped in vat of rendered bacon fat than Tom Brady?'

Brady, matching wits with his detractor, responded: 'you suck.'

He also showed some vulnerability in the face of the online hate.

When one person wrote 'f*** you Tom Brady you fat b**** I hope you cry,' he quickly admitted, 'I do cry, too.'

'Tom Brady really is a good QB but he will forever be known as a d***less b****,' Brady said, reading the penultimate tweet.

Brady did ultimately get offended, but not until the final contributor Tweeted: 'F*** you Tom Brady I hope your dog eats chocolate and gets really sick and throws up on your socks.'

Astonished, Brady snapped: 'That's f***ed up.'

'That's Tom's line, and you crossed it,' laughed Kimmel, who managed to turn a handful of tweets from unpaid writers into a two-minute segment.

Everest.

Higher Ground Productions, which the former first couple founded in 2018 partnership with Netflix, revealed that it is currently working on varied line-up of four new films and two more TV series.

Among them are a docuseries about national parks, a science-fiction movie, and a TV show based on a young adult thriller about a Native American teen who goes undercover.

Coming! Higher Ground Productions, which President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama formed in partnership with Netflix, announced a new lineup today

'We created Higher Ground to tell great stories,' the Obamas said in a press release. 'This group of projects builds upon that goal and the incredible path forged by films like ""Crip Camp,"" ""Becoming,"" and the Oscar-winning ""American Factory.""'

'From science fiction to the beauty of our natural world to the relationships that define us, Higher Ground continues to strive for fresh perspectives, compelling characters, and a healthy dose of inspiration,' the couple continued.

'We couldn’t be more proud to team up with the brilliant artists behind each of these stories. Each of them has something important to say.'

The Obamas did not have a wealth of production experience before inking a deal with Netflix in May 2018, howeverm they enlisted several industry professionals to bring that insight to Higher Ground.

Producer Priya Swaminathan and director and producer Tonia Davis were named as co-heads of the production company in February 2019.

Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, of Netflix, added of the Obamas' upcoming projects: '""American Factory,"" ""Crip Camp,"" and ""Becoming"" have captivated audiences all around the world, and their new slate highlights the variety and depth of programming on the horizon as well as new and exciting storytellers.'

It has never been disclosed how much the Obamas were paid as part of the Netflix deal, however, major producers like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy have received upwards of $100 million in their own respective partnerships with the streaming site.

The Obamas signed a joint $65million book deal with Penguin Random House in March 2018 for their respective memoirs, with Michelle releasing hers — Becoming — in November of that year, while Barack's — A Promised Land — was published in November 2020.

Below, see the new movies and TV shows the Obamas are bringing to Netflix in the next few years.

Pictured: Tenzing Norgay pictured on the Summit of Mount Everest in 1953

Tenzing

'Tenzing' is a movie inspired by the true story of Tenzing Norgay, Tibetan mountaineer who reached the top of Mount Everest in 1953.

Along with Sir Edmund Hillary, who he climbed with, Tenzing was the first person to summit the mountain, which is the world's highest peak at 29,035 feet.

Tenzing lived in the Khumbu region of Nepal, near Everest and became a sherpa, embarking on his first expedition as a porter in 1935.

He went on several more expeditions before ascending with Hillary, and is considered a hero to many Nepalese and Indians.

He was awarded Britain’s George Medal and the Star of Nepal. In addition to collaborating on his own autobiography, he is also the subject of the book 'Everest' (1978) and 'Tenzing: Hero of Everest' (2003).

It is that latter book, by Ed Douglas, that Netflix's new movie is based on.

The script was written by Oscar nominee and BAFTA winner Luke Davies, and it will be directed by BAFTA nominee Jennifer Peedom — who has climbed Everest herself.

Satellite

There's also 'Satellite,' a science fiction film written by Ola Shokunbi and produced by Kiri Hart and Stephen Feder for Rian Johnson and Ram Bergman's T Street.

This is a big project for Ola Shokunbi, who previously wrote Sadé, a live-action fairytale about an African Princess.

Kiri Hart produced Star Wars Rebels and co-produced 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' and 'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi; while Stephen Feder's credits include 'Money From Strangers,' 'Let's Big Happy,' and 'Sports Action Team.'

The Young Wife

This movie will be written and directed by Tayarisha Poe.

It 'follows Celestina, 29, on the day of her first wedding. Or not a wedding, exactly, but a party. A party where there’s movement, and Celestina is out of sync. The guests flood in; a storm approaches.'

Tayarisha's debut film, 'Selah and The Spades,' premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2019 and was released in April 2020 by Amazon Studios.

A rising star in the film industry, she was one of Filmmaker Magazine's 25 New Faces in 2015, winner of the Sundance Institute’s Knight Foundation Fellowship in 2016, a 2017 Pew Fellow, and one of Variety’s 10 Directors to Watch in 2019.

Exit West

Read up! The upcoming film 'Exit West' is based on a novel of the same name by Mohsin Hamid (left), while a series called 'Firekeeper's Daughter' is based on a YA novel by Angeline Boulley

A rather timely film on the docket is 'Exit West,' based on a novel of the same name by Mohsin Hamid — which President Obama named as one of the best books he read in 2017.

It was also selected for the Booker Prize longlist and named one of the New York Times' 10 Best Books of 2017 .

'A love story set against an epic global migration enabled by a supernatural phenomenon, ""Exit West"" is the story of two people as they seek a better life together, all the while yearning for a home to which they may never return,' reads the description.

The novel is about Nadia and Saeed, who fall in love while chaos and violence spread in their country. Together, they flee west as refugees.

Great National Parks

As for TV series, viewers can expect a natural history show called 'Great National Parks,' which will 'explore some of the most wondrous national parks and wild spaces on Earth.'

'Highlighting extraordinary species and habitats, the series will illustrate the importance of protecting the world's remaining wildernesses and making them accessible for all,' reads the description.

The series is being produced in conjunction with Wild Space Productions and wildlife filmmaker James Honeyborne of the award-winning series BluePlanet II.

It's no surprise that President Obama would be involved with a national parks project, as he made a mark on the national park system during his two terms in the White House.

According to the BBC, he protected more natural habitat than any president in American history.

He put 548 million acres of habitat under protection, compared to the 290 million acres by President Theodore Roosevelt, who founded the US National Parks.

His legacy includes the two largest marine reserves in the world and the world's second largest desert reserve.

A series called 'Firekeeper's Daughter' is based on a YA novel by Angeline Boulley

Firekeeper's Daughter

The Obamas really got ahead of the game 'Firekeeper's Daughter,' which is based on a YA novel by Angeline Boulley that hasn't even come out yet. (It's expected to be published this spring).

'Firekeeper's Daughter' is about an 18-year-old Native American teen named Daunis Fontaine, who lives on the Ojibwe reservation.

Afer Daunis witnesses a murder, she ends up being recruited to go undercover with the FBI to investigate a new drug.

Both author Boulley and series co-writer Wenonah Wilms are from the Ojibwe tribe.

Mickey Fisher, who created the shows Reverie and Extant, will serve as showrunner.

Past projects: President Obama is pictured with Andraéa LaVant, a disability advocate and consultant on the documentary Crip Camp

The announcement comes just two-and-a-half months after the production company revealed it was working on two other projects.

One is the comedy series 'The G Word with Adam Conover,' which is loosely inspired by Michael Lewis' bestselling book 'The Fifth Risk.'

Barack and Michelle acquired the rights to Lewis' book back in 2018

The Obamas acquired the rights to Lewis' book in 2018. Lewis is also the best-selling author of The Big Short and Moneyball, which have both become revered movies.

'The Fifth Risk' explores the political appointments of the Trump presidency and the effects they had on various departments.

The series will also offer documentary elements as viewers learn more about the civil servants who work behind the scenes in government.

It was created by Fair Point and will be run by Conover, along with Jon Cohen and Jon Wolf.

Also in November's announcement was an upcoming preschool animated series called 'Ada Twist, Scientist.'

They will both join the three projects that Higher Ground Productions have already produced, including the documentary capturing Michelle's book tour for 'Becoming'.

Another, 'Crip Camp' — a documentary about a summer camp for teens with disabilities — has already won the 2021 International Documentary Association award for Best Feature.

To him, it was The Sound Of Mucus, or S&M — a sly reference to sado-masochism.

Devoting a brief chapter of his 600-page autobiography to the perennial favourite — it won five Oscars in 1966, none of which was for him — he opened with a quote: ‘Watching The Sound Of Music is like being beaten to death by a Hallmark card.’

Plummer, who has died aged 91, played Captain Von Trapp, the widowed father of seven children, who hires a former nun to be their governess and falls in love with her.

Julie Andrews had the starring role as Maria and, though he was loath to admit it, Plummer felt intimidated.

Christopher Plummer always refused to refer to his most famous film by its real title. To him, it was The Sound Of Mucus, or S&M — a sly reference to sado-masochism. Pictured: Plummer as Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music

Yes, he was a supremely gifted, spectacularly wilful actor, utterly confident of his own brilliance. But Miss Andrews was the beloved heroine of Mary Poppins, the woman with the voice of an angel who had triumphed on Broadway and the West End in My Fair Lady, too.

Plummer, on the other hand, couldn’t carry a tune in an Alpine rucksack. He didn’t even sing in the shower — and in the finished film, though he didn’t yet know it, his voice would be overdubbed.

‘I was stricken — absolutely terrified,’ he said, at the prospect of the recording studio.

When the producers, 20th Century Fox, asked him to tape a ‘guide track’, or early versions, of the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs to assist with filming the musical scenes, he flatly refused.

The actor demanded more time, and insisted he would walk off the picture if they made him sing.

Yes, he was a supremely gifted, spectacularly wilful actor, utterly confident of his own brilliance. But Miss Andrews was the beloved heroine of Mary Poppins

The film company retaliated by threatening a $2million lawsuit. Eventually, he was flattered into line: studio chief Richard D. Zanuck visited the set and, in front of the cast, heaped praise on him until he agreed to return.

Even then, Plummer despised the part he had been given. Von Trapp was ‘very much a cardboard figure, humourless and one-dimensional . . . tepid . . . poor . . . soft-centred’.

Most actors would have welcomed the role as their big break. And Plummer, though he spent the 1950s playing supporting roles in TV dramas, had almost no film experience. Most audiences had never heard of him.

Yet he cheerfully boasted: ‘I was a pampered, arrogant young b*****d, spoiled by too many great theatre roles. Ludicrous though it may seem, I still harboured the old-fashioned stage actor’s snobbism toward movie-making.

‘The moment we arrived in Austria to shoot the exteriors, I was determined to present myself as a victim of circumstance — that I was doing the picture under duress, that it had been forced upon me, and that I certainly deserved better.’

He did add, with more than a hint of pride, that ‘my behaviour was unconscionable’. But it was small wonder that he gained a reputation during the making of The Sound Of Music, one he never lost, for being a rude, bullying, hard-drinking, priggish, loud-mouthed boor.

One morning, badly hung over, he stormed on to the outdoor set and interrupted a take with Maria and the children.

He was being grossly insulted, he roared. Everyone on the production was ignorant and disrespectful, and if he didn’t receive grovelling apologies from everyone, from the director to the canteen crew, he would quit the picture. A quailing assistant director led Plummer off the set and, begging him to sit on a park bench, asked why he was so angry.

He voiced regret for the foul behaviour of his earlier life, in particular for the way he treated first wife, Tammy: on the night she gave birth to his only child, Amanda, he left her alone to go drinking with friends. Pictured: Plummer as Commodus in the 1964 film The Fall of the Roman Empire

The actor fumed, saying he had not been given a call sheet for the day. No one had the basic courtesy to tell him where he was filming or which scenes he would be shooting. It was unforgivable!

Gently and with many apologies, the assistant director explained that Plummer hadn’t been called because this was his day off — he had no scenes that day.

Instead of backing down, the actor stormed back to his hotel and began drinking heavily, downing schnapps and beer chasers. It was left to the bar staff to talk him out of his foul mood.

If Julie Andrews detested him, no one could have blamed her. The supremely self-centred Plummer was incapable of seeing that, though: he assumed that, if she wasn’t speaking to him, it was because her admiration went too deep for words.

‘Julie was quite transparent,’ he decided. ‘There was no way she could conceal the simple truth . . . beneath my partly assumed sarcasm and indifference, she saw that I cared.

‘As two people who barely came to know each other throughout those long months of filming, we had somehow bonded. It was the beginning of a friendship — unspoken, but a friendship nonetheless.’

He was nominated again six years later for All The Money In The World (pictured), a role he took over from a disgraced Kevin Spacey, playing billionaire J. Paul Getty

Last night, as news of Plummer’s death broke, Julie Andrews paid tribute to him, saying: ‘The world has lost a consummate actor and I have lost a cherished friend.

‘I treasure the memories of our work together and all the humour and fun we shared through the years.’

But at the time, the director, Robert Wise, opted to complete as much of the film as possible without Plummer, and he was given several weeks off.

Rather than return to his wife in London, he explored Austria — visiting the opera, going to see the dancing Lipizzaner horses at the Spanish Riding School, touring the palaces.

At the Drei Husaren restaurant in Vienna, he insisted on ousting the resident musician and regaling the diners on the piano, while the professional pianist glared daggers at him. Then he announced he had sciatica and took to his hotel bed.

‘A local beauty of astonishing looks insisted on looking after me. She came regularly to my room. This sister of mercy made sure her nursing skills went far beyond the call of duty.

The actor demanded more time, and insisted he would walk off the picture if they made him sing

‘As I lay there, in heavenly bondage, at least one part of me was alive,’ he would later say.

When he returned to the set, he had put on so much weight that Wise ordered him to diet. At the time, Plummer was on his second marriage, to a former newspaper columnist named Pat Lewis.

She had interviewed him when he was at the Royal Shakespeare Company and, recently divorced from first wife Tammy, he embarked on a wild affair with the young journalist.

Plummer and Lewis became regulars on the hip Soho scene, often hanging out in clubs such as The Establishment, run by Peter Cook.

Leaving the club in the small hours one wet night, their convertible Triumph Herald careered into a lamp post outside Buckingham Palace.

Lewis, who was driving, suffered a blood clot on the brain that left her in a coma, and with multiple fractures to her skull and face. Plummer somehow managed to walk away with only scratches.

As Lewis slowly began to recover, he bought a house in Mayfair where he could nurse her, and they were married in 1962.

But his drinking, which had threatened to overturn his career for years, became excessive. For weeks on end, he would drink himself unconscious.

In 1964, he recorded a maudlin interview for Canadian TV, playing the piano and expounding on the origins of his acting genius.

He was so visibly drunk that he spoke with difficulty: ‘Sadness gives birth to tragedy and comedy, sadness gives birth to talent,’ he said. ‘Most talent comes from sadness. All beauty is sad to me.’

Born Arthur Plummer in Toronto in 1929, he was the great-grandson of a Prime Minister and grew up in Quebec, speaking both French and English.

His parents introduced him to fine wine at 12, by which time he had already had his first sexual experiences with a nanny — who was sacked after she was discovered kissing him.

By contrast, he was married to third wife, Elaine (right), for 50 years. And he even came to appreciate the role that made his name — as Captain von Trapp in The Sound Of Music

An early girlfriend told him that he thought of no one but himself.

‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘I find no other subject quite so worthy of my attention’ — a retort that he would recall proudly in his autobiography, 65 years later.

His self-confidence was extraordinary. When Laurence Olivier invited him to play the lead in Shakespeare’s Coriolanus at the National Theatre, Plummer retorted that he would tackle the role his own way and refused to let Olivier guide him.

‘Great actor, lousy director,’ he later sneered.

In another production at the National, he rounded on his co-stars on the first night and told them that they were all ‘a bunch of repertory a**eholes’. Away from the stage and the cameras, he could be even more unpleasant.

Film critic Victor Davis recalled how, at the launch of a Pink Panther film in 1974, the star lost his temper and began screaming at the journalist’s girlfriend — who had dared to speak to Plummer’s third wife, Elaine Taylor.

When Davis squared up to the actor and threatened to punch him on the nose, Plummer stalked away and sent his minder over to continue the argument.

He made a series of films that promised more than they delivered — as Rommel in The Night Of The Generals in 1967 and the Duke of Wellington in 1970’s Waterloo. Pictured: Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Plummer in an adaptation of A Hazard of Hearts

By then, his career seemed to be on the skids, sabotaged by his own propensity for making enemies of the people who admired him most.

He made a series of films that promised more than they delivered — as Rommel in The Night Of The Generals in 1967 and the Duke of Wellington in 1970’s Waterloo.

He played Rudyard Kipling in The Man Who Would Be King in 1975, a film dominated by Michael Caine and Sean Connery, who were much bigger stars.

Gradually, Plummer drifted into blockbuster cameos, where his name would lend a little cachet to the hokum. In Star Trek VI, in 1991, he played a Klingon general called Chang — though he refused to wear the prosthetic make-up that would distend his skull.

But on stage, his talent still shone. In 1997, he won a Tony award for his portrayal of Hollywood great John Barrymore. One critic said the only flaw in the production was that Plummer was a far better actor than Barrymore could ever have dreamed of being.

Offers for really worthwhile films began to arrive again late in his career. In 2010, aged 81, he was nominated for his first Oscar, as Leo Tolstoy in The Last Station. Two years later, he won Best Supporting Actor for Beginners, a romantic comedy, making him the oldest ever winner of an Academy Award.

He was nominated again six years later for All The Money In The World, a role he took over from a disgraced Kevin Spacey, playing billionaire J. Paul Getty. He was also awarded the Companion of Honour in Canada. Plummer had finally mellowed enough to enjoy success — and enough for others to enjoy working with him.

He voiced regret for the foul behaviour of his earlier life, in particular for the way he treated first wife, Tammy: on the night she gave birth to his only child, Amanda, he left her alone to go drinking with friends.

By contrast, he was married to third wife, Elaine, for 50 years. And he even came to appreciate the role that made his name — as Captain von Trapp in The Sound Of Music.

‘What a terrific movie it is,’ he mused. ‘The very best of its genre — warm, touching, joyous and absolutely timeless.’ Watching it at a children’s party, he said: ‘I felt a sudden surge of pride that I’d been part of it.’

The star passed away peacefully at his home in Connecticut with his wife Elaine Taylor at his side, Deadline Hollywood said.

Plummer, an accomplished Shakespearean actor honored for his varied stage, television and film work in a career that spanned more than six decades, was best known for his role in 'The Sound Of Music,' which at the time eclipsed 'Gone With the Wind' (1939) as the top-earning movie ever.

He flourished in a succession of meaty roles after age 70 - a time in life when most actors merely fade away. He claimed a long-awaited Academy Award at age 82 for his supporting performance in 'Beginners' as an elderly man who comes out of the closet as gay after his wife's death.

So much love shared: BAFTA, The Academy and the SAG Awards all shared statements

'You're only two years older than me, darling,' Plummer, who was born in 1929, purred to his golden statuette - first given for films made in 1927 and 1928 - at the February 2012 Oscars ceremony. 'Where have you been all my life?'

The artist became the oldest actor to win a competitive Academy Award - supplanting Jessica Tandy and George Burns, who both were 80 when they won theirs.

Plummer appeared in more than 100 films and also was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Russian author Leo Tolstoy in 2009's 'The Last Station.' He won two Tony Awards for his Broadway work, two Emmy Awards for TV work and performed for some of the world's top theater companies.

But for many fans his career was defined by his performance as an stern widower in 'The Sound Of Music' - a role he called 'a cardboard figure, humorless and one-dimensional.' In his 2008 autobiography 'In Spite Of Myself,' Plummer refers to the movie with the mischievous acronym 'S&M.'

They got along well: Dean Norris said that Plummer was a 'brilliant actor'

A fun share for fans: Pixar posted a cartoon image of the acting icon from Up

It took him four decades to change his view of the film and embrace it as a 'terrific movie' that made him proud.

Director Robert Wise's wholesome, sentimental film follows the singing von Trapp family and their 1938 escape from the Nazis. Plummer's character falls in love with Andrews, portraying a woman hired to care for his seven children. The movie won the Academy Award as best picture of 1965.

'Originally I had accepted Robert Wise's offer simply because I wanted to find out what it was like to be in a musical comedy,' Plummer wrote in his book. 'I had a secret plan to one day turn 'Cyrano de Bergerac' into a Broadway musical. 'S&M' would therefore be a perfect workout in preparation for such an event.'

He said he had never sung before in my life - 'not even in the shower' - before taking a role that included crooning the song 'Edelweiss.' He blamed his own 'vulgar streak' for the desire to star in a big, splashy Hollywood extravaganza.

'And yes, all right, I'll admit it, I was also a pampered, arrogant, young bastard, spoiled by too many great theater roles,' he wrote. 'Ludicrous though it may seem, I still harbored the old-fashioned stage actor's snobbism toward moviemaking.'

Plummer's late-career renaissance began with director Michael Mann's 'The Insider' (1999) in which he portrayed CBS News interviewer Mike Wallace, acting alongside Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.

That was followed by triumphs in director Ron Howard's Academy Award best picture winner 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001), director Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' (2006), 'Up' and 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' (both 2009) and 'Barrymore' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' (both 2011).

Plummer was born in Toronto on Dec. 13, 1929, into a privileged railroad family. He was the great-grandson of Sir John Abbott, the third prime minister of Canada.

Christopher confessed to a boozy lifestyle with plenty of affairs through the 1960s. He said his third wife, British actress Elaine Taylor, forced him after their 1970 marriage to stop the carousing that consumed some of his peers and friends, such as Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.

'Yeah, I stopped,' he told Britain's Telegraph newspaper in 2010. 'Square son of a bitch that I was, coward that I was! No, Elaine did say, 'If you don't quit this stupid over-drinking I'm outta here.' And thank God. She did in a sense save my life.'

Plummer's early films included 1965's 'Inside Daisy Clover' with Natalie Wood and Robert Redford, released the same year as 'The Sound Of Music,' 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964) with Sophia Loren and Alec Guinness, and 'Triple Cross' (1966).

Among his more colorful roles were as an eye-patch-wearing Klingon in 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country' (1991) and as an urbane jewel thief in 'The Return of the Pink Panther' (1975). He said he kicked himself for turning down the Gandalf role in the popular 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.

One of his last major roles was as another patriarch, in the dark-comedy 'Knives Out' in 2019.

His TV roles included the 1983 mini-series 'The Thorn Birds.'

In a joint statement to Complex they claimed that they 'have had difficulty' with Sabrina Peterson, who made the accusations public, for more than 10 years. They added that 'if these allegations don't end, they will take appropriate legal action.'

Peterson responded to the couple's denial by writing on her Instagram page: 'LETS TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST!'

'The Harrises have had difficulty with this woman for well over a decade. They are taking this matter very seriously, and if these allegations don't end, they will take appropriate legal action.'

Peterson made the allegations against T.I. and Tiny on Instagram by posting screen-shots of anonymous DMs purportedly by various accusers.

'Appalling allegations': In a joint statement to Complex they claimed that they 'have had difficulty' with their accuser Sabrina Peterson for more than 10 years

The accusations include sexual abuse and enabling sexual assault as well as giving someone 'an incurable std' [sic].

Peterson has previously accused T.I. of holding a gun to her head, and earlier this week Tiny took to Instagram to defend her husband from this claim.

'Hold up... So you want your abuser to train your sons? He was just uncle 2 years ago ... now when did you say my husband assaulted you? Did you change your mind or change it back? What’s up wit you today Pooh? I’m confused,' wrote Tiny.

'[I've] worked with him for many, many years and obviously I would not know what goes on in his bedroom, neither do I want to, but as far as people who think going on all my social, calling me names and putting up pictures of Marilyn and I.

'You know, there's something called a working relationship and that's what I've had with Marilyn for many years.

'Please know that the details made public do not match my personal experience during our seven years together as a couple.

'Had they, I would not have married him in December 2005. I left 12 months later due to infidelity and drug abuse. Abuse of any kind has no place in any relationship.'

While Von Teese said she had not been abused by Manson during their time together, she wished 'strength' on the women who had come forward.

Looking back: Dita wrote, 'The details made public do not match my personal experience during our seven years together as a couple. Had they, I would not have married him'

Reasons: In her statement, Dita (pictured in 2009) clarified that she left Manson a year after they got married due to 'infidelity and drug abuse'

She went on: 'I urge those of you who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself.'

Von Teese and Manson first became a couple in 2001 after previously meeting when he asked her to be in one of his music videos.

He proposed to her in March 2004 and they wed in November 2005, holding the ceremony at Castle Gurteen de la Poer in Ireland.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph in 2007, she said of their split: 'I wasn't supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him, I wasn't going to be part of that.'

Since then, at least 10 more women have spoken out over the alleged abuse they suffered at the hands of the rocker.

Manson has denied all allegations claiming in a statement Monday night they were 'distortions of reality' and insisting all of his relationships were consensual, but was dropped from his record label and talent agency when the accusations surfaced.

On Monday, five women made coordinated statements on Instagram about how Manson allegedly treated them.

They are Westworld actress Wood, 33; an artist known only as Gabriella; photographer Ashley Walters; model Sarah McNeilly; and model Ashley Lindsay Morgan.

Making a stand: Evan Rachel Wood (pictured in 2007) was among the first to publicly accuse Manson where she claimed he starting 'grooming me when I was a teenager'

They claimed they had been victims of sexual misconduct, manipulation, and physical and emotional abuse at Manson's hands.

The women's allegations vary but all say Manson left them with PTSD after forcing them into blood pacts, plying them with drugs, becoming violent with them and gaslighting them.

Westworld star Wood was engaged to Manson for eight months in 2010. She has in the past spoken about being abused but did not name her abuser.

In her statement on Monday, she wrote: 'The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years.

Breaking her silence: Ashley Walters has claimed she was hired as Manson's assistant but that he psychologically abused her. She does not specify if they had a sexual relationship

Change: L.A. based model Sarah McNeilly says Manson 'love bombed' her at the start of their relationship then became increasingly violent

'I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

'I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.'

On Monday night, another three women made allegations on social media that Wood re-posted on her account. They did not go into detail about their relationships with Manson but all three said he was an abuser.

Those women are Scarlett Kapella, Brittany Leigh, and Torii Lynn. On Tuesday, four more women made allegations against the rocker.

Artist and writer Louise Keay Bell claimed Manson 'emotionally and financially abused me and tried to control me' from the age of 19.

Actor Charlyne Yi also alleged Manson harassed her and other women on the set of the TV series House and said when she spoke out about the abuse three years ago she had received death threats.

She had initially made the claims in social media posts in 2017, yet resurfaced the allegations this week as more women came forward.

Bailey, who is trans, posted a video to her Instagram account on Tuesday evening in which she claimed that Manson told her he didn't 'like f*****s' as he held the weapon to her head while she was working at a shoot in his home in 2011.

At the time, she was allegedly attempting to help an unnamed Hollywood actress who was blackout in his room prepare for a photoshoot.

On Monday, Bailey had posted a picture of Manson to Instagram in which she called him a 'vile human'.

'I'm not a fan of cancel culture but when someone like @marilynmanson pulls a gun to your head, it's time to speak up,' Bailey wrote.

'It's 2021 and we have to take away the power of these awful people, so they don't do harm anyone else.'

Bailey followed up on Tuesday evening with a five-minute video in which she spoke at more length of her claims, as she told the Daily Beast that she is getting in touch with the authorities about her story.

She also claimed that she is keeping the name of the actress involved in the incident under wraps as they pursue legal counsel.

After Wood spoke out, Rose McGowan - another of Manson's exes and a #MeToo crusader - released a statement to say she 'stands with' her.

She has not made any allegations of her own against Manson but said: 'When he was with me, he was not like that but that has no bearing on whether he was like that with others before or after.

'It takes time to come forward. I am proud of these women.'

She added: 'I am profoundly sorry to those who have suffered the abuse & mental torture of Marilyn Manson.

'When I say Hollywood is a cult, I mean the Entertainment industry including the music industry is a cult. Cult's protect the rot at the top. Theirs is a sickness that must be stopped.'

Three accusers say they had romantic relationships with him that started with him 'love bombing them' but then turned abusive.

She is a photographer in Los Angeles and says she admired his work. It's not clear from her post when the pair met or if their relationship was ever sexual.

She says she started working for him as a personal assistant after six months, that the pair became close - 'like family - but then their relationship changed.

She said he 'frequently' became violent, once threw glass plates at her and 'offered' her up for 'sexual relationships with collaborators'.

'I continue to suffer from PTSD, and struggle with depression.

Denial: Manson released this statement in the wake of 'horrific abuse claims' against him by the five women on Monday. A further four women have now made claims

'I stayed in touch with quite a few people who went through their own traumas, under his control.

'As we all struggled, as survivors do, to get on with our lives, I'd keep hearing stories disturbingly similar to our own experiences.

'It became clear the abuse he's caused; he continues to inflict on so many and I cannot stand by and let this happen to others.

'Brian Warner needs to be held accountable,' she said.

ROSE MCGOWAN: I STAND WITH THE ACCUSERS Rose McGowan, another of Manson's exes, on Monday night said she 'stands' with his accusers and said Hollywood is a 'cult' where abuse is tolerated. McGowan has not made any allegations of her own against Manson. She was among the first to make claims against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. On Twitter on Monday night, she said: 'I stand with Evan Rachel Wood and other brave women who have come forward. It takes years to recover from abuse and I send them strength on their journey to recovery. Let the truth be revealed. Let the healing begin.' McGowan posted a video on Instagram to share her support of Manson victims. She did not make any allegations of her own She then posted a lengthy Instagram video where she said: 'I am profoundly sorry to those who have suffered the abuse & mental torture of Marilyn Manson. 'When I say Hollywood is a cult, I mean the Entertainment industry including the music industry is a cult. Cult's protect the rot at the top. 'Theirs is a sickness that must be stopped. The industrial fame complex chooses who they protect & who they'll let be their victims. For profit. 'I stand with Evan Rachel Wood and all of those who have or will come forward. 'And please don't pull out the 'why did they take so much time to come forward?' question that shames victims/survivors, it's what stops others from coming forward. 'And to all of those who have covered for monsters, shame on you. 'Rise and say no more.' Advertisement

Los Angeles-based model Sarah McNeilly also used the phrase 'love bombing'. She says Warner 'lured' her in by acting loving but then turned violent.

Among her claims is that he threw her against a wall, threatened to bash her face in with a baseball bat, locked her in a room when she was 'bad' and verbally berated her for 'hours'.

She did not give dates for when they knew each other.

'I have been afraid to bring any spotlight upon myself as to avoid winding up in his cross hairs again.

'As a result of the way he treated me, I suffer from mental health issues and PTSD that have affected my personal and professional relationships, self-worth and personal goals.

'I believe he gets off on ruining people's lives. I stand in support of all that have and all will come forward. I want to see Brian held accountable for his evil.'

Ashley Lindsay Morgan said she met Manson when she was working as a model in Thailand in 2009. She claims they had a mutual friend and that after talking and texting for months, he flew her to Los Angeles.

She did not detail how long they spent together but alleged abuse and said he also asked her to bring him Nazi memorabilia from Asia, even though she is Jewish.

She says she also 'wasn't allowed to eat or sleep or leave' his home.

'I have night terrors, PTSD, anxiety, and mostly crippling OCD. I try to wash constantly to get him out or off of me. I am coming forward so he will finally stop,' she said in part.

The fourth woman is an artist called Gabriella. She said she met him in 2015 when she was 22 and he was 46 backstage at one of his shows.

She says he 'love bombed' her immediately.

'Things went from 0 to 100 at full speed... he worked a kind of magic on me,' she said.

Among her claims is that he forced her to take drugs with him and that they made a blood pact.

'I had fallen deeply for an illusion of safety and love. Every aspect of my life was affected I suffered financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually.

'It has taken me five years to speak out. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and still suffer from nightmares. I blocked out a lot of the memories, but the feelings remain and manifest in various ways. The reason I'm finally sharing this traumatic

'Experience is for my healing and because I'm done being silent. I don't believe it's fair for someone to not be held accountable for their horrific actions.

'I'm not a victim. I'm a survivor,' she wrote.

Former porn star Jenna Jameson has also claimed Manson fantasised about burning her alive and 'liked to bite' during sex.

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the adult movie actress divulged the disturbing details about her brief affair in 1997 with the self-styled 'antichrist'.

The 46-year-old mother, who now uses her partner Leon Bitton's last name, said that unlike some of Manson's other exes' alleged experiences, she left him before he could inflict too much damage.

She said: 'Our relationship was odd. We didn't go out long because I cut it off after he would nonchalantly say he fantasized about burning me alive. Sexually he liked to bite, and it was disconcerting. He is a lot. To say the least.'

She added that although Manson didn't do anything to her without her consent, she quickly cut him loose once he expressed his twisted desires.

'Once he started speaking to me violently, I was like... goodbye Brian. Also the bruises from him biting me weren't fun,' she said.

Wife: Manson is now married to artist Lindsay Usich. They got married in lockdown in February 2020 and she has 'liked' his statement

California State Senator Susan Rubio has called for a police investigation, saying: 'As a survivor myself, I was horrified to hear of these domestic violence allegations. We need to stand with the victims. We know they are almost always isolated from loved ones, making it that much more difficult to escape or seek justice.

'Victims are usually not believed or are threatened to keep quiet, so when they do come forward, we need to support them.

'These allegations of physical, emotional and financial abuse against Marilyn Manson, also known as Brian Hugh Warner, must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.

'If law enforcement does not do that, we will not only fail these victims but future possible victims of the alleged perpetrator. We must not let that happen,' she said.

Wood also posted screenshots of tweets written by Dan Cleary - Manson's former assistant in December 2020.

He said in them that he knew Wood when she was with Manson and that by the end of their relationship, he had 'broken' her.

Wood reconciled with her English actor beau Jamie Bell after her romance with Manson ended in 2010.

She and Bell had one son together before splitting in 2013. She then revealed she was bisexual and dating a non-binary partner in 2019, but she did not reveal who they were.

In the past, Manson has denied violence through an attorney. But in a 2009 interview with Spin, he made disturbing remarks about wanting to 'smash' Wood's skull in.

He was being asked about his new album and was asked: 'It sounds like the period after you and Evan Rachel Wood broke up was really tough. What was your lowest point?'

He replied: 'My lowest point was Christmas Day 2008, because I didn't speak to my family. My walls were covered in scrawlings of the lyrics and cocaine bags nailed to the wall.

On Thursday, Rita commanded attention as she shared a racy new promotional image to celebrate the imminent release of her new EP, shortly after returning to Instagram.

The singer, currently in quarantine after flying to Australia for The Voice, unveiled the striking cover art for forthcoming track Bang with followers on the social media platform.

In her second post since returning to Instagram, she also confirmed the track, a collaboration with Kazakh DJ Imanbek and French star David Guetta, is scheduled for release on February 12th.

The post, in which Rita models a bandage strap leotard, is her first since surprising her loyal fanbase by deleting thousands of images from her grid.

Welcome back: On Thursday, Rita announced the imminent release of a new EP as she returned to Instagram after deleting all of her images

Gone: Rita had deleted all posts from her Instagram feed earlier in the day amid multiple covid scandals and during her current quarantine in Australia

Soon after the erasure, eagle-eyed fans took to Twitter to speculate over the reasoning, with many correctly claiming the move was a teaser for new music.

Twitter users penned: 'just seen this and new music must be coming! I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.9 posts on your insta!!!? New tunes must be coming x.'

Sure enough, within a few hours Rita had uploaded one new post for her 16m followers, announcing a new music project with GRAMMY-nominated DJ and record producer Imanbek.

After repeatedly coming under fire for flouting coronavirus rules in recent months, insiders told MailOnline that she was hoping for 'a fresh start', just days after it was revealed she had lost 200k followers due to her rule breaking.

Rita has just landed in Sydney ahead of filming for her judging role on The Voice and is currently in quarantine in the five star Meriton Suites Pitt Street hotel, where the penthouse suite costs $500 (£279) per night.

The new EP was written and produced over Zoom and features artists from all over the world.

'When we started this project, we were really looking to develop creative connections with other artists,' explained Rita.

'Collaborating with Imanbek was a really unique experience, we had meetings through Zoom to discuss the music and we had to use translators as well as, so we really had to adapt to a new way of recording.'

New tunes: Sure enough, a few hours later and Rita had uploaded one new post for her 16m followers, announcing a new music project with DJ and producer Imanbek

'It's amazing how much technology allowed our connection to shine through. Music truly is a universal language, and this EP is proof that creative process has the power to transcend any obstacle that separates us.'

Rita was pictured jetting into Sydney International Airport on Monday after being permitted to leave the UK during lockdown for work commitments, and will become a coach on the Australian version of the hit singing competition.

The work trip comes after Rita was branded 'selfish' by British police for holding a rule-flouting 30th birthday bash at west London restaurant Casa Cruz in November.

The party came amid another rule break, as she has previously flown by private jet to Cairo on November 21 to perform at the five-star W Hotel.

She returned the next day and under Government quarantine rules should have self-isolated for 14 days. Instead, she threw a birthday party on November 28.

The infamous birthday party at Casa Cruz saw Rita branded 'selfish', the manager of the restaurant sacked and the venue facing losing its licence.

As well as her 30th birthday bash and Cairo trip, Rita sparked fury in April last year when it was revealed she'd travelled to The Cotswolds just days before London's first lockdown.

Executives with Big Loud Records, which signed Wallen in 2016, did not respond to repeated messages from DailyMail.com on Friday, and have issued no further statements since suspending Wallen.

It remained unclear whether the label intended to forgo any revenue from Wallen's two albums, including January's Dangerous: The Double Album, which has topped the Billboard 200 for the past three week.

Big Loud also isn't saying what the 'indefinite suspension' means, or whether they would reconsider teaming up with Wallen again after a review period.

Morgan Wallen's record label Big Loud Records is remaining silent on their possible future with the country music star, after suspending him 'indefinitely' this week

Wallen's second album with Big Loud, Dangerous: The Double Album, has remained atop the Billboard 200 for three straight weeks. Labels typically take a percentage of album sales

In their only statement on the matter, the Nashville label said on Wednesday: 'In the wake of recent events, Big Loud Records has made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely'.

'Republic Records fully supports Big Loud's decision and agrees such behavior will not be tolerated,' the statement added. Wallen is co-signed with Republic.

Despite the scandal, which Wallen apologized for, his music continues to sell well on iTunes, where his albums were second and third on the Top 10 Albums list on Friday.

Record labels typically keep a percentage of the sales of each record, but the details of Wallen's contracts are unclear.

Wallen, 27, has faced tremendous industry backlash, with thousands of radio stations banning his music, and the American Country Music Awards saying he is no longer eligible for the genre's top recognition.

He is one of the country genre's biggest young stars, with his new record, Dangerous: The Double Album, spending three weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart, but the reaction from the music industry has been swift.

iHeartMedia, the largest radio station group owner in the U.S. with more than 855 stations, has banned Wallen's music from the airwaves, as have other large radio station owners Cumulus Media and Entercom.

Cumulus Media, the nation's second largest chain of stations, was the first to ban Wallen's music. Together the three companies run more than 1,500 radio stations.

The Academy of Country Music, which is currently taking nominations for their annual awards show in April, said in a statement they would 'halt' Wallen's eligibility for this year's show and will also be reviewing the awards eligibility and submission process.

'The Academy does not condone or support intolerance or behavior that does not align with our commitment and dedication to diversity and inclusion,' the ACM statement said.

The backlash came after Wallen was heard on a recording made by a neighbor and made public Tuesday, using the slur as he chatted with friends while returning to his Music City home.

Wallen was heard saying of an acquaintance, 'Take care of this p**** ass n*****' and 'take care of this p**** ass mother******' as he entered his home

The Tennessee native's neighbor recorded the country artist as he came back to his house Sunday with friends, disturbing neighbors with loud noise and car horns.

He was heard saying of an acquaintance, 'Take care of this p**** ass n*****' and 'take care of this p**** ass mother******' as he entered his home.

'I'm embarrassed and sorry,' the country music artist, 27, told TMZ, which made the video public on Tuesday. 'I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back.'

He continued, 'There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.'",Morgan Wallen's label Big Loud Records remains silent on what follows his indefinite suspension

The 35-year-old Cravings founder had surgery to alleviate pelvic pain caused from the disorder where the uterine tissue lining incorrectly grows outside the uterus instead, calling the recuperation process a 'toughie.'

A bit loopy while providing a status updated on Twitter and Instagram, she said that despite being in pain it was 'truly still better than contractions and pain from endo.'

Tough recovery: Chrissy Teigen, 35, is having a tough recovery after undergoing endometriosis surgery on Thursday, but maintains that it's better than 'pain from endo'

A worn out Teigen laid in the comfort of her own home in sweats as she said 'I'm OK, I'm all numbed up,' while showing off her abdomen scars that were covered with gauze covered in hearts.

She indulged in some classic comforts including a big old box of donuts and some binge worthy television including 90 Day Fiance and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

A bit disoriented she said, 'Usually I'm really good after [surgery], this one's a toughie. My belly got numbed. It's gonna be numbed for a couple of the next days, hopefully it'll stay that way. Every little cough makes it hard.'

Teigen maintained that she would rather cope with a painful recovery despite acknowledging 'tomorrow's gonna be worse'.

Rest up: 'Usually I'm really good after [surgery], this one's a toughie. My belly got numbed. It's gonna be numbed for a couple of the next days,' she told her followers

Simple comforts: She tried to make herself feel better by eating donuts and watching binge-worthy television

Not feeling so hot: She asked for advice on surgery the day before as she realized her recovery was a lot worse than expected

The previous endometriosis pain she had felt was tough for many reasons, as she said her period cramps felt like 'baby kicks' just a day before she had surgery, which triggered memories of her miscarriage.

Suffering a tragic miscarriage with her baby boy 'Jack' in September, the wife of John Legend said the 'kicks in her belly' were not 'phantom,' while sharing that the baby would have been born this week.

Some pre-surgery jitters, she asked her followers on Wednesday, 'Can anyone tell me their experience after endometriosis surgery? what is the recovery-difficult level? like can I make soup after?'

On Thursday evening, she provided an update as she shared a video of her lying in bed and said 'an update: holy s**t it's a no on the soup but a go on the Curb.'

Gearing up: She shared that her period had been especially bad with pelvic pain that felt like baby kicks in her stomach, only making the pain of miscarrying her son Jack who would have been born this week more painful

No soup: Not feeling strong enough to make soup based on her level of pain she laid in bed and watched Curb instead

No peace and quiet: Teigen revealed that kids Mile and Luna who she shares with Legend were being especially antsy as she said she wished they would respect her 'healing body'

She continued to say that her kids Luna, four, and Miles, two, were driving her mad as she tweeted:

'I know kids are extremely antsy beings normally but they absolutely absolutely flail, high kick and tornado more when you tell them to be careful around your healing body?? they feel the calm energy and they MUST f***in break it STAT!'

Right before entering surgery she shared a hospital selfie and wrote 'Please 'endo' this pain LOL!'

She had shared videos of her belly contracting on Twitter days prior while talking about the pain of losing Jack due to a 'partial placental abruption.'

Chrissy's Court star Teigen Instastoried a snap of herself in the hospital on Thursday ahead of her endometriosis surgery, which she captioned: 'Please 'endo' this pain LOL!'

Kicks: 'Look at this. I'll pretend it's him saying hi - it never stops' she wrote

'Look at this. I'll pretend it's him saying hi - it never stops.'

The Utah native revealed the loss boldy on Instagram as she shared photos of she and John cradling a blanket and crying in September.

To cope with the loss she has embarked on sobriety, sought grief counseling and therapy and even picked up horseback riding as a form of therapy.

'My therapist says I need something that I do for just me, as I have absolutely nothing currently lol,' she tweeted last month.'

She shared videos from Legend's Wild video shoot late Thursday- which they used as a pregnancy announcement - as she penned a heartfelt caption.

Big reveal: Teigen and Legend revealed the news of her pregnancy in his music video for Wild, now sharing that she can't look at the photos without sobbing after losing her son who would have been here this week

'I was 10 weeks along and out of my mind happy. I knew the video would take a bit to get together so thought it would be cute to share our news with the world through the ol classic hand on belly trick at the end. I could have never imagined what would happen over the next 10 weeks...not sure I'll ever be able to watch that video again without sobbing but I hope he feels my tears and knows we miss him so.'

'He would have been here any day now - if he were like Luna and Miles, I'd probably be holding him as we speak. I am so full of regret that I didn't look at his face when he was born. I was so scared of seeing him in my nightmares that I forgot about seeing him in my dreams. I hurt every day from that remorse.'

'This month is a rough reminder and to be honest, I thought the worst was over but I guess life and emotions aren't on any sort of schedule. Love you guys to pieces and am grateful for all your support and love. I firmly believe energy and healing travels through the night sky and I feel it, I promise I do. and I love you jack.

And on Thursday the tennis star was seen in her mansion in northern Miami in Florida as she posed for the March 2021 cover of Architectural Digest magazine.

'I've been working on this home for a really long time - I actually worked with my sister Venus, she has an interior design company,' said the mother-of-one as she gave a video tour of the palace.

The star at her palace: Serena Williams was seen in her mansion in northern Miami in Florida as she posed for the March 2021 cover of Architectural Digest magazine

Venus' design firm is V Starr Interiors. 'Serena is not formal,' Venus said. 'She’s fun-loving; she’s very free, and not someone who wants to sit in a chair and serve someone tea. So it had to be a very welcoming space.'

'I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,' Serena said.

And she said working with her sister is easy because they give each other space. 'You have to know your lane. I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors. But I was able to learn through just watching Venus.'

Welcome: 'I've been working on this home for a really long time - I actually work with my sister Venus, she has an interior design company,' said the mother of one as she gave a video tour of the palace

On her own: 'I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,' Serena said

The home is an intracoastal property.

The record breaker snapped it up three years ago before she wed tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian.

'We had just met,' she said. 'And I wasn’t going to be like, ""Hey, let’s do this together."" That would have been really weird for him.

It just works: And she said working with her sister is easy because they give each other space. 'You have to know your lane. I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors. But I was able to learn through just watching Venus'

She has had the home for a while: The record breaker snapped it up three years ago before she wed tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian

New love: 'We had just met,' she said. 'And I wasn’t going to be like, ""Hey, let’s do this together."" That would have been really weird for him'

A fun way to play music: The piano, which sits at the end of the gallery space, is see through as is its chair

'Yeah. That would’ve been kind of creepy,' Venus added.

Ohanian oversaw their three-year-old daughter’s bedroom and loves her castle bed that has a slide.

'She goes down the slide every night while we’re thinking, Man, we shouldn’t have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide,' Serena said.

This is a big deal in many ways: The oversized red and black painting had ladders everywhere as well as rock from the moon

A long way down: The second floor looks down to the foyer which has floating circles coming down from the ceiling

'But whatever makes her happy makes me happy.'

Serena is thrilled with how open the home is.

'When you walk in, it’s like walking into an art gallery,' said Serena. 'That’s my favorite part of the house. It’s so unique. I’ve never seen anything like it.'

Venus then shared: 'I am not a fan of just having spaces to have them. Maybe some people use their formal living rooms, but we don’t.

The media room is a place to have a good time: There is a bar in the back and several chairs with a wide screen TV

Fun for a karaoke night for the family: There are guitars and a sofa where they can sing their hearts out

Drink up: The tennis ace said that her husband bought all the alcohol but they hardly ever drink

She sure likes her hit records: Against the wall there was the record for TLC's CrazySexyCool

'So we created a space that she can actually use and enjoy and live with the art, and invite other people to absorb it and have that emotional connection as soon as you walk in. It sets the tone for the rest of the home.'

And the bare space is inviting to her.

'I love being home. When you have our job, you never get time to relax. So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything.'

In the shoot by Lelanie Foster, the athlete has on a hot pink fuchsia dress. There was no sign of her husband Alexis.

The caption on the AD Instagram site read, 'It's yet another cozy Sunday afternoon during quarantine, and @serenawilliams is lounging in her newly decorated home office on Zoom with her big sister @venuswilliams.

'It’s just two months after the tennis titans went toe to toe at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky, which was their first time back on the court since the forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

'The world-famous pair, who have played many roles in each other’s lives in the 23 years since their first match against each other—best friends, former teammates, competitors, and longtime roommates—are giggling as they reflect on the five-year journey of collaborating on their greatest joint effort yet: designing Serena’s dream home.'

Home is where the heart is: 'I love being home. When you have our job, you never get time to relax. So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything,' she said

So many interesting quirks here and there: The bookshelf also serves as a door into another room

She also shared her home off in a video for AD.

The living room stands out nicely with bright light streaming through the massive windows.

The trophy room looks like the wing of a museum: The trophies are put on a gray floating shelf. Serena has won four Olympic gold medals, 39 Grand Slam titles, 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles

And then she takes fans to the room where she keeps all her trophies. Serena has won four Olympic gold medals, 39 Grand Slam titles, 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles.

'Most homes have a normal living room... but what if I have an art gallery,' she said.

She shows off a large canvas that has a rock from the moon on it as well as ladders.

There are quick flashes of the media room and club room which has large chairs that seem to recline Lay-Z-Boy style.

Her office is not massive but it works just fine; Williams said that she does a lot of business deals in this room

Popular with the magazines: And she joked that she was 'not vain' for showing off her covers from Vogue, New York and WSJ

She's just like us! The siren had a ring light near her shelf which helps with interviews, and a can of Lysol at the ready

'I wanted something really functional,' she said. Her office is full of her magazine covers, including her Vogue cover, as she jokes she is not 'vain.'

She then showed off her trophies and jokes that she was going to throw out her second place trophy because they don't belong in her room.

And when in the media room she said she loves the popcorn machine but they 'really don't drink' so the bottles in the bar go untouched.",Serena Williams shows off her very modern mansion

'Every day I'm like, ""Well, tell me something you've probably never told me before,""' he said.

'Now, we're forced every day to have these conversations and some are deeper than others…I'm happy about this time in that regard.'

Last week, Lanez reportedly filed new documents seeking the ability to publicly discuss allegations waged against him by Megan Thee Stallion, according to TMZ.

In court documents, Lanez said it's 'unfair' that Megan can speak on the July incident in publications and across social media, but he's not allowed to defend himself due to the court order.

Lanez was arrested for a felony count of carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle, and was later charged with one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.

Megan took to Twitter last week to address rumors that the charges were dropped and said: ""AT THIS POINT IM GETTING ANNOYED! STOP BELIEVING EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE MF INTERNET.

His team says that there is 'evidence of gunshot residue implicating others,' but he's not allowed to discuss anything due to the protective order.

Megan told GQ in November's cover story that she was 'offered' money to stay quiet about the alleged shooting in July, and went on to detail how she was shot twice in the foot after leaving a pool party in the Hollywood Hills.

Megan revealed that she was simply trying to go home when she got in the car with Tory Lanez, a move she was hesitant to even make as an argument was brewing and her phone had died.

When Megan attempted to get out of the vehicle, Lanez allegedly shot at her feet and wounded her twice.

The 25-year-old British star was seen Thursday gearing up for a driving scene in Palm Springs as she sat behind the wheel of a vintage convertible.

The girlfriend of Zach Braff looked at ease as she settled into her role as Alice - an unhappy housewife who begins to lose her sanity when she suspects her husband is hiding a dark secret.

The production has gained a lot of attention in recent weeks after it was revealed that Wilde has embarked on a new romance with star Harry Styles who plays Pugh's husband in the film.

Movie magic: The vintage convertible was strapped to a process trailer to simulate her driving without actually having to do any of the work

The two were seen making a public appearance at Style's manager Jeff Azoff's wedding, just months after she and former partner Jason Sudeikis announced they were going their separate ways.

While Florence was always slated to star in the film, Styles replaced Shia LaBeouf who was fired by Wilde due to what she deems a 'no a**holes' policy on set.

In a recent conversation with Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell for Variety's Director on Director series, Wilde said 'The no a**holes policy puts everybody on the same level,' as it was revealed months prior that she fired LaBeouf after he exhibited poor behavior on set.

Wilde also gushed over Florence's professionalism, saying she always comes to set on time and is ready to 'turn it on' at a moment's notice, praising her for being all around 'incredible' to work with.

Styles was seen on set yesterday with heavy body makeup to cover his 60 tattoos. The project also stars Dakota Johnson and Chris Pine who will play mysterious neighbors in the movie which is set in the 1950s.

The production began filming again in early December, after it was halted following a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on set in November.

The Environment Agency has 16 flood warnings in place for the Thames saying that flooding is 'expected' with 'immediate action required' after it burst its banks – while there are also a further 18 less serious flood alerts.

She protested that the fact 'that I May Destroy You did not get one Golden Globe nod is not only wrong, it’s what is wrong with everything,'

'Did I take the criticism of the show personally? Of course. Who wouldn’t? But also not,' she admitted, revealing that several iconic scenes were inspired by her own experiences and faux pas as an American in Paris.

Shakira is the latest star to sell the rights to her music to Hipgnosis Songs Fund.

Relaxed: Jason Sudeikis cut a casual figure on Friday as he filmed series two of Ted Lasso in London, after his ex-fiancée Olivia Wilde appeared to confirm her romance with Harry Styles

Jason appeared to be in good spirits as he clutched a script for the show with his name printed across the front on his walk to work.

Making sure to stay warm in the chilly London climes, Jason donned a bright yellow jumper under a navy blue jacket.

The star, who also writes the show, was later seen donning some earphones during the shoot and watching on as his co-stars acted out some of the new series.

New couple alert! Olivia Wilde, who he shares two children with, was romantically linked to Harry following her split from Jason, with the pair pictured together attending a wedding

Heading to work: The actor donned a face mask as he made his way through the set

The Ted Lasso filming comes after Jason's ex Olivia and singer Harry were revealed to be dating in January.

They were first romantically linked after they were seen holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California.

The new couple previously worked together on Don't Worry Darling, which began filming in Los Angeles and Palm Springs back in October.

Wilde directed and appeared in the 1950s-set psychological horror, which stars Styles, Florence Pugh, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne and Chris Pine.

Loaded down: The star toted his script under one arm and a brown leather backpack over one shoulder

Giving notes: Jason partially removed his mask while chatting to co-star Hannah Waddingham

A source told DailyMail.com that the new couple stayed together at James Corden's house near Palm Springs during filming, where they were able to 'be alone and keep their relationship very secret.'

Another source said that the nine-year relationship between Wilde and ex-fiancé Sudeikis officially ended in early November 2020, and they were together 'as recently as this fall.'

According to People, Sudeikis wasn't even aware that Wilde wanted out of their engagement until October, around the time her relationship with the One Direction alum took off.

Casual: He rocked some Nike trainers with a navy blue jacket while filming in the chilly climes

Having fun: Hannah beamed a smile as she donned a smart caramel jacket and black trousers

Characters: Jason plays the title character, an American football coach, who travels to the UK to coach a British soccer team while Hannah plays Rebecca Welton

The insider added: 'Jason feels that the timeline that Olivia and Harry would like people to believe - that she and Jason split ages ago, long before she became involved with Harry - is simply not accurate.

'She began filming [Don't Worry Darling] in September, and by October, he began to get the impression that she wanted out. By November, they'd announced their split.'

The source emphasised 'that's how quickly it happened,' adding that 'none of it happened until she began filming with Harry.'

However, another person close to the couple disputed that interpretation: 'Olivia and Jason were broken up as of early 2020.

'The recent news that she has moved on is no surprise. Olivia and Jason's relationship continues to be focused on their children and co-parenting them.'

For the role: Jason's character Ted is easily recognisable with his bushy moustache

And another source told People that Sudeikis 'is absolutely heartbroken about the split' and her budding onset romance with Styles, as he hopes to 'repair things' in their relationship.

The insider said: 'There is still a lot of love there, and he would like to have hope that maybe there's a way for them to repair things. But what happens next remains to be seen.'

It was originally reported that Wilde and Sudeikis underwent an amicable split earlier in 2020, and they've since been adjusting to co-parenting their two children.

Keeping busy: The filming comes shortly after Jason's ex Olivia Wilde was romantically linked to Harry Styles after they were spotted holding hands at a wedding (Jason pictured during the TV shoot in London)

Claims: According to People, Jason wasn't aware that Wilde wanted out of their engagement until October, around the time her relationship with the One Direction alum took off, however another source said their relationship was over in early 2020 (pictured filming in London)

Having a good time? Hannah appeared entertained by something as she giggled and smiled for the camera

They began dating in November of 2011, later getting engaged in January of 2013, and they share son Otis, six, and daughter Daisy, four.

The exes met at the after party for the season 36 finale of Saturday Night Live, striking up a romance a few months later.

Sudeikis recounted the story on The Late Show in 2017: 'I actually came off looking a little cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends who weren’t exactly her best girlfriends, who would report back, ""Oh you know, I think she’s dating someone.""

'So I didn’t make any moves. I was just very, very busy with other things. And next thing you know, I stopped being busy, she stopped dating someone, and then it was off to the races. We sort of reintroduced ourselves. The universe had more in store for us in the fall.'

Staying safe: Jason donned a white face mask while around other members of Ted Lasso crew

All set up: The actor was surrounded by other people working on the film and equipment

Both had just gotten out of previous marriages, as Wilde was married to Italian Prince Tao Ruspoli, 45, from 2003 until filing for divorce in March of 2011, two months before meeting Sudeikis.

He married Pitch Perfect writer Kay Cannon, 46, in June of 2004, before separating in 2008 and divorcing in 2010.

The former couple starred together in the 2013 romantic drama Drinking Buddies, and he later appeared in her 2019 feature directorial debut Booksmart.

Wilde told People of directing her ex-fiancé: 'That was great. He's one of the best improvisers in the world so I knew I could cast him. He's like spinning a top and just letting it roll. It's really amazing to see him do his thing.'",Jason Sudeikis films Ted Lasso as seen for the first time since Olivia Wilde dating Harry Styles

A statement released to MailOnline from the couple reads: 'As you can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult time for our family and we remain committed to our children. Thank you for respecting our privacy.'

Alice took to Twitter to share the 'sad news', stating Ioan said he 'no longer loves her' and has left her young daughters feeling 'very sad'.

The original statement was later deleted, with Alice alleging that it was her estranged husband who had taken to her account and removed the message.

She posted another Twitter message, reading: 'Hi there. I didn't delete the tweet from a few hours ago about him leaving. He did. From my account...

'And hell yes when I am being gaslit and mentally tortured then hell yes I will wash my linen in public', however this tweet was also deleted later on.

After the now-deleted message, she was then criticised by a follower, who penned: 'Seems like a weird thing to be posting on Twitter'.

In response, in a message which remains on the page [at time of publication], Alice responded writing: 'Why? I have lost my mind'.

One follower then penned: 'I did the same when this happened to me. I think it's how one acknowledges there's no returning to what existed before. Accepting it by stating it publicly helps you to recognize the impossibility [of] reconciliation.'

She then responded: 'This is exactly why. And than you. Six months of harrassment: yes/no/maybe. I cannot live like this anymore'.

In the original shock statement, Alice penned: 'Sad news. My beloved husband/soulmate of 20 years, Ioan Gruffudd, has announced he is to leave his family, starting next week.

'Me and our young daughters girls are very confused and sad. We haven't been given a reason except that he 'no longer loves me'. I'm so sorry.'

Ioan's father claimed his 13-year marriage to Alice had been in trouble for some time prior to their split.

Peter Griffiths, 72, said news of the couple's separation did not come as a 'complete surprise' and that he had been 'aware' of problems between the pair.

Shocking news: Ioan's father claimed his 13-year marriage to Alice had been in trouble for some time prior to their split

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in Pentyrch near Cardiff, South Wales, the retired headteacher said: 'As a family you are aware of these things going on.

'I have spoken to Ioan and we are of course incredibly sad but I do not want to go into too much detail. We are very sad, particularly for our two granddaughters. It is just very sad, but these things do happen and marriages do end.'

Marriage has been 'in trouble for some time', says Ioan's father Ioan Gruffudd's father has claimed his 13-year marriage to Alice Evans had been in trouble for some time. Peter Griffiths, 72, said news of the couple's separation did not come as a 'complete surprise' and that he had been 'aware' of problems between the pair. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline from his home in Pentyrch near Cardiff, South Wales, the retired headteacher said: 'As a family you are aware of these things going on. 'I have spoken to Ioan and we are of course incredibly sad but I do not want to go into too much detail. 'We are very sad, particularly for our two granddaughters. It is just very sad, but these things do happen and marriages do end.' Advertisement

In a telling sign, Ioan spoke of their relationship struggling in February 2020.

He told The Guardian: 'I think we've struggled the past four years, making time for each other because physically we're apart.'

The couple's daughters were conceived through IVF after discovering Alice had a low antral follicle count at the age of 38.

They welcomed their first child after one round of IVF, while their youngest girl arrived after eight rounds of treatment - which costs upwards of £7,000.

Alice wrote in the Daily Mail in 2016: 'Extremely high blood pressure earned me total bed rest for the last two months of the [first] pregnancy and then there I was, in a hospital bed, sweating and screaming and writhing about – just like on television.

'A mere 40 hours later Ella arrived, a 6lb 2oz lobster-red baby-alien. Instantly none of my other plans mattered. This was the thing I should have done years ago. The only thing. It was as close to being in heaven as I'd ever get.

'This time our first cycle failed. As did our second. Our third didn't even produce any eggs to fertilise. Our fourth gave us a few to freeze. It wasn't working.

'Finally, physically, mentally (not to mention financially) depleted, we decided sadly that cycle eight would be our last. Elsie Marigold Evans-Griffith was born on September 13, 2013.

'She has her dad's big brown eyes but not his unfeasibly long tongue, thank goodness. I know how lucky I am. I won the lottery. I get to kiss goodnight to the two most precious human beings I've ever met. My goal now is to get the word out. Don't wait until it's too late.'

The couple met on the set of 102 Dalmatians in 2000, when Alice was in a relationship with Pablo Picasso's grandson Olivier.

The pair became engaged six years later after she gave him an ultimatum about their relationship, and tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Mexico in September 2007. Ioan previously gushed about their strong bond and 'fantastic relationship'.

He stated in an interview with Who: 'When we first got engaged, there were a lot of people who were like, ''Oh actors who are married can get quite difficult because there's too many egos involved.'' But we've just had a fantastic relationship.'

In 2017, Alice spoke about a 'sinister' encounter she had with disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, just hours after Ioan screen-tested for one of his movies in Cannes in 2002.

Alice claimed the producer propositioned her and invited her to join him in a hotel bathroom.

Comments: Alice defended her messages in a duo of exchanges with followers

Ioan shared his support for as he said in an interview with The Sunday Post in 2018: 'I just wanted to hold her hand and walk her through it. She's an extraordinary woman, fiercely strong and bright and one of the bravest people I know.'

He added to The Guardian last year: 'I was very proud of Alice. Because women were not being believed.

'She wanted to say, 'No, this is definitely his modus operandi. This is how he behaves. I've witnessed it.' So she wanted to present the case, help bolster the case.'

Alice was born in New Jersey to British parents, teacher Janet and university lecturer and mathematician David.

She was raised in Bristol with her brothers Anthony and Philip, and temporarily worked in Paris after studying Italian and French at the University College London.

Early beginnings: The couple met on the set of 102 Dalmatians in 2000 (pictured), when Alice was in a relationship with Pablo Picasso's grandson Olivier

Alice frequently updates fans with images of her family and credits Piers Morgan's journalist wife Celia Walden, actress Joanne Froggatt and socialite Lady Victoria Hervey as her close friends.

Ioan's parents were also educators, and the Amazing Grace star grew up in a Protestant non-conformist household with his younger siblings Alun, 45, and Siwan, 40, in Cardiff.

He first featured in Welsh TV film Austin at the age of 13, before he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and appeared in TV shows and films such as Poldark, Titanic and Hornblower.

During the early stages of his career, the star lived with fellow actor Matthew Rhys - who served as best man at his wedding - for nearly 10 years.

Indie singer Bridgers tweeted Thursday claiming she visited Manson's home as a teenager and the 52-year-old rock star showed her a room he described as his 'rape room'.

She said she 'stopped being a fan' following the incident and 'stand[s] by' the women who have accused Manson of abuse stretching back many years.

Her comments came just hours after cops swarmed the rock star's Hollywood home Wednesday night to carry out a 'welfare check' after a concerned friend was unable to get in touch with him.

Manson has been rocked this week by accusations from at least 11 women including actor Evan Rachel Wood who said he groomed and 'horrifically abused' her for years.

Manson has denied all allegations calling them 'distortions of reality' but has since been dropped from his record label and talent agency.

Bridgers joined the mounting list of women to make accusations against Manson in a social media post Thursday.

'TW: I went to Marilyn Manson's house when I was a teenager with some friends. I was a big fan,' Bridgers wrote in the social media post Thursday.

'He referred to a room in his house as the 'r*pe room',' she wrote

The singer said at the time she thought it was a poor joke but is now throwing her support behind Manson's alleged victims.

'I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor,' she tweeted.

'I stopped being a fan. I stand with everyone who came forward.'

In a follow-up tweet, Bridgers called Manson's label, management, and band all 'f**ing pathetic' and claimed everyone 'knew' about his behavior.

'The label knew, management knew, the band knew. Distancing themselves now, pretending to be shocked and horrified is f**ing pathetic,' she wrote.

At least 11 women have now come forward to accuse Manson of abusing them including claims of abuse, sexual assault, sleep deprivation, and one alleged incident where he held a gun to a woman's head.

LAPD cops were called to Manson's Hollywood Hills home over concerns for his safety Wednesday night amid the growing number of allegations against him.

Four police cruisers and an LAPD helicopter were dispatched to Manson's home around 6.00pm to perform a 'welfare check' on the 52-year-old after a concerned friend couldn't get in touch with him, reported TMZ.

An LAPD spokesperson told DailyMail.com officers from the North Hollywood division responded to a call for a welfare check at a home on the 3400 block of Troy Drive, Studio City, around 6.00pm Wednesday.

Sources told TMZ the call was made by a friend of the singer who had grown concerned something had happened to Manson when they couldn't get in touch with him for several hours.

Officers arrived on the scene and tried to make contact with Manson numerous times but no one answered the door.

They also knocked on the doors of the rock star's neighbors on both sides.

After getting no response from Manson the cops left the scene returning with more officers and a police helicopter around two hours later, a witness told The Sun.

There was a heavy police presence with four cop cruisers on the ground while a police helicopter circled overhead, shining a spotlight onto the home.

On Monday, five women made coordinated statements on Instagram about how Manson allegedly treated them.

They are Westworld actress Wood, 33; an artist known only as Gabriella; photographer Ashley Walters; model Sarah McNeilly; and model Ashley Lindsay Morgan.

They claimed they had been victims of sexual misconduct, manipulation, and physical and emotional abuse at Manson's hands.

The women's allegations vary but all say Manson left them with PTSD after forcing them into blood pacts, plying them with drugs, becoming violent with them and gaslighting them.

Westworld star Wood, now 33, was engaged to Manson for eight months in 2010.

She has in the past spoken about being abused but did not name her abuser.

In her statement on Monday, she wrote: 'The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years.

'I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

Artist Gabriella claimed she dated Marilyn Manson for six months between 2015 and 2016 and that he drove her to attempt suicide after tying her up, depriving her of sleep and plying her with drugs during their relationship which began when she was 22 and he was 46.

She shared photographs of herself with Manson and texts she says he sent her to add validity to her story.

On Monday night, another three women made allegations on social media that Wood re-posted on her account. They did not go into detail about their relationships with Manson but all three said he was an abuser.

Those women are Scarlett Kapella, Brittany Leigh, and Torii Lynn.

On Tuesday, four more women made allegations against the rocker.

At least 11 women have now come forward and accused Marilyn Manson of abusing them

Manson, real name Brian Warner, released this statement in the wake of 'horrific abuse claims' against him by the five women on Monday

Visual filmmaker Love Bailey claimed Manson once held a gun to her forehead.

In an Instagram video she claimed that Manson told her he didn't 'like f*****s' as he held the weapon to her head while she was working at a shoot in his home in 2011.

Musician Chloe Black spoke out on Instagram to allege Manson deprived her of sleep, made racist and anti-Semitic comments and that she once 'thought he was actually going to kill me.'

Artist and writer Louise Keay Bell claimed Manson 'emotionally and financially abused me and tried to control me' from the age of 19.

CALIFORNIA SENATOR DEMANDED FBI PROBE INTO MARILYN MANSON A WEEK BEFORE THE ACCUSERS WENT PUBLIC California State Senator Susan Rubio requested an FBI and Justice Department probe into Marilyn Manson more than a week before his accusers went public with their claims. On January 21, Rubio wrote to the FBI and Attorney General demanding an investigation into Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. She demanded that investigators contact his accusers to find out more about their claims. On Monday morning, Evan Rachel Wood and four other women posted statements alleging years of 'horrific abuse' by Manson in what appeared to be a coordinated move. On Monday night, Wood posted a photo of Rubio's January 21 letter on her Instagram account. Now, Rubio's office is refusing to say how they knew about the abuse allegations early. Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department will confirm if they have opened an investigation. Rubio's letter reads: 'The alleged victims have named Marilyn Manson, also known as Brian Hugh Warner, as the perpetrator. 'I ask that the U.S. Department of Justice meet with the alleged victims immediately and investigate these accusations,' Senator Rubio wrote in the letter. 'As a domestic violence survivor who now advocates for victims in my role of California state legislator, I share a common trauma of emotional, psychological, and physical control at the hands of an abuser.' Rubio added that she was 'especially alarmed' because some of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place in California. Advertisement

Former porn star Jenna Jameson told DailyMail.com this week that Manson fantasized about burning her alive and ‘liked to bite’ during sex when they dated back in 1997.

Manson has denied all the claims since they started surfacing.

He said: 'Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

'My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.'

Comments were turned off the post, but it was liked by Manson's wife, Lindsay Usich. She has not released her own statement.

Manson's ex-wife Von Teese addressed the allegations leveled at Manson in a statement on Instagram Wednesday.

In it, the 48-year-old burlesque star said she had been 'processing the news' about her ex, who she dated for six years before they tied the knot in 2005.

Von Teese insisted the experiences detailed by Manson's alleged victims 'do not match' her own experience with the rock star.

'Please know that the details made public do not match my personal experience during our 7 years together as a couple,' she wrote.

'Had they, I would not have married him in December 2005.'

She said she left Manson and filed for divorce 12 months after they wed 'due to infidelity and drug abuse.'

While Von Teese said she had not been abused by Manson during their time together, she wished 'strength' on the women who had come forward.

'Abuse of any kind has no place in any relationship. I urge those of you who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself,' she wrote.

Von Teese said she also appreciated the 'kindness' of people who voiced concern for her 'well-being' following the news this week.

Rose McGowan, one of Manson's former girlfriends, also said in a statement that while he was never abusive to her, she 'stands with' the accusers on Monday.

Manson has since been dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Records, talent agency CAA and he has been edited out of American Gods and Creepshow, two shows he was taking part in.

There are now also questions around how the allegations came to the surface.

California State Senator Susan Rubio wrote to the FBI and the Justice Department demanding an investigation into Manson on January 21 - a week before the claims became public.

Andrew Parker, Baron Parker of Minsmere, will take up his new role as Lord Chamberlain on April 1, succeeding Earl Peel who is retiring after more than 14 years in the post.

Baron Parker served as director general of the MI5 from April 2013 until last year and was a career intelligence officer having joined the MI5 in 1983.

He hosted the Queen's first visit to MI5's headquarters in central London in February last year, when she praised the intelligence agency's officers for the 'tireless work you do to keep our country safe'.

Earl Peel, 73, delayed his retirement amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis while the search for his successor took place.

He was due to step down at the end of 2020 but extended his notice period by around three months.

During his MI5 career Baron Parker led the intelligence agency's response to the July 7 London terrorist attacks in 2005, and the following year his teams played the lead role in the disruption of al Qaeda's attempt to attack multiple airliners with bombs hidden in drinks bottles.

He was later promoted to deputy director general of MI5 in 2007 before becoming head of the security service in 2013.

He retired from the post in April last year and in an interview that month said the pandemic could force ministers to 'adjust the dials' on public spending, potentially taking cash away from areas such as the intelligence agencies in the future.

But he insisted that MI5 was able to continue its work during the lockdown, adding that potential threats to the country were also subject to the restrictions.

Baron Parker will head the Queen's working household and it will be his job to ensure the smooth running of all the different departments.

The post of Lord Chamberlain, which pays around £90,000 a year, is a part-time one and includes chairing regular meetings of all heads of department.

The Lord Chamberlain oversees all senior appointments in the household, is the channel of communication between the sovereign and the House of Lords and ensures co-ordination between Buckingham Palace and Clarence House.

The position dates from the Middle Ages, when the King's Chamberlain often acted as the king's spokesman in council and parliament.

On ceremonial occasions, the Lord Chamberlain carries a white staff and a gold key, the symbols of his office.

The 30-year-old Canadian singer, born Abel Tesfaye, enjoyed a leisurely meal on the football field in a new commercial before getting bombarded by footballs dropping from the sky.

The video served as one of many final promotional pushes ahead of the big game this Sunday, February 7, where the Kansas City Chiefs will take on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

A bountiful spread of fruits, jello, and shrimp cocktail around him, the meal had all the makings of a good time.

Raining footballs slowly began to storm down as the always cool artist continued on with his business, shielded by the protection of a striped umbrella.

Perfection: Tesfaye put up $7M of his own money to make his performance 'what he envisioned' he told Billboard

The most watched program nationally every year with over 100M concurrent views, he was able to secure the coveted performance slot, even putting up $7M of his own money to 'make this halftime show be what he envisioned,' he told Billboard in late January.

'We've been really focusing on dialing in on the fans at home and making performances a cinematic experience, and we want to do that with the Super Bowl,' he said.

Additionally he shot down rumors that there would be any 'special guests' joining him on stage in an NFL interview with Kay Adams on Thursday.

'I wouldn't bet on it. There wasn't any room to fit it in the narrative and in the story I was telling in the performance so, yeah, there's no special guests,' he said.

He even got words of encouragement from former Super bowl halftime performer Lenny Kravitz who told CNN 'I'm sure [The Weeknd] is going to do a great job. He's very talented and has great music, so I expect a great performance.'

Though an exciting honor, many thought snagging the slot caused him to be snubbed by the 2021 Grammys, receiving no nominations despite having some of the year's number one hits and being submitted in six categories.

Sources told TMZ in November that his camp was reportedly given an ultimatum by the Grammys months prior - if he chose to move forward with doing the halftime show he would not be performing at the Grammys.

Though the reports of the purported negotiations between Tesfaye's camp and The Grammys have not been unverified as the final straw leading up to not receiving any award consideration, many insiders believed it indeed played a part.

He called the institution 'corrupt' but maintained to Billboard, 'I personally don't care anymore,' as he looks to

'If a topic on one of my songs is money, the other topic, I want it to be about something else. When I started rapping, when I first put music out, like my mixtape, it was all... This might sound crazy, but I got really inspired by Drill Chicago music.

'Nowadays, people just want to rave about everything. I feel because people have been wanting me and Megan to collab, so when a record like that was too freaky... I guess they wasn't really expecting that, or something.'

However, the song also garnered much criticism, particularly from prominent Republicans on US cable networks.

'You're not really doing s**t. And I'm not a person that likes to talk about my sensitive feelings. I don't like to always rap about when I'm super sad and everything. It's really hard to express certain feelings that I've got inside of me.

'It's really hard for me to express that.

The Wall Street actor was marking the one year passing of the Spartacus star at age 103.

In his caption, the Emmy winner made a comment about how his father was lucky to exit when he did as 2020 was an awful year. Not only did COVID-19 spread across the globe but there were deadly BLM protests and lives were lost at the Capitol riots in Washington DC.

A sweet tribute: Hollywood star Michael Douglas shared an image to Instagram with his father Kirk Douglas on Friday. The Wall Street actor was marking the one year passing of the Spartacus star at age 103.

'Can’t believe it’s been a year since you left us. At 103, you picked a good time to check out. I love you with all my heart! #KirkDouglas,' wrote the Streets of San Francisco actor.

Kirk was born in 1916 in New York and went on to have a very active film career with his most notable film 1960's Spartacus.

He also appeared in 1956's Lust For Life and 1962's Lonely Are The Brave.

At the time of his death he was wed to Anne Buydens. He had four sons: Michael, Eric (who passed in 2004), Joel and Peter.

A hero to many: Kirk was born in 1916 in New York and went on to have a very active film career with his most notable film 1960's Spartacus

Another hit for this vet: In the 1949 movie Champion directed by Mark Robson

In December, Michael shared a rare photo of his son Cameron and his growing family.

The actor posted to Instagram after Cameron, 42, and his girlfriend of four years, Viviane Thibes, welcomed their newborn baby boy Ryder T Douglas into the world earlier this week.

Sharing the sweet family snap that also featured the couple's three-year-old daughter Lua, Douglas wrote: Congratulations Cameron and Viviane! Welcome to the world Ryder T. Douglas! #ProudGrandpa.'

Close family: Michael with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones and dad Kirk in 2006

All together now: Kirk, far left, seen with Michael, Catherine, their two kids and extended family in a rare group photo from 2019

Wife of twenty years Catherine Zeta-Jones, 51, also congratulated Cameron and Viviane as she wrote, 'And a new Douglas is born!!!!! Welcome to the world Ryder T. Douglas,' while sharing the photo to her Instastory.

In the photo which was originally posted by Cameron to Instagram, the beaming family stood by a window as Vivian cradled the baby while Cameron looked at the camera with his arm around his partner.

Lua who sat in a princess dress had a priceless emotion on her face and looked wholly unamused to no longer be the only child in the family, as Michael joked, 'Don't think Lua is sure about this yet! What a holiday present.'

Catherine also could not but help take notice of the her unhappy face as she wrote, 'Lua's Face! like.....'whatever..........' Hilarious! Congrats!!'

The Basic Instinct actor's eldest son who he shares with former partner Diandra Luker, Douglas seemed over the moon to be welcoming another grandchild into his life (he also shares son Dylan, 20, and daughter Carys, 17, with Zeta-Jones).

Despite being born into Hollywood royalty, Cameron had a longtime struggle with addiction to cocaine and heroin through his teens and early adulthood which eventually landed him in prison.

In 2009 he was arrested in an NYC hotel room with crystal meth and served out seven years in prison (two of which were in solitary confinement) for selling and possession of drugs.

Speaking about his troubled past in his 2019 memoir Long Way Home - which Michael encouraged him to write - he said:

Troubled teen: Despite being born into Hollywood royalty, Douglas' drug use at an early age had lasting consequences and he served 7 years in prison (two of which were in solitary confinement) and he was released in 2016

'I can’t go back and change a lot of my decisions and the pain and the wreckage that some of those decisions have caused. What I did endeavor to do was to take those experiences and turn them into something useful.'

Also crediting the birth of Lua and his girlfriend with keeping him clean and leading a better life for his family, he told People in 2019:

In November last year, Michael opened up about his 2002 split from Kate, admitting he was forced to the return to Britain as she remained in the US with Lily.

The Welsh actor and London-born Kate, 47, went their separate ways after seven years together, but the split was made all the more complicated because they'd only recently settled in the US with their daughter Lily.

Speaking about the time apart, he said: 'I remember when Lily was born, I was working and going away and doing stuff and I really missed that time with her.'

On Lyra meanwhile, he said: 'I have a baby daughter Lyra coming up to 16 months old. The extraordinary thing is that for most of her life we have been going through this whole pandemic and the lockdown and stuff.

'She was only a few months old when it kicked off. Overall it has been a strange experience. On the one hand it has been amazing because we haven’t been able to focus on much else. It has just been us with her...

'Because of circumstances we’ve been together the whole time.

On the negative side of lockdown, he said: 'It is very peculiar. A lady came to do a covid test. I am on my way to America to film. We have to quarantine for two weeks in an approved country. So we are, at the moment, in St Lucia.

'A lady just came to do our Covid test. She was wearing a red top, a larger lady and a white mask on it. And Lyra the whole way through it kept going: ‘Santa, Santa.’ We all laughed about it...

'What a weird time for kids of their age or any age to grow up in. She’s barely played with any other kids. The adults she meets have all got these masks on.

'Under normal circumstances we would be going out, a lot. I am about half an hour from my mum and dad. There is a beach which is lovely. Before the lockdown we would go down there all the time. It’s a lovely place to go to the beach.

Happy days: Michael's fears were, thankfully, never realised, as he went on to enjoy a hugely successful career on both sides of the Atlantic

Last year, during his chat about Kate, he said: 'Going through that experience of a relationship breaking down and having a young child, and then because of my daughter and her mum living in another country, having to make a life in a new place whilst going through that whole experience which is difficult enough.

'I had no work visa to stay in America, so every time I left, I had to go back to Britain. I never knew if I would be allowed to come back in again.

'So, I ended up having to get work in Britain because I wasn't really getting any work in America. It really made me question certain things about myself.'

Heerdegen also claimed he had to check their son's bottles of breast milk for fear of it being contaminated with alcohol she drank the night before.

His filing came just days after Ricci accused her estranged husband of physically abusing her.

She said she had to hide knives in the house because she feared he could kill her after he allegedly said he would only feel sorry for her if she was 'dismembered into small pieces.'

Heerdegen's attorney Larry Bakman told DailyMail.com in a statement that, though the judge denied the request for a temporary restraining order, he believes the court is 'more concerned' by the allegations made by his client than those made by Ricci.

'A reasonable inference is that the Court is far more concerned with Mr. Heerdegen's allegations particularly with respect to the best interest and safety of the couples' child.'

In Heerdegen's request filed Friday, he claims he feared his child was being fed with 'alcohol polluted breast milk'.

'On those occasions in which I found ''contaminated'' bottles, I would have to throw them out to ensure that our infant was not being fed with alcohol polluted breast milk,' he says in the filing.

He says the photos 'severely adversely affected my emotional calm and peace of mind.

Heerdegen claims at one point she was so drunk she fell over while holding their baby in her arms and says she would drive their son in a car while under the influence.

He goes on to claim that Ricci once terminated a pregnancy without his knowledge.

'I was particularly devastated upon learning of this,' he said. 'It resulted in a brief separation as I left the family house in order to contemplate whether I wanted to continue on in the marriage. Ultimately I decided to reconcile with Petitioner and moved back into the family.'

Heerdegen also tells of a time in August 2015 when they traveled to Savannah, Georgia, while Ricci was filming a show for Amazon.

He says they threw a small party for their son who had just turned one. Heerdegen says he left the party and returned to find Ricci drunk which 'resulted in her launching into a drunken tirade in front of my son, informing me that she had slept with a producer on her show, and calling me the most vile of names and making bizarre threats.

'The following day [Ricci] claimed to have no memory of what she had said or done. When I inquired about her statement that she had slept with a producer on the show, she stated to me that she most likely said that in order to ''hurt me''.

'Prior to our separation in June of 2020, [Ricci] would drink to excess on an almost daily basis causing her to engage in emotionally abusive and offensive conduct directed towards me wherein Petitioner during her rants and raves would typically call me a 'fu**ing cu*t,' he writes in the filing.

The actress accused Heerdegen of allegedly beating her, throwing her into a fire pit and mocking her with pig noises before she filed for divorce in June last year.

Ricci's allegations were included in a request for a domestic violence restraining order against Heerdegen, which a judge approved late on Wednesday.

Photos of bruises on her hands, wrists and arms were included in the court documents, which were obtained by TMZ, as proof of Heerdegen's alleged abuse.

Heerdegen claims at one point Ricci was so drunk she fell over while holding their baby in her arms and says she would drive their son in a car while under the influence

But in Heerdegen's filing, he claims any photos she has of her own bruising was caused by her hitting him.

Ricci's attorney Samantha Spector said in a statement to DailyMail.com that Heerdegen's filing is 'nothing more than a transparently abusive attempt to silence my client. It will not work. Christina will not be intimidated by Mr. Heerdegen and his barrage of misleading claims – and she remains determined to protect her family.'

A judge ordered Heerdegen to remain at least 100 yards away from Ricci and their son Freddie. He also cannot have visitations with the boy and must stay away from the family's dog.

The couple married in 2013 after two years of dating. They met on the set of ABC's Pan Am.

Alongside the shot, Chrissy, who is mother to Luna, four, and Miles, two, penned a heartbreaking caption detailing her heartache and revealing that Jack's due date was imminent and February was particularly painful.

Memories: Chrissy Teigen tragically revealed this time is a 'rough reminder' of her late son Jack's due date as she shared throwbacks from a shoot when she was pregnant

Chrissy shared a trio of striking shots from the shoot while detailing her emotions in the accompanying caption.

She wrote: 'I was 10 weeks along and out of my mind happy. I knew the video would take a bit to get together so thought it would be cute to share our news with the world through the ol classic hand on belly trick at the end.

'I could have never imagined what would happen over the next 10 weeks...not sure I’ll ever be able to watch that video again without sobbing but I hope he feels my tears and knows we miss him so,' she continued.

'He would have been here any day now — if he were like Luna and Miles, I’d probably be holding him as we speak.'

Heartbreaking: Chrissy and John revealed in September that their son Jack was stillborn

Way back when: She posted behind-the-scenes images from her husband John Legend's Wild music video, which the couple used to announce their baby news in August last year, before tragically losing their beloved son in September

'I am so full of regret that I didn’t look at his face when he was born. I was so scared of seeing him in my nightmares that I forgot about seeing him in my dreams. I hurt every day from that remorse,' she wrote.

Chrissy said February had been a 'rough reminder' and admitted she 'thought the worst was over,' even though her 'life and emotions aren't on any sort of schedule.'

She concluded her post: 'Love you guys to pieces and am grateful for all your support and love. I firmly believe energy and healing travels through the night sky and I feel it, I promise I do and I love you jack. I miss you so so much.'

Chrissy and John shared the story of losing their son to a partial placental abruption in heartbreaking detail last year, and their candour was widely lauded for helping women discuss the often-taboo matter of baby loss.

WHAT IS A STILLBIRTH? A stillbirth occurs when a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby dies before 24 weeks of pregnancy, it is known as a miscarriage. Not all stillbirths can be prevented, however, not smoking or drinking, as well as not sleeping on your back and attending all antenatal appointments can reduce the risk. What are the signs? Signs may include the baby not moving as much as normal. Pregnant women should contact their doctor immediately if they notice a difference to their baby's movement. What are the causes? Stillbirths do not always have an obvious cause but may occur due to complications with the placenta or a birth defect. They are also more likely to occur if women suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or an infection that affects the baby, such as flu. Stillbirths are more likely to occur if women are having twins or multiple pregnancies, are overweight, smoke, are over 35 or have a pre-existing condition, such as epilepsy. What happens after a stillbirth? If a baby has died, women may wait for their labour to start naturally or they may be induced if their health is at risk. Bereavement support groups are available to parents who have suffered stillbirths. Some find it helpful to name their baby or take pictures with them. Source: NHS Choices Advertisement

In their original post, Chrissy wrote on Instagram: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before...

'We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough.

'We never decide on our babies’ names until the last possible moment after they’re born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever.

'To our Jack - I’m so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn’t give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you.'

She added: 'We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience. But everyday can’t be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.'

Happy family: Chrissy and John tied the knot in Italy back in September of 2013, and they share daughter Luna Simone, four, and son Miles Theodore, two

The Cravings cookbook author was previously put on bed rest, before she was hospitalized for excessive bleeding from her placenta.

She explained on her Instagram Story: 'It's always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him.

'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn't getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'

On Wednesday, Chrissy spoke on Twitter about Jack.

She wrote: 'My little jack would have been born this week so I'm a bit off. I truly feel kicks in my belly, but it's not phantom. I have surgery for endometriosis tomorrow...but the period feeling this month is exactly like baby kicks. sigh.'

In pain: The Cravings cookbook author shared her behind-the-scenes post while recovering from surgery to address her endometriosis earlier on Thursday

The Cravings cookbook author shared her behind-the-scenes post while recovering from surgery to address her endometriosis earlier on Thursday.

She looked at the camera from her hospital bed in one snap from her Insta Stories while joking, 'Please endo this pain lol lol lol.'

The disorder is a condition in which tissue that normally lines the uterus begins to grow outside of it, which can lead to debilitating chronic pain.

Ouch: 'I'm OK. I'm home now. I'm all numbed up,' she said sleepily while panning her camera to show the bandages on her stomach where she was operated on

Other celebrities, including Lena Dunham, Padma Lakshmi and Julianne Hough, have been open about the pain they have suffered as a result of their endometriosis.

After her surgery, Chrissy shared some videos from her recovery while she was still feeling sluggish from the anesthesia.

'I'm OK. I'm home now. I'm all numbed up,' she said sleepily while panning her camera to show the bandages on her stomach where she was operated on.

She was relaxing in bed while watching episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm and chowing down on a box of doughnuts.

Instead of caging them in stuffy, superfluous designs, her clothes prioritised freedom of movement, mobility and comfort. She broke down sartorial codes by borrowing elements of men's fashion, such as pockets and tweed, and erased waistlines and bustlines to create androgynous silhouettes.

image copyright Reuters

South Africa has put its roll-out of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant.

Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa.

The study, involving around 2,000 people, found the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases.

But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe infections.

South Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million cases of coronavirus and 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. The country has received 1m doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was due to start vaccinating people this week.

Speaking at an online news conference on Sunday, South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings.

In the meantime, he said, the government will offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks.

What does it mean for serious cases?

The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed.

The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"".

Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus.

The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found to reduce severe disease by 89%, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prf Madhi.

""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC.

Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases.

""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.

She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year.

Prof Tulio de Oliveira, an epidemiologist at the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, said he hoped the vaccine would still have a role to play in South Africa's inoculation programme.

""Our hope is that despite the very low efficacy on a small phase two trial in South Africa on the mild infections, that we would still see some efficacy on severe infections,"" he told the BBC.

Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness.

Early results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants.

Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising.

The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way.

Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator.

Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue.

The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant.

But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings.

What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation.

What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus.

Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this.

What do we know about the variant?

The South Africa variant carries a mutation, called N501Y, that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread.

However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions.

At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant.

[],https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55875683,[],Two errors from Liverpool keeper Alisson gift leaders Manchester City a 10th straight Premier League win and a 10-point lead over the champions.,[''],en,,https://www.bbc.com,,set(),"Manchester City took a potentially decisive hold on the Premier League title race as they thrashed Liverpool at Anfield - helped by a virtuoso performance by Phil Foden and a nightmare display from the champions' goalkeeper Alisson.

City's comprehensive triumph, their first at Anfield since 2003 and Pep Guardiola's first away to Liverpool as a manager, was achieved in such comfort that they were able to recover from Ilkay Gundogan's first-half penalty miss.

Gundogan, who skied his spot-kick after Fabinho fouled Raheem Sterling, made amends when he put City ahead four minutes into the second period, after Alisson could only push out Foden's shot.

Mohamed Salah equalised for Liverpool from the spot just after the hour after he was hauled back by Ruben Dias - but then came the combination of Alisson's errors and Foden's genius as the hosts were run ragged.

Alisson was punished for two poor clearances as Foden set up Gundogan to put City back in front after 73 minutes, then three minutes later the Brazil keeper inexplicably sent a pass straight to Bernardo Silva, whose clever cross was headed in almost on the goalline by Sterling.

City saved the best until last when Foden, the game's outstanding performer and watched by England manager Gareth Southgatei, thundered a magnificent finish high past the beleaguered Alisson seven minutes from time.

The emphatic victory leaves City five points ahead of second-placed Manchester United, having played a game less - and 10 points ahead of Liverpool with a match in hand.

Payback time for Guardiola and Man City

Manchester City and Guardiola have had some miserable days and nights at Anfield since Jurgen Klopp became Liverpool manager - this was the game, the performance and the scoreline that made this almost the perfect day.

Guardiola's incendiary reaction to Gundogan's first-half penalty miss demonstrated how much he wanted to win this game and perhaps how he feared history repeating itself. But his frustration was short-lived as City produced a second-half masterclass that left the champions badly beaten.

And while the Reds will point to their collection of injuries as a reason for their fall from grace, it should also be pointed out that City were missing the brilliance of midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and the predatory instincts of striker Sergio Aguero.

It was only a rare error from Dias that gave Liverpool hope - although Sadio Mane headed over in the first half and Ederson saved well from Roberto Firmino - and once Gudogan restored City's advantage there was only one winner here.

Liverpool performance was good enough to draw - Klopp

At the heart of it all was the brilliant Foden, head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch and flourishing even more when Guardiola cleverly removed Riyad Mahrez and placed the 20-year-old England international on the right flank.

He made two goals and scored a sensational fourth as City put down a marker and confirmed their status as the team to beat in the title race. It was also a 14th straight win, which equals the all-time winning run by an English top-flight team, shared with Preston in 1892 and Arsenal in 1987.

City have been growing in stature in recent weeks, imperious in defence and threatening in attack - but this ruthless dismissal of an opponent that has haunted them at Anfield in the recent past is their most powerful statement of intent yet.

Alisson sums up Liverpool despair

The sight of Liverpool keeper Alisson slumping in dejection after Foden's shot tore past him into the roof of the net - he could barely have seen it - for Manchester City's fourth goal summed up the sheer misery of the champions.

As Liverpool have won Premier League and Champions League titles, the 28-year-old Brazilian has been one of their most reliable figures, a game-changer to place alongside the arrival of defender Virgil van Dijk.

However, he suffered arguably the biggest nightmare of his Liverpool career on Sunday, making two bad clearances in the build-up to City's crucial second goal, then compounding it with an even worse error as he picked out Silva standing all on his own with an inexplicable pass, the Portuguese accepting the invitation to set up Sterling.

Alisson is the first Liverpool keeper to make two errors leading directly to a goal in a single game since Loris Karius against Real Madrid in the Champions League final in May 2018

Liverpool showed occasional flashes of the old flair in the first half but ended up outclassed and on the receiving end of their third successive Premier League home loss, City following in the footsteps of Burnley - who ended the Reds' 68-match unbeaten league run at Anfield - and Brighton.

In reality, it was City - so organised, composed and determined to press Liverpool - who were vastly superior over the whole piece.

Of course, Liverpool injuries will take a heavy toll, but this was a tough 90 minutes for midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who is struggling to adapt to the pace of the Premier League and made life difficult for himself with a needless early foul on Gundogan that brought a yellow card.

Guardiola impressed by Man City commitment

And while much is rightly made of the attacking prowess of full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, they struggled to cope with City's width as Sterling and Foden exposed them brutally at times.

Liverpool look very flat at Anfield and the stats say it all. They are the first side to lose three straight home matches the season after winning the title since Chelsea in March 1956 and have 27 points fewer than they did at the same stage last season - the biggest drop by any reigning champions in top-flight history.

Klopp clearly felt this was not the day to risk his deadline-day centre-back signings Ben Davies and Ozan Kabak, but they still looked horribly vulnerable.

Liverpool's manager and their players have enjoyed some triumphant days against City here in recent seasons - this was not one of them.

'Two massive mistakes and a genius' - what they said

Liverpool manager Klopp told BBC Sport: ""I saw a really good game and big mistakes. In each game, when you make these kind of mistakes, it's very likely you concede goals.

""It's easy to agree that the first half was a really good game, two sides really trying a lot to cause problems for each other, and I liked a lot I saw in the game.

""Coming out in the second half, they changed the system and we didn't move enough in midfield. We scored our goal and in that moment it was possible the game goes in our direction, but Alisson made two massive mistakes, gave two goals away - and then a genius situation from Phil Foden.

""The confidence could have suffered after the last game but tonight I saw a very confident team, if I'm honest. I liked the football we played. It's very difficult to explain that we lost 4-1.""

Manchester City boss Guardiola told BBC Sport: ""I have a lot of emotions, many things happening in the game. Gundogan missed a penalty - it's like a routine against them - but we started really, really well, doing what we want to do.

""In the second half, the way we reacted to the goal, the way we played with quality, made the difference.

""For many years we were not able to win here. Hopefully next time we can do it with people. Anfield is so intimidating.""

Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: ""It is an important win, but it is February. Of course, the gap to fifth is big right now and [qualifying] for the Champions League next season is important - but 10 wins in a row in this period is something exceptional.""

Man City not on the spot but Foden shining amongst youngsters - the stats

Four of the past six penalties to have missed the target completely in the Premier League have been by Manchester City players, with three of those coming against Liverpool (Mahrez in October 2018, De Bruyne in November 2020 and Gundogan on Sunday).

In comparison, Liverpool have converted their last 19 Premier League penalties, with Salah scoring 13 of those.

City's Sterling won his 21st penalty in the Premier League - more than any other player in the history of the competition.

Sterling is only the third player to score 100 or more goals under Guardiola, after Barcelona's Lionel Messi (211) and City team-mate Aguero (120).

Of all players to score at least 10 goals within the top five European leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) this season, only Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland (20 years 2021 days) is younger than Manchester City's Foden (20 years 255 days).

Since netting his first goal of the season on 15 December, City's Ilkay Gundogan has scored at least three more Premier League goals than any other player (nine).

What's next?

Liverpool visit third-placed Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT kick-off). Manchester City travel to Championship side Swansea City in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday (17:30) and then host Tottenham Hotspur in the league on Saturday (17:30).

[],https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55875680,[],Harry Kane makes a surprisingly speedy return from injury to solve Tottenham's scoring struggles and pile more misery on West Brom.,[''],en,,https://www.bbc.com,,set(),"Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have both scored in the same Premier League game on six occasions this season

Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho says Harry Kane will break ""every possible record"" after returning from injury to inspire Spurs to victory over West Brom.

Kane returned ahead of schedule from ankle problems to help end Spurs' three-game losing streak, with his 208th Tottenham goal drawing the England captain level alongside Bobby Smith and behind only Jimmy Greaves in Spurs' all-time scoring list.

Tottenham had failed to score in both matches Kane, 27, had missed but he took Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's through ball into his stride to slot home and break stubborn Albion's rearguard resistance early in the second half.

""Harry Kane is a special player in the history of the club,"" Mourinho told BT Sport.

""He is one of the best strikers in the world. The team depends a lot on him, we can't hide that.

""It's the goals he can score, the assists he can make, the link play he has, that personality that players like that can have and he is always an important influence for us.""

Kane's goal was his 13th in the Premier League this season, taking him ahead of strike partner Son Heung-min for all of four minutes until the South Korea striker sealed Spurs' victory with an emphatic finish from Lucas Moura's pass.

Victory moved Spurs up two places to seventh, four points off the Champions League places, although that position and gap could change later on Sunday with Chelsea and Liverpool in action.

West Brom remain 19th and 11 points behind 17th-placed Burnley despite an improved defensive display.

Recent loan signing Mbaye Diagne was unlucky not to register his first Baggies goal on three occasions. The Senegal striker's first-half header forced a fine save from Spurs skipper Hugo Lloris and he also saw two second-half finishes ruled out for offside.

Kane in the record books

Tottenham: Joint second on 208 goals, alongside Bobby Smith - 58 behind Jimmy Greaves (266)

Premier League: Ninth on 156 goals - 104 behind Alan Shearer (260)

England: Sixth on 32 goals - 21 behind Wayne Rooney (53)

Kane's goal against West Brom was his 20th in all competitions for Spurs this campaign, a milestone he has passed in his past seven seasons - if he keeps up his scoring rate and, of course, stays at Spurs, he could be on course to break Greaves' record by the time he turns 30.

Of the eight forwards above Kane on the all-time list of leading Premier League marksmen, only Sergio Aguero (180) is an active player, while none of the five strikers ahead of him on the England charts are still playing.

Kane and able - Harry's return kick-starts Spurs

Leading into Sunday's game, both teams appeared to be in varying degrees of disarray. Two months ago, Spurs topped the Premier League but had dropped to ninth, seven points off the top four, while a bedraggled West Brom had fallen increasingly adrift from safety.

From minute one, Kane's return clearly boosted the hosts who, as they have historically done, boasted a far greater cutting edge with him than they had during the two games he missed.

Since the 27-year-old became a Spurs regular in the 2014-15 season, Tottenham have won 56% of Premier League games when he has been available but just 41% without him. Their average goals-per-game figure drops from 1.9 to 1.2 with him out of the side.

Tottenham failed to score against Brighton and Chelsea during Harry Kane's brief spell on the sidelines

Those discrepancies have been magnified even further during Mourinho's reign - Spurs' win ratio in the league has dropped from 51.4% with him in the team to 30% without, losing five of the 10 matches he has missed, while both points and goals per game slip from 1.8 to 1.1.

While the limitations of the opposition are a factor that should be taken into account, Spurs looked a different side with their talismanic forward, enjoying more touches in the opposition box in the first half (15) than they did in the entirety of Thursday's dour 1-0 defeat by Chelsea.

Kane could have had a first-half hat-trick but his finishing was atypically wasteful, lashing one chance on to the stanchion behind the goal and dragging another wide before finally forcing a near-post save from Sam Johnstone.

He made amends by holding his run perfectly to avoid being flagged offside for his coolly taken opener and, having set up Son for an earlier chance that Johnstone saved well with his legs, also played a part in the swift break that ended with the South Korean drilling home the second.

Kane continues to underline his importance to a Tottenham side who really do appear lost without him, with Son stressing the impact his fellow striker's return had made on both he and the team.

""Harry Kane is so, so important for us. It was only a couple of games but we missed him a lot. Him coming back and scoring straight away, it's what we needed. I missed him,"" said Son.

Still no joy against Mourinho for Allardyce

West Brom boss Sam Allardyce relegated in-form playmaker Matheus Pereira to the bench in a bid to shore up Albion and cure the defensive ailments that have plagued their campaign, having conceded a mammoth 54 goals in 22 games.

It worked to an extent as Albion frustrated their hosts for long spells but they were still reliant on Kane's first-half wastefulness, as well as a smart save from Johnstone to thwart Serge Aurier's far-post header.

Had they displayed this sort of defensive fortitude in previous games, West Brom might not be in the desperate position in which they find themselves.

Three apparent opportunities fell to on-loan Galatasaray forward Diagne. However, the two that he stuck away - a close-range header and a prodded finish - were both scored from offside positions, whereas when he did stay the right side of the Tottenham defensive line he headed too close to Lloris, who still did well to save down low.

Ultimately, West Brom were undone by Spurs' quality in the opening 15 minutes of the second half and it was another defeat for Allardyce against Mourinho, who he has never beaten in 13 attempts - three draws and 10 losses.

Allardyce will be heartened by the impact of several transfer-window signings - Diagne's liveliness suggested he will score goals at this level, Robert Snodgrass delivered good crosses and Ainsley Maitland-Niles made an assured, if understated, debut.

But after just one win in 13 games, and with the teams above the relegation zone continuing to regularly collect points, the Baggies will need a miraculous turnaround to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.

'That lapse can't happen' - what they said

Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Sport: ""I'm not used to losing three matches in a row and Tottenham is the same, so we have to admit that it was not a week where we felt very, very comfortable, but I was very positive because of what the players showed in this game. I knew that they would.

""I think we played very well but I'm speaking about the mentality the players brought to the game.

Moura was everything - Mourinho

""The players are together, the players want to win, they are committed and today they went to the pitch only with one thing in their mind and that was to win the game. This was the thing that pleases me more, the way the players approached it.""

West Brom boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: ""The downside is letting the goals in after containing them in the first half. Seeing Harry Kane in our box unmarked. That lapse at this level just can't happen. We should be stopping that at source.

""Then we let them go from their box to our box without putting a mark on anyone. We scored, it got disallowed, we scored again and that was disallowed but at least we scored two 'goals' here. If we get the right service in the box we've got a man who can score.

""Until we shut the back door, better life is going to be difficult for us. This is it now, the window is shut, we've got what we've got. We've got to start winning games and we won't do that by keeping on losing. We need an undefeated run with more wins than draws in it.""

West Brom need to beat a top team to stay up - Allardyce

More Sunday sorrow for Baggies - the stats

West Brom have failed to win any of their past eight Premier League games on Sunday, losing seven times.

Tottenham have lost just one of their past 27 Premier League home games against promoted clubs (W24 D2), going down 3-1 against Wolves in December 2018.

Only in 2016-17 (14) has Tottenham's Son Heung-min scored more goals in a single Premier League campaign than the 13 he has netted already this season.

Spurs' Harry Kane has now scored in 13 of his past 15 Premier League appearances against newly promoted opposition (14 goals) including each of the past six - the first player to manage that since Mohamed Salah between January and December 2018.

Only Callum Wilson (40%) and Dominic Calvert-Lewin (38%) have scored a higher portion of their team's Premier League goals this season than Spurs duo Kane and Son, who have both netted 13 each (13/36 each - 36%).

Substitute Dane Scarlett (16y & 320d) became Tottenham's youngest player to make an appearance in the Premier League.

What's next?

Tottenham visit Everton in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday (20:15 GMT) before travelling to leaders Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday (17:30 GMT).

West Bromwich Albion host Manchester United in the Premier League next Sunday (14:00 GMT).

Guinness Six Nations: Wales v Scotland Wales: (6) 21 Tries: North, Rees-Zammit Cons: Halfpenny Pens: Halfpenny 3 Ireland: (13) 16 Tries: Beirne Cons: Sexton Pens: Sexton 2, Burns

Wales took advantage of Peter O'Mahony's 14th-minute red card to beat Ireland in their Six Nations opener.

Flanker O'Mahony became the first Irishman to be sent off in the Six Nations following a reckless elbow to the head of prop Tomas Francis.

Ireland bounced back to lead 13-6 at half-time through a Tadhg Beirne try and Johnny Sexton's boot.

Tries from George North and Louis Rees-Zammit and 11 points from Leigh Halfpenny sealed success for Wales.

But they nearly lost it at the death, with a penalty giving Billy Burns the chance to kick for the corner and a potential match-winning line-out drive, only for the replacement Ireland fly-half to kick the ball dead, to Wales' huge relief.

It was a fourth win for Wales coach Wayne Pivac in 11 competitive matches and the first against a leading nation following previous successes against Italy and Georgia.

Ireland are still to win an away game under Andy Farrell despite the 14 men of Ireland enjoying territory and possession advantage while Wales' forwards dominated the tackle charts.

It was a bruising battle with Wales losing Dan Lydiate, Johnny Williams, Hallam Amos and Tomos Williams to injury.

Ireland lock James Ryan failed a head injury assessment and skipper Sexton's afternoon ended 11 minutes from time when Wales flanker Justin Tipuric's knee accidentally caught him in the head.

After playing the autumn series at Parc y Scarlets, Wales returned to their Principality Stadium home after the iconic ground had been used as a coronavirus hospital in 2020. The eerie Cardiff city centre atmosphere belied what the Welsh capital would usually be like on international day.

After a period of experimentation, Pivac returned to some tried-and-tested men by picking the most experienced Wales starting side in history.

Captain Alun Wyn Jones played his first game for two months after recovering from a knee injury and was sporting a black eye following an altercation in training with Jake Ball, who was not named in the squad.

Wales had already been disrupted by suspended duo Liam Williams and Josh Adams, the latter due to a Covid-19 breach.

A cagey start saw Leigh Halfpenny open the scoring before his opposite number Hugo Keenan demonstrated his attacking abilities with an incisive break.

Dan Lydiate's first international match for more than two years was cut short after his right leg buckled underneath him, forcing the flanker off to be replaced by Josh Navidi.

The game's controversial moment came in the 14th minute when O'Mahony was red carded for a reckless arm to the head of Francis when trying to clear out a ruck.

Referee Wayne Barnes showed the Munster man a deserved red and it looked as if the game's complexion would change.

Irish indiscipline continued with a high tackle from Sexton on Johnny Williams, allowing Halfpenny to double the lead.

Wales head coach Wayne Pivac reflects on his side's win over Ireland

Wales centre Williams and Ireland lock James Ryan were both forced off with head injuries before Sexton opened the Ireland account with two penalties to level the scores.

Wales' line-out woes continued and another failure set up the platform for Robbie Henshaw to burst through a missed Justin Tipuric tackle and release Josh van der Flier, with Tadhg Beirne following up to dive over.

Sexton converted as Ireland deservedly led 13-6 at half-time, at which point Wales lost scrum-half Tomos Williams to a hamstring injury to the final move of the half.

It was a masterful first-half performance of game management orchestrated by Sexton as Wales were starved of possession and forced to make three times as many tackles as the visitors.

Replacement scrum-half Gareth Davies entered the fray before North crossed for Wales' opening try with an excellent break for his 42nd Wales try in his 99th international. Halfpenny missed the conversion as Wales trailed by two points.

The hosts regained the lead with a fantastic finish from Rees-Zammit in the right-hand corner with Halfpenny converting.

'One or two silly penalties' cost us - Ireland head coach Farrell

A thunderous charge from CJ Stander bounced Faletau on his backside before a Halfpenny penalty gave Wales an eight-point advantage.

Wales rung the changes which included a major backline reshuffle with replacement fly-half Callum Sheedy coming on for wing Amos. The alterations included Biggar moving to full-back and Halfpenny switching to the wing.

Ireland lost Sexton after his head caught the left knee of Tipuric before his replacement Burns reduced the deficit to five points with a penalty.

In a frantic finale, Gareth Davies needlessly kicked the ball away with 10 seconds left before Tipuric produced a wonderful tackle on Garry Ringrose as Ireland battered away at the Wales defence.

Ireland had a final chance, but Burns inexplicably kicked the ball dead from a penalty as a delighted Wales secured victory.

Man of the Match

Loose-head prop Wyn Jones was given the official accolade as he epitomised Wales' efforts against a relentless Ireland side with Tomas Francis, Alun Wyn Jones and Justin Tipuric also playing their part

Line-ups

Wales: Leigh Halfpenny; Louis Rees-Zammit, George North, Johnny Williams, Hallam Amos; Dan Biggar, Tomos Williams; Wyn Jones, Ken Owens, Tomas Francis, Adam Beard, Alun Wyn Jones (capt), Dan Lydiate, Justin Tipuric, Taulupe Faletau.

Its groundbreaking voyage still has an impact today.,"['future', 'ARTICLE', 'story', 'oceans']",en,2021-02-04 00:00:00,https://www.bbc.com,,{'Oceans'},"It was once a private house, but now the imposing stone structure on Boswall Road, on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth in Edinburgh, is part of a palliative care hospice.

The building shares its name with the one of the deepest parts of the ocean and two Nasa spacecraft. One was the command module for the Apollo 17 Moon mission while the other was part of the Space Shuttle fleet, and the first of them to be lost – Challenger.

Challenger Lodge was once owned by John Murray, a famous pioneer of oceanography whose travels took him almost as far as it is possible to get from Edinburgh and still be on Planet Earth.

The vessel he lived on for three years in the 1870s is what ties together the house on the firth, the deepest part of our ocean abyss, and Nasa's spacecraft. HMS Challenger was a Royal Navy ship built in the 1850s. It has entered history thanks not to a famous fighting career but a reputation earned by something far more painstaking. A three-year-long voyage – one of scientific observation rather than naval power projection – which traversed the globe on a 68,000-nautical mile (125,900km) journey.

This voyage, which Murray was part of, changed the way we view the oceans. And along the way it discovered species living in the dark depths below. Not hundreds, but thousands.

***

The oceans were the highways of the late 19th Century. With freight-carrying jet aircraft a century away, and railways yet to traverse huge swathes of the world, massive amounts of world trade relied on ships. But despite their vital place in commerce and colonial power, the deep oceans might as well have been on another planet.

The ancient Roman and Greeks had painstakingly – and fairly accurately – mapped the coastlines of the Mediterranean Sea. But while their cartography mapped the shorelines, the seas around them were regarded as a realm of ship-claiming monsters and gargantuan serpents. When the Ancient Greeks first started exploring outside the Mediterranean, some 2,900 years ago, the discovery of a strong north-to-south current made them believe they had discovered a huge river. From the Greek for river – okeanos – came the word ocean.

For centuries, oceanography remained in relative infancy. Coastlines were charted, species hauled up in nets were drawn and pored over, and depths recorded with weighted lines. But much of the ocean – especially its cold, invisible abyss – remained a mystery.

After the age of exploration, and Europe's violent colonisation of much of the globe, attention started turning to what lay under the surface of the sea. These early attempts were sporadic, however, and only ever explored a tiny fraction of the oceans at a time. It was only in the 1760s that the first dedicated oceanographic mission – a Danish expedition to the seas around Egypt the Arabian Peninsula – took place, gathering specimens using nets and simple dredging equipment.",The quest that discovered thousands of new species

Cassidy George tracks the rollercoaster history of this divisive trim.","['culture', 'ARTICLE', 'story', 'fashion']",en,2021-02-05 00:00:00,https://www.bbc.com,,{'Fashion'},"Though there are some honourable proto-mullets in the 18th and 19th Centuries (Benjamin Franklin, James K Polk), the mullet as we know it didn't become a popular style until the 1980s. Stylist, salon owner and UAL associate lecturer John Vial remembers the haircut rising to prominence in correlation with more gender-fluid styles and New Romanticism. ""The mullet has a very special place in our lives, because it really started to change the boundaries of what was accepted for men and women."" With its eye-catching and dramatic shape, the mullet – which fuses traditionally masculine and feminine styles into one – was especially attractive to the queer community, for whom the style became a nonverbal cue of their sexuality. ""From an LGBTQ point of view, it was an incredibly safe place to be. If you were a lesbian who wanted to feel slightly more boyish, you could wear your hair shorter around the frame and have the safety of the length in the back. The same applied to boys who wanted a bit more hair,"" Vial said.

Under the guidance of rock stars, actors, athletes and other pop cultural figures, the mullet entered a golden age of popularity, adopted by people across age ranges, races, classes, gender expressions and nationalities. The most famous mullets of the era are the more extreme strain, belonging to stars like Billy Ray Cyrus, John Stamos, Rod Stewart and Andre Agassi - but let's not forget that heartthrobs like Brad Pitt, Patrick Swayze and George Clooney had mullet moments too. Black celebrities including Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and James Brown donned the edgy cut, as did female performers, like Cher, Joan Jett, Jane Fonda and Ellen DeGeneres. Henderson describes the haircut's zenith in Mullet Madness: ""Whether you were metal, country, yuppie, or punk, jock or biker, it was your style.""

Rising from the ashes

Saying the mullet fell out of style in the mid-90s is a dramatic understatement; it was condemned as perhaps the most tragic fashion faux pas of the decade. In this period, the cut (which is known by countless other monikers, like hockey hair, the bi-level, the Kentucky waterfall and so on) finally earned the name by which we know it today, thanks to the musical group, Beastie Boys. In their now defunct magazine Grand Royal, they attacked the style in a six-page feature. The story reads: ""There's nothing quite as bad as a bad haircut. And perhaps the worst haircut of all is the cut we call The Mullet.""",Thoroughly modern mullets: Style's unlikeliest comeback

Text conversations with work friends, New York City friends, old friends and relatives helped me stay connected during the once-in-a-generation crisis. We laughed at memes, calmed each other down, checked in on each other’s families.

But as the pandemic went on, I found group chats made my stress worse, not better. My phone was already constantly lighting up with news notifications, and the 50 or 60 missed texts that I could get in an hour from any one group chat made me feel anxious about putting it down. I felt guilty for not responding to a text right away, or checking in on a group thread. I couldn’t exactly come up with a good excuse, either – what was I going to say: “Sorry I missed your message, I was too busy staying at home doing nothing for the eighth consecutive month”?

Group threads have always caused some people anxiety, even before the pandemic. But as someone who embraced them before the pandemic, it’s surprising to discover that in the age of social distancing, it’s possible to suffer from social overload. If they give us solace and connection in a crisis, why do some of us feel burnt out and overwhelmed by them?

‘Communication debt’

Lockdown has meant that many more of us are using messaging apps. Text messages are casual, immediate and research shows that we like them more than emails. By late March, for example, WhatsApp had already reported a 40% spike in the number of users. A study in September of more than 1,300 US adults showed that use of digital communications of all kinds increased during Covid, with text messaging leading with a 43% jump.",How texting makes stress worse

Long light rays of an overcast afternoon mingle with smoke wafting in from the trout being prepared in the scullery next door. Indigenous Colombian chef and environmentalist Anibal Jose Criollo presides over the team inside the humble cabin, pausing to greet a neighbour delivering a basket of fruit while his six-year-old niece Helen sits in a corner, playfully sifting blackberries.

50 Reasons to Love the World - 2021 Why do you love the world? “Because there is a lovely moment when the potato or the arracacha is ready to be harvested and you go past in the morning or at night, and you have the smell of the flowers, and they are special because when they don't have pesticides this aroma leaves you wanting to stay there.” – Anibal Jose Criollo, chef and environmentalist More Reasons to Love the World

Between stoves and an immense square table in the middle of the cabin’s creaky wooden centre, Criollo prepares a mix of local and ancient specialities – herido de frutas rojas silvestres (a warmed alcoholic drink made with a mix of wild red berries), trucha ahumada (smoked trout) from the lake, quinoa arepas and a pork caldo (broth) from a pig that formerly resided in Criollo’s shagra (an ancestral indigenous food garden).

This region of Colombia, with its cool climate and high-altitude plains, is known for being different to the rest of the nation, culturally far closer to other Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, which it borders. Here in the furthest reaches of the Incan empire, the Pasto indigenous people stood firm against Emperor Huayna Cápac, leading him to give them the name ""past awá"" or ""people of the scorpion"" because he supposedly said he ""wanted to step on their heads and they bit me with their tail"".

After resisting the Incan imperial advances, the Pastos were later overwhelmed by the Spanish colonial invasion and successive waves of Catholic missionaries.

""[The Spanish] took away our culture... and in the process annihilated us,"" said Criollo. ""But one thing they cannot annihilate is the feeling of ownership of a territory, and that attribute of the territory which is food.""

Today, Pasto communities still live in what is now Ecuador and southern Colombia, and they are still fighting to maintain their cultures, which is epitomised by the philosophy of Buen Vivir (""Living Well"").

""Buen Vivir in a few words, is learning to value myself as a human being... learning to value the other and learning to value and care for the environment in which one develops themselves,"" said Criollo.

Buen Vivir is a pluralistic worldview that's prevalent among indigenous communities across Latin America

Buen Vivir is a pluralistic worldview that's prevalent among indigenous communities across Latin America and whose principles are shared by different cultures around the world. Similar to the concept of ubuntu from South Africa, it holds that an individual’s wellbeing can only be achieved through harmonious relationships with the wider community – including people, the environment, other living beings, their ancestors and the cosmos. Practically speaking, it encompasses themes like food sovereignty, land rights, environmental justice, economic solidarity and the protection of local biodiversity.

According to Criollo and other environmental activists, in an era of coronavirus and climate crisis uncertainty, there has been a global awakening that our way of life need to become less individualistic and more sustainable. Now, the guiding social and environmental principles of Buen Vivir are being considered by outside communities.

The philosophy resonated powerfully for Criollo when his restaurant Naturalia closed for seven months during the Covid-19 lockdown. Without his primary income, Criollo sustained his family and himself by growing broad beans, potatoes and arracacha (an Andean vegetable that resembles a cross between a carrot and celery root), among other crops in his shagra. He also made yoghurt from his cows and traded with others in his community through a cooperative-sharing system called mindala.

Fellow Pasto Nancy Margoth Estación Puenayan is part of the Shagreros of Panam Association, whose 26 participating families use their shagra gardens to cultivate traditional seed varieties through growing food and medicinal plants. Puenayan describes the mindala system as, ""the things that we don’t consume ourselves we share, also sharing knowledge about planting and gastronomy.""

The UN's Food and Agriculture Association worked in the Nariño department with Pasto communities like Puenayan’s and in 2013 prepared the Mindala and Shagra guide, showing to outside communities the viability of these ancestral models to construct and promote autonomy, sovereignty, security and biodiversity.

Protecting the environment is also a central mission for the Shagreros of Panam Association, and in 2018 it won an award from the Nariño government, in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Program, for its work in planting native trees which helped to protect the area’s water sources.

If I plant a tree, it then takes care of me. It provides me with seeds, it gives me water, clean air

“If I plant a tree, it then takes care of me. It provides me with seeds, it gives me water, clean air. Each tree is an ecosystem, one supporting insects and biodiversity,” said Criollo, who also works with neighbouring families to reforest areas with native plant species. Working with indigenous and peasant farming families, he has helped to ensure that La Cocha lake – which is considered sacred to indigenous communities – received Ramsar status as a protected wetland, and expanded the area's network of around 100 civil society nature reserves – a Colombian conservation model where private individuals devote part of their land to environmental protection.

“What are we connecting? Conservation, clean food production, caring for seeds and looking at culture through the lens of food,” said Criollo. And with Covid-19, this interconnectedness has enabled many more people to revaluate their relationship with the planet.

“One of the impacts of the pandemic has been to work towards integral health, highlighting the importance of recuperating the balance between man and nature,” said Luis Eduardo Calpa, who works with the Basque Mundukide Foundation to support Criollo and Puenayan by promoting agroecology, community self-management and responsible consumption by connecting small-scale producers with traditional chefs. “Now the proposal of the indigenous communities has much more validity,” Calpa added.

Like other indigenous communities, the Pastos’ traditional ways of life have historically been marginalised, first by Spanish colonialists and then by indifferent national governments. But Colombia’s 1991 Constitution recognised indigenous people’s rights to their own territories and legal and economic systems. Additionally, Colombia’s Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence notes how indigenous land is not only the basis for subsistence, but it is also a living entity that is intimately entwined with indigenous communities' cultural and spiritual practices.

Now indigenous and farming communities in southern Colombia are increasingly mobilising to grow healthy food, promote supportive local economies, use ancestral seeds and protect the environment, with shagras and the mindala system forming the cornerstones of this revival.

Alba Portillo is the founder and coordinator of the local Guardians of the Seed Network, which currently shares and cultivates more than 2,500 traditional, heirloom and non-genetically modified food species with rural farmers and urban consumers. She says seeds are a sacred part of understanding Buen Vivir, and that the spiritual relationship people have with food is nurtured through cultivating and caring for what you eat.

Portillo says that a large part of what the network does is to fight the crisis brought about by big agriculture that relies on chemical fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and genetically modified seeds instead of those whose unique traits were carefully bred over thousands of years.

""We have lost more than 80% of our agro-biodiversity, which means for each one gone, we have lost a story, an inheritance, an identity in the territory,"" said Portillo.

The philosophy of Buen Vivir is also gaining wider recognition among non-indigenous Colombians. In November 2020, the Colombian government created a Buen Vivir fund to finance entrepreneurial projects in indigenous communities. Last May, the ground-breaking documentary series El Buen Vivir (“The Good Life”) launched on YouTube and Colombian television. The series showcased how nine Colombian indigenous communities incorporate, live and embody the concepts of Buen Vivir, with each film created and directed by indigenous filmmakers.

And while Colombia is regularly ranked by Gallup as one of the happiest countries in the world, Buen Vivir researcher Martin Calisto Friant, says this seems to speak more about how people there have strong community and family structures and are not dependent on the state or a capitalistic market.

The land nourishes us, it feeds us, it teaches us, it takes care of us, and so we leave it as our inheritance for the next generations

In a research paper, Fraint notes that Buen Vivir is the opposite of capitalistic consumerism. Those who follow it aspire for a democratic society where happiness is not bound by material accumulation. It focuses on solidarity, reciprocity and citizenship, thus sharing many elements with recent concepts like degrowth and slow economy.

In Friant’s native Ecuador, the government of former president Rafael Correa took radical steps to popularise the principles of Buen Vivir, making it a fundamental pillar of the country’s new 2008 constitution and creating a short-lived secretariat in 2013 to support its implementation. Further afield, countries like Iceland, New Zealand and Scotland are exploring alternative indicators to GDP to measure citizen wellness. For decades, the mountain kingdom of Bhutan has used Gross National Happiness (GNH), integrating a mix of spiritual and social markers to measure its citizens' wellbeing.

Most recently, on 2 February 2021, the landmark Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was released. Commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the report calls for a transformational change in our economic approach to nature and proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity.

Back outside in his shagra, Criollo walks with his niece Helen, showing her how the scraps from the kitchen get fed to earthworms or pigs. Helen squeals with joy as she holds a cuy (guinea pig), a local regional delicacy, and collects eggs from under a cackling hen.

""This is an education you can’t find in schools,"" said Criollo, who believes that the most important part of Buen Vivir is that it is intergenerational. ""The land nourishes us, it feeds us, it teaches us, it takes care of us, and so we leave it as our inheritance for the next generations.""

The Super Bowl transcends football. Some people who didn't care about watching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom ""Big Coat"" Brady battle reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs and QB Patrick Mahomes tuned in just for the halftime show by Grammy Award-winning singer The Weeknd. They got a special-effects-heavy spectacle that included hit songs like The Hills, Can't Feel My Face and Blinding Lights and drew mixed reviews from fans.

The Weeknd didn't sport the bandages and bloody face makeup he's worn in some recent appearances, though a field full of dancers did wear mummy-like face wraps. And his set stretched from the stands on to the field, and included a mirror-filled sequence that made it look like he was singing in a carnival funhouse.

Before the game, The Weeknd said he was psyched to perform.

""We all grow up watching the world's biggest acts playing the Super Bowl and one can only dream of being in that position,"" the singer said in a statement. ""I'm humbled, honored and ecstatic to be the center of that infamous stage this year.""

Ready for The Weeknd: Who is he?

Born in Toronto to Ethiopian immigrant parents, The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) began his career the 21st century way -- uploading songs to YouTube back in 2010.

According to Grammy.com, he chose his stage name because he dropped out of high school and left ""one weekend and never (came) back home."" His stage name is missing an ""e"" because there was already a Canadian band known as The Weekend.

He's since won three Grammys, eight Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and nine Juno Awards. He's appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live three times. His last SNL appearance came in March 2020, just before the pandemic locked most things down. In that show, he startled audiences with his bandaged face, but the look was part of the act.

""The significance of the entire head bandages is reflecting on the absurd culture of Hollywood celebrity and people manipulating themselves for superficial reasons to please and be validated,"" he told Variety, in a teasing and mysterious interview. (The New York Post has a lengthy timetable of the singer's bloody-bandage look.)

What he delivered

He didn't wear the bandages in the Super Bowl show, or in a 30-second ad for his halftime performance. In it, he's dressed in an all black outfit, complete with leather jacket and shiny shoes, and seen walking through a stadium tunnel toward the field.

In a 10-minute press conference, The Weeknd confirmed he's put his own money into getting just the Super Bowl sets he wants. Although game organizers cover all production costs, the singer put up $7 million to ""make this halftime show be what he envisioned,"" his manager told Billboard.

Previous Super Bowl performers have included special guests in their show, but as befits a social-distancing year, The Weeknd didn't have any other artists join him.

COVID-19 changes

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, new health and safety guidelines are in place for the entire event. Tampa's Raymond James Stadium normally holds more than 65,000, but due to pandemic restrictions, only about 25,000 fans attended the game, including 7,500 vaccinated health care workers who've been given free tickets.

And fans are socially distanced in ""seating pods,"" People magazine reports. They'll also need to wear masks, will receive free hand sanitizer and will pay for food or souvenirs with contactless pay options.

More Super Bowl music

Though he didn't have guests during his performance, The Weeknd wasn't the only famous singer performing at the Super Bowl.

Miley Cyrus brought Billy Idol and Joan Jett on stage during an iconic pre-show. The pregame national anthem was a duet performed by Grammy nominees Jazmine Sullivan and Eric Church. Before the anthem, Grammy-winning singer H.E.R. sang America the Beautiful.

There will be still more music after the game. Verizon is hosting Big Concert for Small Business, a livestreaming musical event hosted by Tiffany Haddish and featuring artists such as Alicia Keys, Brandi Carlile, Christina Aguilera, Luke Bryan and Miley Cyrus, in addition to more from H.E.R., Jazmine Sullivan and Eric Church.

The concert will stream on Verizon's Twitter, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube channels, as well as on Yahoo, Fios and iHeartRadio, beginning after the game at 8 pm PT. Organizers are encouraging fans to make a $10 donation to support small businesses by texting SMALLBIZ to 20222.

If you watched the teaser, you'll know the theory I put forth was correct.

Ferrell teams up with fellow comedians Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina (Nora Lum) to journey to Norway in an effort to give the country a piece of his mind when it comes to the Scandinavian country's wild adoption of electric cars. Ferrell, and GM, think the US can do so much better. Over in Norway, over half of all cars sold are electric. Here in the US, that figure is just 4%, according to GM's data. Essentially, GM wants to rally the troops back home to get them pumped for a slew of new EVs coming by 2025. You'll also spy shots of the Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EV throughout -- just two of the 30 models coming, by the automaker's current count.

GM pushes the message with Ferrell's signature brand of goofy comedy that's hard not to enjoy, though the fact none of the crew actually ends up in Norway seems to sort of defeat the message a tiny bit. Nevertheless, it's a Super Bowl-appropriate chuckle that further extends the automaker's latest ""Everybody in"" marketing message. The automaker promises it's serious about putting more Americans into electric cars, and it comes on the heels of the Biden administration tossing its weight behind zero-emissions powertrains, too.

['Jackson Ryan'],https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-do-coronavirus-variants-mean-for-vaccines-and-reinfection-what-we-know/,[],"As South Africa temporarily halts the AstraZeneca vaccine​ out of concern it doesn't protect from variants, scientists are racing to understand how new variants will affect immunity.",[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,"{'spike', 'virus', 'Viruses', 'Microsoft'}","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has constantly evolved since it was first detected in humans over a year ago. Viruses replicate exceedingly fast, and each time they do, there's a small chance they mutate. This is par for the course, if you're a virus.

But in the last few weeks, scientists have been investigating SARS-CoV-2 variants with a handful of mutations arising much faster than expected. Normally, we'd expect to see one to two largely inconsequential genetic changes in the coronavirus every few months. New variants are emerging with a constellation of mutations, all at the same time.

In December 2020, the UK announced a variant of coronavirus, and two other variants were later detected in South Africa and Brazil. There is, for the time being, no reason to fear these variants or how the coronavirus is mutating -- scientists and the World Health Organization suggest that our current protective measures of social distancing and masking up work just as well against them. However, scientists are closely monitoring and evaluating them because they could worsen the pandemic if they are more transmissible or can evade our immune system and vaccines.

Epidemiologists, virologists and immunologists are now tasked with understanding how these mutations in the new variants may change the virus and how our bodies respond to them. Mutations could change SARS-CoV-2 in such a way that it may even be able to evade the immune response generated by vaccines. Preliminary research shows current vaccines should be able to deal with the three most concerning variants, but data continues to roll in. On Sunday, South Africa temporarily halted the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine after a small clinical trial found it didn't protect shot recipients from a fast-moving variant of the virus first discovered in the country.

Scientists can see the virus evolving in real time and are in a race to describe how this evolution might affect our immunity and, down the line, treatments and vaccines. Here, we're sharing everything we know about COVID-19 variants and the various esoteric ways scientists discuss mutations and evolution.

Now playing: Watch this: When will I get my COVID-19 vaccine?

How does the coronavirus mutate?

The coronavirus is an RNA virus, which means its complete genetic sequence, or genome, is a single-stranded template (humans and other mammals, by contrast, use double-stranded DNA). The template of SARS-CoV-2 is made up of four bases -- denoted by the letters a, c, u and g -- in a specific sequence, about 30,000 letters long.

The template provides instructions on how to build all the proteins that make a new coronavirus particle. To replicate, SARS-CoV-2 needs to take over a host cell and use it as a factory, hijacking the machinery within. Once it sneaks into a cell, it needs to read the RNA template.

Critical to this process is an enzyme known as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RdRp. It has one job, and it's terrible at it. ""This is an enzyme that makes a huge amount of mistakes when replicating,"" says Roger Frutos, a molecular microbiologist at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development, or CIRAD. The RdRp introduces errors during replication, producing new viruses with slightly different templates. Changes in the template are known as mutations.

Mutations often have little effect on a virus, but sometimes they change the template so much they cause changes in the virus' physical structure. ""A mutant doesn't mean it's like 10 times scarier or 10 times deadlier,"" says Tyler Starr, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. ""Mutations have incremental effects.""

This could be a bad thing for SARS-CoV-2, creating a useless zombie virus. Sometimes, it might confer an advantage, like allowing the virus to bind more tightly to a host cell or helping it evade the immune response.

Scientists and researchers spot mutations by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients, looking at the entire 30,000 letters of its genome. They compare this with the earliest viruses on record, those detected in Wuhan, China, patients back in December 2019, and see how they've changed. ""We never see viruses now that look exactly like what was in Wuhan,"" says Stuart Turville, an immunovirologist at the Kirby Institute in Australia.

If researchers see that a mutation is becoming more prevalent in a population, there's a chance it may have changed the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.

What are the coronavirus variants?

Any mutations to the coronavirus genome results in variants of the virus, but some are more concerning than others. In late 2020, three variants were identified with mutations that may make SARS-CoV-2 more transmissible or, in the case of one variant, more deadly.

The variants are described by a number of names, which makes things a little confusing, but scientists refer to them by their lineage, giving them a letter-based descriptor based on their ancestry. They are:

These will not be the last variants of SARS-CoV-2 that arise, and scientists continue to track changes in the genome. Any changes can be useful for genomic epidemiologists to assess transmission dynamics and patterns, in turn helping inform public health units to alter their response to any emerging threats. ""We are watching all the time,"" says Catherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University in Australia.

But why are these three variants of particular concern? They share common characteristics that early analysis suggests may enable them to spread more easily or evade the immune response. This seems to result from, at least partially, how these mutants change the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which enables the virus to hijack cells and turn them into factories.

Sarah Tew/CNET

How do mutations cause structural changes?

Each SARS-CoV-2 particle is covered with spikes. Infiltration of a cell requires the club-like projections to lock onto a protein on the surface of a human cell known as ACE2, which facilitates viral entry.

But the viral protrusions are also recognized by the human immune system. When immune cells detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike, they begin pumping out antibodies to prevent it from locking on to ACE2, or send other cells in to destroy the virus. Antibodies also attach to the spike and can effectively prevent it from attaching to a cell. This puts the spike under extreme evolutionary pressure. Mutations that change the spike and help it evade immune cells or antibodies or lock onto ACE2 more strongly can provide a survival advantage.

The variants listed above all share mutations in a region of the spike known as the receptor binding domain, which directly contacts ACE2. If mutations cause structural changes in the RBD, it might bind to ACE2 differently and could, for example, prevent the immune system from recognizing it as dangerous.

Interlude: Amino acids

Here's where things get a little confusing, but it's important to understand how scientists denote specific mutations and why you're seeing all these numbers and letters flying around.

Remember that each RNA genome (the template) contains four molecular bases denoted by the letters a, c, u and g. When this template is read, every three-letter combination or ""codon"" (GAU, for instance) corresponds to an amino acid. A chain of amino acids becomes a protein.

But here's the confusing bit: Amino acids are also denoted by a single-letter code, unrelated to the RNA template letters. The amino acid alanine, for instance, is A. Aspartic acid is D. Glycine is G.

Why is this important? Because scientists discuss and study coronavirus mutations at the amino acid level.

For example, we've already seen one SARS-CoV-2 variant arise and come to dominate across the world.

Sometime in early 2020, the coronavirus picked up a mutation that resulted in an increase in infectivity. A mutation in the RNA template flipped an ""a"" to a ""g,"" which caused a different amino acid to form in the RBD of the spike. This change was beneficial for the virus, and now it's the dominant form we see across the world.

The mutation is known as D614G. This notation, letter-number-letter, corresponds to a change in the amino acid at position 614, from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G).

Confusing? Definitely. Important? Absolutely. This naming convention is important to understand important mutations in the three new COVID-19 variants.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Which coronavirus mutations concern scientists most?

There are a number of mutations in all three variants across the RNA genome, but let's focus on the spike here. B.1.1.7 has eight mutations in its spike, B.1.351 has seven and P.1 has 10. Not all of these mutations are the same, but some overlap -- that is, the virus has evolved similar mutations in different locations across the world, a process known as ""convergent evolution.""

There are three mutations, all found in the RBD of the spike, which may affect the virus or how our antibodies respond to an infection:

N501Y

E484K

K417N/T

Scientists are only just beginning to understand how these individual changes may benefit SARS-CoV-2 and if they're increasing its infectivity and transmissibility or making them more prone to evading the immune response. There's emerging evidence that, alone, they may not be significant changes -- but when found in combination with other mutations, they may facilitate more worrying differences from ""original"" SARS-CoV-2.

N501Y is found in all variants and is one of the mutations scientists are most interested in.

The change from an asparagine (N) to a tyrosine (Y) has been shown to increase SARS-CoV-2's ability to bind to ACE2 and, in mice, increase its infectivity. It's currently unknown whether this one change would elicit any changes in the mortality or morbidity of COVID-19. However, the change does not seem to impact the ability for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to stimulate antibodies, according to preliminary research published on preprint server bioRxiv. That's good news.

In addition to N501Y, the B.1.351 and the P.1 variants have two more mutations: E484K and K417N/T, both of which change how sensitive the virus is to antibodies. These changes are slightly more concerning.

The two mutations are in regions of the RBD that antibodies can bind to. Researchers are concerned about E484K in particular and mutations at this site can reduce the neutralizing ability of antibodies more than 10 times. This could have the greatest impact on generating immunity, according to a preprint paper published on Jan. 4. Another preprint, published on Jan. 26, points to E484K as a key mutation in diminishing antibody activity against COVID-19. Worryingly, the mutation appears in 100% of cases infected with the P.1 variant -- and scientists are concerned it's allowing for a significant number of reinfections in Brazil.

The amino acid change at 417 is also interesting. In the South African B.1.351 variant, it's K417N. In the P.1 variant it's K417T. The amino acid change is different, but it appears to result in a similar effect -- improving evasion from antibodies. Preliminary studies reveal that position K417 is an important target of neutralizing antibodies, too, suggesting that both mutations could help the virus evade vaccine-mediated and naturally acquired immunity.

The UK government has also seen the E484K mutation in at least 43 cases, according to a recent technical briefing and the BBC.

Surveilling variants

These are merely three of the many mutations scientists are finding in the new variants -- how they all fit together in reality is much more complicated, and many more mutations that change SARS-CoV-2 are waiting to be discovered. For instance, a paper published on Jan. 28 in Cell discusses the N439K variant and its ability to evade antibodies.

Fortunately, scientists can get ahead of these variants by studying mutations that may occur in SARS-CoV-2. This is central to work performed by Starr and some of his colleagues at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. ""We've been generating these maps where we just survey all the possible mutations that could occur in the RBD,"" Starr says.

When a new variant arises, other researchers can look to these maps and see how the mutation affects the biochemical properties of the virus. Does it bind better? Worse? Is it more likely to evade the immune system? Starr explains this work has allowed for mapping how mutations might avoid treatments, like those used by Regeneron or Eli Lilly and can inform surveillance and response to emerging variants.

Should you be worried about coronavirus variants?

Presently, there's not enough evidence to suggest the variants are causing more significant mortality or more severe disease -- which means public health advice is largely unchanged. Wearing masks, social distancing and good hand and respiratory hygiene are the best way to prevent the spread of the disease. The coronavirus has not mutated to overcome these measures.

A more pressing question is how the variants and their mutations could affect vaccines and treatments and whether they'll increase the rate of reinfection. Vaccines stimulate immunity by showing the body a harmless version of the virus, which can produce antibodies that roam our inner halls looking for invaders. These antibodies may not be adept at catching and neutralizing variants, as explained above -- but researchers don't have a great handle on the data at present.

Even so, vaccine manufacturers have begun to plan for variants that negatively affect the immune response. A report in Science on Jan. 26 highlights Moderna's efforts to look ahead and potentially change the formulation of their mRNA vaccine and provide ""booster"" shots that could protect against new variants that may arise.

On Jan. 28, biotech firm Novavax released news of results from late-stage clinical trials of its own vaccine candidate. The trial was conducted on patients in both the UK and South Africa, with mixed results. In the UK, Novavax claims its vaccine had around 89.3% efficacy, but in South Africa, where the more evasive variant is circulating, this efficacy dropped to 60%. This result is concerning and makes an urgent case to evaluate our current vaccines against the newly emerged variants.

Additionally, if the variants infect someone who has previously been infected by COVID-19, there's a chance the immune system will not mount an adequate response and block infection. There's limited data on this, though the P.1 variant has been detected in a case of reinfection in Brazil. The patient was exposed to an earlier variant of SARS-CoV-2, but then acquired P.1 and scientists believe they may have gone through a second period where they were able to transmit the disease again. More work is required to fully understand this phenomenon.

Ultimately, COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe and more new infections means more opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 to evolve. The virus can't evolve without us -- indeed, it can't survive without us. The simplest way to prevent new variants from emerging is preventing the virus from spreading at all. Our efforts will need to be focused on speeding up the vaccine rollout across the globe and continuing to practice the distancing and hygiene measures we're already adept at.

Amazon Studios The Man in the High Castle imagines an alternate history where the Axis powers (Rome-Berlin-Tokyo) win World War II. Based on a Philip K. Dick novel, the series follows characters in the '60s who live in a parallel universe, where Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan control the US.

Amazon Studios The Vast of Night is a curious indie sci-fi flick from debut director Andrew Patterson that plays with narrative in clever ways.

The distinct 1950s New Mexico setting, and characters delivering monologues with the smooth intonations of those on radio, all build an eerie atmosphere with satisfying payoff.

"['Alison Denisco Rayome', 'Clifford Colby']",https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/big-stimulus-check-changes-ahead-for-dependents-what-we-know-now/,[],The third stimulus payment could change the rules for dependents and bring some families thousands of dollars more. Here are the different proposals on the table.,[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,set(),"Angela Lang/CNET

Congress is going to start hammering out the details of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal this week. While the bill -- which includes a third stimulus check for up to $1,400 -- has not yet been finalized, it does include a change to the qualifications that many have wanted: extending eligibility to dependents of all ages rather than excluding anyone over the age of 16 from counting toward the family total.

What's more, lawmakers are also considering whether dependents should be allocated the same $1,400 in stimulus check money as the per-adult maximum, according to The Washington Post. That goes for dependents who are children, young adults or older adult relatives. The potential rule change could bring in far more money for families with dependents this time around, if a new stimulus payment happens, which seems likely. The total your family could receive will also likely depend heavily on the outcome of a current debate to make the third check more ""targeted.""

We go over the new details and bring you up to speed on the stimulus check qualifications for your family, including how to receive missing stimulus money when you file your federal taxes this year and who the IRS counts as an adult for stimulus checks. This story is frequently updated.

How a third stimulus payment could change who counts as a qualified dependent: Two ways



For the first and second stimulus checks, qualified dependents were defined as anyone age 16 or under. Each dependent counted toward a flat rate in the family total, with no cap on the number of child dependents claimed. That was $500 for the first check, approved in March, and $600 for the second, which was approved and sent in December.

The latest proposal would earmark an additional $1,400 per child dependent, to be added onto the checks of their parents or guardians, according to a Washington Post report. For the first time, 17-year-olds and adult dependents (anyone 18 or older) would also be eligible for a payment as part of this plan, according to the Post. This group would include around 13.5 million college students, older adults and children of all ages with certain disabilities.

The House of Representatives is expected to begin the process of bringing a third check to a vote in two weeks.

Now playing: Watch this: Stimulus check No. 3: What you need to know

One more way the third stimulus check could change up the rules

In addition to opening up the definition of a dependent to all ages, Biden's $1,400 stimulus check proposal also seeks to include all mixed-status families. This could potentially mean that families with noncitizen parents but citizen children (who were born in the US, for example) would be eligible for stimulus money.

The second check made it possible for families with one citizen parent to receive a payment, and the first stimulus check blocked all families with one noncitizen spouse if they filed jointly, even if they claimed a US citizen dependent. The same restriction applied to a noncitizen head of household who claimed a US citizen child as part of the previous tax return. Here's what to know about citizenship and stimulus checks.

How could my dependents change my total stimulus payment?



Dependents don't receive their own stimulus checks, but they can add funds to the household's total. Children 16 years and younger who you claimed in your last tax filing added a flat rate of $600 to the household's second check. That's $100 more per dependent than in the first round of payments. The total amount of money allocated in any of the three stimulus payments would depend on your adjusted gross income, which you can also find on your taxes.

If the current proposal becomes law, a third stimulus check could add an extra $1,400 per dependent of any age to the household's total. It seems likely the new stimulus funds will be targeted to families with a certain income threshold.

Under the current proposal, individuals with incomes up to $50,000 would get the full $1,400 payment. Heads of household earning up to $75,000 would also qualify. Married couples with earnings up to $100,000 would get a $2,800 payment, according to the Washington Post. As was the case in the first and second round of checks, the more you make above that threshold, the less stimulus money you would be eligible for, for yourself and your dependents.

However, the way the stimulus check formula currently stands, the amount you get per dependent may not be as simple as adding up everyone in your household -- and that's because of that sliding scale just mentioned. Instead, dependents can actually bring some families a partial payment where they otherwise might not get any at all. Read more on that here and see for yourself with our $1,400 stimulus check calculator.

What's the difference between a dependent for your taxes and one for stimulus payments?

In terms of federal tax regulations, a dependent can fall into two categories: a qualifying child or a qualifying relative. They don't need to be children, or directly related to you, but they do have to meet certain requirements set out by the IRS.

To be claimed as a dependent on your taxes, a qualifying child must be either younger than 19 years old, or a student younger than 24 years old at the end of the calendar year. If, however, your child is what the IRS calls ""permanently and totally disabled,"" you can claim them as a dependent no matter their age.

To claim a qualifying relative -- either a child or an adult -- as a dependent, they must meet other IRS criteria. This might include an elderly relative who relies on you for care. (Find out more about what older adults need to know about stimulus checks, including those who may be qualifying relative dependents.)

Even if a dependent was claimed on your tax return, only people who meet a specific definition of ""child dependent"" were eligible to count toward the household's money from the first round of stimulus checks due to the requirements of the CARES Act. The same was true for the second round under the December $900 billion law: The child dependent must be age 16 or under as of your 2019 tax return to qualify for any payment.

However, as mentioned, the current proposal under consideration for a third check would make dependents of all ages, including young adults and older adults, eligible to add up to $1,400 each to the household's total.

Where are dependents listed on your federal tax return?

If you filed taxes in 2018 or later, you'll find your dependents listed on form 1040, US Individual Income Tax Return. In the middle of the first page, you'll see a box labeled Dependents. Dependents, along with their Social Security number, relationship to you and whether they qualify for a child tax credit or credit for other dependents, will be listed there.

IRS

What happens if you gained more dependents since your last tax return?



If a child was born or adopted into your family in 2020 and therefore not listed on your 2019 tax return, you can claim your child on your 2020 tax return to get the $500 dependent stimulus payment from the CARES Act or the $600 payment from the new bill sometime in 2021.

You can also find out if you can claim a child or another relative as your dependent on your taxes with this tool from the IRS.

What if you and your spouse share custody of a dependent, but file your taxes separately?

In this case, a child can still only be claimed as a dependent on one return in a tax year. To find out who should claim the child on their return, check out the IRS information on Qualifying Child of More Than One Person.

What if you're divorced or legally separated and you split custody of a child?

Here's where things can get confusing. A child can only be claimed as a dependent by one taxpayer for a tax year. Typically, the child counts as the dependent of the custodial parent -- the parent who the child lived with for the longer period of time during the year, even if financial support came from the other parent. However, this isn't always the case. Find out more from the IRS here.

One case that has cropped up with the first check has been parents who aren't married and have joint custody and alternate years in which they claim each dependent child (or children) on their tax returns. In that case, both parents were eligible under the CARES Act to receive $500 per child (for a total of $1,000 per child between them both).

Here's how that works: If you are a parent who didn't claim your child on your 2019 return, when you file your 2020 tax return, you may be able to claim up to an additional $500 per child on that return, if you qualify to claim the child as your qualifying dependent for 2020.

Bottom line? A parent with 50/50 custody of one or more children who didn't receive a $500 payment per child as part of the stimulus package can get that money along with their tax refund after filing 2020 taxes (in 2021), regardless of whether or not the other parent received that payment for the same children in the first round of checks. Because these payments are essentially tax credits, they don't have to be repaid to the IRS, even if both (again, not married to each other) parents end up with a check for the same children.

We don't yet know if these rules will change with a third stimulus check. (You can read our story about how stimulus checks impact child support payments here. And here's more information from the IRS about the qualifying child of more than one person.)

What about dependents with disabilities?

This is one area where the qualifications diverge for stimulus checks and taxes. If you have a child dependent with disabilities whom the IRS defines as ""permanently and totally disabled,"" they can still count as a child dependent on your tax return, regardless of their age. The IRS says your child falls under this category if both of the following apply:

""They can't engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition.""

""A doctor determines the condition has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year or can lead to death.""

The rule has been different for stimulus checks so far. Children who are disabled and aged 17 years or older are not eligible for the $600 allotted to child dependents, unless they were aged 16 or younger on your 2019 tax return. However, it appears this rule could change with a third stimulus check.

What should you do if your dependent has died?

With the first check, if a child dependent who was listed on your last tax return has since died, it's likely you were still sent the extra $500, and that they would be included in a second stimulus payment too. However, a payment made to someone who died before they received it should be returned to the IRS. You also cannot claim a stillborn child as a dependent, according to the IRS.

For more information, here are all the details we know about so far about a third stimulus check. If you still haven't gotten your first or second check, find out how to claim a missing payment and learn how to report your missing check to the IRS.",Big stimulus check changes ahead for dependents?

Apple continues to update its iOS 14 software for the iPhone ( ), adding valuable new capabilities and features. Most recently, Apple released iOS 14.4, adding a new workout to Fitness Plus for Apple Watch owners. It also included a new Unity watch face to celebrate Black History Month. The update also included a series of security fixes for vulnerabilities that were actively being exploited. Yikes.

The update follows the addition of Apple ProRaw photos to the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max. Those new features join an already impressive list of capabilities that Apple brought to its mobile devices with the release of iOS 14 in September.

For example, you can personalize your iPhone's home screen by creating custom app icons and placing new widgets wherever you want. And a new Scribble feature in the iPad update now lets you use the Apple Pencil ( ) to write in any text field, and the tablet will convert it to text, instead of always pulling up the keyboard. And that's just the beginning.

Here are the best tips and tricks we've discovered for iOS 14 and iPadOS 14. We'll frequently update this post, so check back for more fantastic tips.

1. Check out the new home screen features

The iPhone now has an app drawer-like feature called App Library, which acts as a warehouse to store all of the apps you don't regularly use. You can access the App Library by swiping from right to left on your screen past all of your current home screens. Another first for the iPhone is the ability to place widgets on the home screen. Apple provided developers with the tools to create a new style of widget that's sure to make your Android friends jealous. We go into more detail about the home screen changes here.

2. Create a custom Smart Stack widget

Speaking of widgets, you're not locked into using Apple's curated Smart Stack widget. You can create your own stack of widgets using the same technique you'd use to create an app folder. Seriously, it takes longer to decide which widgets you can include than it does to create it.

3. Make your own app icons

Apple also added new features to its Shortcuts app, with the most popular addition being the ability to create your own app icons and fully customize the look of your phone. So instead of the Apple Mail app icon, you can download an icon that replaces it with a picture of a cute cat or the Gmail icon and use that to launch the app. The process is somewhat tedious, but if you want a home screen that's unlike any other, it's well worth your time.

4. Use apps without installing them, thanks to App Clips

Think of App Clips as miniature apps that only show you a portion of what the full app can do. For example, a Yelp App Clip could show you business hours and the menu for a specific restaurant and nothing more. Want to try one? Open the Apple Maps app on your iPhone, search for Panera Bread, tap on a location and then select Order Food. Pretty cool, right? After using an App Clip, you can access it again in the App Library in the recently added folder.

5. iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max can take raw photos

This is surely a feature for photography buffs, but one that will hopefully pique the curiosity of those who are looking to get a bit more out of their iPhone camera. The release of iOS 14.3 adds Apple's ProRaw photo format, which allows you to take photos using the ""raw"" photography format, and make changes to it without any image degradation, as is the case when the photo is converted to a JPG (the standard for Apple's camera app).

6. Work out at home with Fitness Plus

With gyms closed or running at limited capacity, now's the time to work out at home. Apple's Fitness Plus service is built directly into your iPhone, iPad ( ) and Apple TV ( ), and it uses your Apple Watch to track your workout.

7. Time to take a walk



Speaking of Fitness Plus, iOS 14.4 and WatchOS 7.3 added a new workout called Time to Walk. Apple has enlisted celebrities who go on a virtual walk with you, telling stories that are meant to be inspiring, intertwined with personal music choices. You'll need to install updates on your watch and phone before you can use it. Here's how to set up and use the new workout.

8. Picture-in-Picture comes to the iPhone

You're no longer forced to decide whether you want to watch a Twitch stream or browse Reddit on your iPhone. With iOS 14, you can do both at the same time now that Apple has added picture-in-picture mode to the iPhone. The iPad has had this feature for a couple of years now, so it's nice to see the iPhone get it as well. When you start watching a video you only need to leave the app and go back to the home screen to trigger PiP. There are some apps, like YouTube, that don't support the feature. You can view a list of all the apps installed on your phone that support it by going to Settings > General > Picture in Picture. Read more about picture-in-picture to get a better idea of when and where it works.

9. Deleting apps can be confusing now

With the addition of the App Library, there's now an extra step when it comes to deleting an app from your phone and for long-time iPhone users, it's not at all straightforward. But it doesn't have to be too confusing; we walk you through the new steps.

10. Ditch Apple Mail and Safari

Apple added the ability to delete its own apps from your iPhone a few years ago, but you still couldn't set apps like Gmail or Outlook as your default email app. Now you can, but Apple has limited this new feature to only the email and web browsers. It only takes a few taps to make the change, after which you won't have to deal with Apple's apps ever again.

11. AirPods Pro has a new audio feature

The iPhone and iPad aren't the only devices that received a big update. Apple's AirPods Pro also got a small firmware update that added a new feature called Spatial Audio. You'll, of course, need to use an iPhone or iPad running iOS 14 to use the feature. With both devices updated, whenever you're watching a video the sound will follow the movements of your head, adjusting with each twist and turn. CNET's David Carnoy described it as an ""out-of-bud experience."" And he's not wrong.

12. The iPad looks more like a Mac than ever

iPadOS 14 includes several new features and enhancements that bring its interface closer to looking and working like a Mac. Or is it the Mac that's starting to look like an iPad with MacOS Big Sur? Either way, you'll want to learn all you can about the new iPad features in iPadOS 14.

Jason Cipriani/CNET

13. Hidden features are the best features

Not to be left out, there are several hidden features in iOS 14 that do some truly amazing things. For instance, a new back tap feature lets you tap on the back of your phone two or three times, triggering a task like taking a screenshot or launching an app. We've found a total of nine hidden features worth sharing with you so far and plan to keep adding to the list.

14. New privacy features

Keeping your information private is one of Apple's main marketing points, and iOS 14 is going even further to help keep your information private. There are new location sharing settings that will limit whether an app sees your exact location or a more general area. There's also a new notification dot that will tell you when an app is using your phone's camera or mic, and finer controls over which photos an app has access to. Check out all of the new privacy features and how to use them.

15. New camera tricks

There are several subtle but important new features in the Camera app. For example, when taking a photo at night, there's a new guide to remind you to keep still. You'll see crosshairs that show you where to keep the camera. There's also a new exposure adjustment dial, and you can snap multiple photos much quicker. Learn how to use and where to find the new features, complete with animated images.

16. Up your selfie game

Another new feature in the Camera app is a new setting for the front-facing camera that is sure to help your selfies shine. The new mirror mode forces the camera to act more like a, well, mirror, which can make it easier to make sure your shot is framed and lined up the way you want. We show you where to find the new setting.

17. Still want more? We gotcha

As a bonus round, we've compiled a few more tips to do even more, like tag someone in a group conversation in the Messages app and use Apple's new Translate app to carry a conversation in two completely different languages. We walk you through those two tips, plus a few more of our favorite features.

WandaVision just got a little Wonder Woman 1984, dragging the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to the '80s as its fifth episode landed Friday on We pick up after Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) gave birth to twin sons Billy and Tommy (following a ludicrously short pregnancy) and the true nature of Westview was seemingly revealed.

""It's Wanda. It's all Wanda,"" says SWORD agent Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) after being kicked out of the New Jersey town. It seems the Avenger has turned the whole town into a shifting period sitcom, and wasn't happy when Monica tried to give her a dose of reality.

Let's put on our fashionable leg warmers, toss back our shiny mullets and dive into the episode. SPOILERS comin'.

Marvel Studios

Brother from another Marvel

The episode ends with the arrival of Wanda's brother, Pietro (aka Quicksilver), whom we last saw played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Avengers: Age of Ultron… in the MCU. He was killed by Ultron in that movie, a source of major trauma for Wanda.

""She recast Pietro?"" asks astrophysicist Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) upon seeing him.

The Pietro who arrives at the door in this episode is played by Evan Peters, whom you might remember as the version of the character in the last few X-Men movies -- Days of Future Past, Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix. These weren't set in the MCU, since 21st Century Fox had the cinematic rights to the X-Men characters.

However, Quicksilver and Wanda were major Avengers characters too, so Fox and Marvel Studios came to an arrangement that'd let them use their own version of the characters in their cinematic universes. That became irrelevant when Marvel Studios parent Disney acquired Fox (and the X-Men cinematic rights) in 2019, and it seemed like the Peters version of the character would fade with the Fox X-Men universe.

""Long-lost bro get to squeeze his stinkin' sister to death or what?"" Pietro says to a shocked Wanda.

She may have been trying to undo her brother's death and accidentally brought the X-Men's Pietro into the MCU. We already knew the X-Men were going to appear in this universe in some form, but a reboot seemed the most likely entry point -- I certainly didn't dare hope we'd see any of the OG cinematic X-Men again (even though Dark Phoenix included a fun MCU Easter egg).

It's unclear exactly what his appearance means for this universe -- it could be the beginnings of the multiverse, a limited crossover, or we might see a bunch of characters from the X-Men universe show up (Hugh Jackman Wolverine and Michael Fassbender Magneto next please). The Deadpool movies are ostensibly set in that universe as well -- Peters had a cameo in 2018's Deadpool 2 -- and Deadpool 3 is confirmed to be part of the MCU.

It also opens up the possibility that the J. Jonah Jameson we saw in the Spider-Man: Far From Home postcredits scene is the one from Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy.

Your move, DC.

Them rascally boys

We open with Wanda and Vision (Paul Bettany) stressing out over their crying twin sons Billy and Tommy. Wanda tries to make them sleep with a spell, but it seems she can't influence them the same way she can most of the others in Westview.

""Why won't you do what I want?"" she wonders.

Enter the neighborly Agnes (Kathryn Hahn), in her spectacular Jazzercise outfit, who volunteers to help with the crying babies. Vision resists the idea, and we get a weird moment.

""Should we just take it from the top?"" Agnes asks Wanda, briefly breaking character and the illusion to reveal that she knows about Wanda's ability to rewind events that displease her.

The babies stop crying for that moment, and kick off again when Agnes returns to her role. She's not under Wanda's spell, and seems to be playing along voluntarily. The boys also age up twice -- first from babies to five, then to 10 -- while Agnes is present.

""Kids, ha. You can't control 'em. No matter how hard you try,"" she says, apparently cool with the weirdness. Could Agnes have tried to control Wanda at some point? Is Westview a result of some deal they made? It's possible Agnes is the puppet master here, and wants the boys to age up for her own purposes.

Billy and Tommy later resist Wanda's direct control, by rebuffing her assertion that it's Monday, and push her to remember her lost brother Pietro.

""He's far away from here, and that makes me sad sometimes,"" she responds -- perhaps our first hint that she knows there's another version of her brother in a different reality.

Woof

The boys also find a dog in the garden and name him Sparky, at Agnes' prompting. Agnes later finds Sparky dead, having seemingly eaten leaves, and Wanda refuses to resurrect the pup.

Did Wanda consciously or subconsciously kill Sparky, mirroring her own sense of loss over Vision in Billy and Tommy? Or could Agnes be the one doing it, to shape them in some way?

Marvel Studios

Trouble in paradise

Vision is increasingly aware that Westview ain't right, and confronts Wanda directly about it. He wonders why there are no other kids in Westview, highlighting one of the town's creepiest attributes. Where could Wanda, Agnes or whoever is really in control have put them? Maybe they're just in a lovely summer camp, having the time of their lives. Yes, let's go with that.

Her ability to influence Vision is waning too -- she even tries to end the ""episode"" by rolling the credits on him -- but Pietro's arrival provides the perfect distraction.

We don't know if Pietro was summoned by Wanda, the twins, Agnes or some unseen force.

The ad

The commercial break in this episode presents us with Lagos paper towels -- ""For when you make a mess you didn't mean to."" This is reference to the incident in Lagos, Nigeria, in Captain America: Civil War.

Here's what happened: The Avengers stopped terrorist (and former Hydra sleeper agent) Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon, and Rumlow blew himself up in attempting to kill Cap. Wanda used her telekinetic powers to fling him high in the air, but this accidentally killed a bunch of Wakandan humanitarian workers -- creating further controversy around the Avengers and indirectly resulting in Wanda and Vision getting into a relationship.

Marvel Studios/Screenshot by Sean Keane/CNET

In the ad, we hear a continued dripping sound after the mess is wiped away, suggesting it's not really cleaned up. It feels like a hint that Wanda can't just magic away everything she doesn't like.

Hero or villain?

Outside Westview, FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) runs through Wanda's history for the SWORD (Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division) agents -- she was born in 1989 to Irina and Oleg Maximoff. This show is set in 2023, so Wanda is 34, and it's likely Irina and Oleg are the people seen in the commercials.

We also learn that this all kicked off nine days ago, when Wanda broke into SWORD headquarters and stole Vision's corpse (what were they doing with him?). She also defied Vision's wishes by resurrecting him.

""He didn't want to be anybody's weapon,"" says Jimmy.

Marvel Studios

Acting SWORD director Tyler Hayward (Josh Stamberg) seems eager to cast Wanda as a terrorist (rewriting reality in his own way) for taking control of Westview and for past links with Hydra, much to Darcy's and Jimmy's chagrin.

He highlights Monica's description of how being under Wanda's influence felt -- ""excruciating, terrifying, a violation"" -- making it hard to argue with him.

Steppin' out

When Wanda steps out of Westview to confront the SWORD agents for sending a drone in, she's wearing her Avengers: Endgame outfit and speaks in her Sokovian accent. Monica tries to appeal to her, to no avail.

""I have what I want, and no one will ever take it from me again,"" she says.

With an awesome flick of her wrist, she makes the armed agents aim at Hayward. The fact that they don't fire suggests she hasn't gone full bad guy.

Observations and WTF questions

Vision mentions Charles Darwin's , an 1871 book in which the naturalist details his theories of evolution and the dominant role of women in mate choice. That notion might seem a bit old-school now, but Wanda did resurrect Vision to start a family.

Could Vision's decision to read be linked to his sense that Wanda is controlling him?

The intro pays homage to '80s sitcoms Growing Pains, Family Ties and Full House, the third of which saw the debut of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen -- Elizabeth Olsen's older sisters.

Darcy calls the anomaly ""the Hex,"" after the hexagonal shape of the affected area.

Hayward also wonders if Wanda has an alias or ""funny nickname,"" but Jimmy rebuffs that. In the comics, she's known as Scarlet Witch, but that name hasn't been used in the MCU.

Sparky is the name of the synthezoid dog created by Vision in the .

Monica didn't seem eager to talk about Captain Marvel. Since Carol Danvers and her mom were friends in the '90s-set Captain Marvel movie

""I know an aerospace engineer who'd be up for this challenge."" Monica wants to create a vessel that'll get her into Westview safely, and contacts someone who sounds quite like Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic. We know the Fantastic Four

Alternatively, she could have texted Riri Wiliams, aka Ironheart, who has a similar skillset. She hasn't been introduced to the MCU, but is getting her own Disney Plus show Dominique Thorne).

Dominique Thorne). What exactly happened when the drone fired? The transmission and broadcast cut out, then Wanda steps out of the Hex.

Wanda seems eager to ""go to sleep"" -- could the effort of maintaining the Hex be tiring her out, is it just an effort to escape, or does going to bed ""reset"" everything?

When Vision briefly frees Norm of Wanda's influence, he immediately thinks about his sick dad. Monica also sees her late mother when she's freed, suggesting Wanda's influence papers over grief.

Join us for more Easter eggs and observations next Friday, when episode 6 of WandaVision hits Disney Plus.

['Mark Serrels'],https://www.cnet.com/news/dogecoin-the-meme-that-somehow-became-a-real-cryptocurrency/,[],"It was supposed to be a joke, but within months it was one of the world's most highly valued cryptocurrencies.",[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,"{'Microsoft', 'Nintendo', 'Bitcoin', 'IBM', 'Reddit', 'bitcoin'}","It is June 22, 2014. Jackson Palmer, a self-identified ""average geek,"" is high in the stands at a Nascar race at the Sonoma Raceway in California. He is an Australian man in his 20s. He has zero interest in racing. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine it would come to this.

He surveys the scene.

Below him: a tremendous crowd. The overwhelming blare of engines. Hurtling round at tremendous speeds: the #98 Moonrocket, a high-performance racing car. No different from the other cars on the track, except for one crucial detail.

On the bonnet of the car: a dog. A Shiba Inu, more commonly known as a ""Shibe,"" the dog made famous in the Doge meme that was popular in 2013.

Emblazoned on top: the word ""DOGECOIN"" in all caps. Below: ""digital currency"".

Palmer describes the situation using words like ""crazy,"" ""surreal"" and ""nuts."" He remembers this moment as a ""reality check."" Dogecoin was a tweet, then it was a cryptocurrency worth money in the real world. Six months later, he watched as a joke that he'd made in passing somehow manifested itself into something tangible. A Dogecar in full flight.

It reminded Palmer how insane the world could be.

This is the story of Dogecoin, the joke that became too real for its own good.

The next big thing

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin, enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is the original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with the potential to transform how money works in the 21st century.

Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it.

""It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,"" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Technology in Sydney.

At one point Dogecoin was worth $2 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that.

""Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,"" Lee said. ""I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early.



""And also the dog.""

If you've spent any time on the internet during the last decade, you've probably heard of the Doge meme. The iconic Shibe, his inner monologue expressed in comic sans with broken modifiers: ""so scare,"" ""much noble,"" ""wow.""

Now playing: Watch this: Dogecoin explained: The joke cryptocurrency worth serious...

At the peak of the meme's popularity near the tail end of 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer for one of the world's largest tech companies, made a joke combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. It was a joke taking aim at the bizarre world of crypto and bitcoin's multiple derivatives.

""Investing in Dogecoin,"" Palmer tweeted, ""pretty sure it's the next big thing.""

The tweet got a lot of attention.

For laughs, Palmer decided to keep the joke going. He bought the Dogecoin.com domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin.

He left a note on the site: If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch.

Nintendo

The bell tolls



On the other side of the world, Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM, saw Palmer's note. He'd just finished ""Bells"", a project he was working on in his spare time.

Bells was a cryptocurrency named after money used in the Nintendo game Animal Crossing. It was 2013, the original crypto gold rush. Markus saw that bitcoin's code was open-source. He decided to take a weekend and do something weird. He tried to create his own cryptocurrency for ""sillies,"" as he put it.

Bells was weird as hell. The major difference between Bells and regular cryptocurrencies was the rewards: they were completely random. If you mined bitcoin, using a decently powerful home computer, the rewards were consistent.

If you mined Bells, there was no telling whether the reward would be one Bell or 500 Bells.

And that's because Bells wasn't meant to be serious, it was a digital currency based on a video game about animals who live in a village and go fishing together.

The cryptocurrency community didn't really get the joke.

""People were just trashing it,"" laughs Markus, who quickly discovered there was very little crossover between crypto-obsessives and gamers.

""I was like alright, I retire,"" says Markus. ""I don't need to do this anymore.""

But then Markus read Palmer's message on Dogecoin.com. That was the moment Billy Markus decided to come out of crypto retirement.

Ctrl+F bitcoin



When Palmer didn't immediately respond to Markus' offer to help build Dogecoin, he started working on it anyway.

""Dogecoin,"" says Markus, ""from 'that seems like it's funny' to actually doing it, took about three hours. It's almost trivial to create a new cryptocurrency.""

It was a find-and-replace job.

Ctrl+F 'Bitcoin,' replace with 'Dogecoin.'

Markus freely admits to finding large chunks of bitcoin's source code completely incomprehensible, but knew enough to change a few core elements for Dogecoin. For example, Markus created 100 billion dogecoins (as opposed to bitcoin's 21 million) and made them easier to mine. (Dogecoin is already close to being mined out, while bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140.)

He changed the font (to comic sans of course) and changed every mention of the word 'mine' to 'dig' (because dogs don't mine, they dig...).

And then, during his lunch break, Markus set Dogecoin live.

Moving at light speed

Premining: the act of gathering cryptocurrency before launching your coin into the public domain. Almost everyone serious about launching a cryptocurrency does this.

But Markus and Palmer didn't premine any Dogecoin. Because they weren't serious about launching a cryptocurrency.

""We thought it was this big joke that would die off,"" laughs Palmer.

And according to Markus, Palmer wasn't even sure how to mine a cryptocurrency.

Markus had a relatively powerful gaming PC, with two graphics cards, so he was officially the first person to mine Dogecoin. But given the the nature of mining (which gets increasingly difficult as the currency is mined) Billy's computer was no longer powerful enough to mine Dogecoin after about five minutes. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer and that was that. Both got about $5,000 of Dogecoin.

And that's all the Dogecoin either man would ever own.

In online crypto circles, Dogecoin became popular very quickly. Forum threads moved rapidly. The name Dogecoin echoed throughout dark corners of the internet.

But Reddit was almost certainly the main driver in Dogecoin's rapid rise to crypto stardom. The Dogecoin subreddit exploded almost immediately, and with that explosion came the infrastructure any cryptocurrency needs if it is to become successful: mining pools, services.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

""It was moving at light speed,"" explains Markus. ""Within minutes we were like, 'Wow, this is way out of our control.""

But it was the Reddit ""tipping bot"" that drove Dogecoin into the stratosphere.

If a user posted something to the effect of, ""hey 'dogebot' tip this person five dogecoin,"" that Reddit user would automatically receive five Dogecoin. People were sending Dogecoin back and forth in a feel-good exercise that cost very little money in real-world terms.

""I liked it,"" says Markus. ""At the time, Dogecoin wasn't worth anything, but getting five Dogecoin felt better than getting two cents.""

Reddit users were sharing Dogecoin back and forth constantly, which expanded the user base of Dogecoin and, as a result, increased its value as a cryptocurrency.

""Pretty much everyone who used Reddit had Dogecoin,"" says Palmer. ""I think that was key to its success.""

A force for good



January 2014. Jackson Palmer is already three drinks deep at a trivia night at his local pub in Sydney. His phone starts buzzing. It doesn't stop buzzing.

Earlier that night, Palmer and the Dogecoin community had brainstormed a ridiculous (but completely brilliant) idea.

For the first time in a decade, Jamaica's bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but it didn't have enough money to attend. As huge fans of the comedy ""Cool Runnings,"" Palmer and the Dogecoin crew decided to do something about it.

They chucked up a Dogecoin address onto the subreddit and asked for donations. Hours later they'd raised $25,000.

That's when Palmer's phone started vibrating off the hook.

""I was like, 'Quick we need to get back to our computers,'"" laughs Palmer.

So Palmer and friends stumbled home from the pub, picked up a six-pack of beer for good measure and set about figuring out how to send 26 million Dogecoins to the Jamaican bobsled team.

It was a gesture that symbolized the early spirit of Dogecoin.

In Markus' words, they were allergic to the word ""invest."" Both Palmer and Markus donated all their Dogecoin to these massive charity initiatives. They helped build water wells in Kenya and raised money to help train assistance dogs for autistic children.

""We wanted to create something that was a force for good,"" explains Palmer.

But as the community grew, the initial spirit in which Dogecoin was launched was difficult to preserve. People started to care about the price of Dogecoin. They were literally and figuratively invested in it.

And that terrified Markus.

""I don't mind if someone spends ten bucks and gets some Dogecoin,"" says Markus. ""It's like buying a movie ticket or something, that's fun.



""But when someone puts $20,000 in? That makes me really, really uncomfortable.""

Markus began clashing with members of the community. For him, Dogecoin was still crypto ""for sillies,"" but here it was ballooning into a currency people were trading for real money. In his view Dogecoin was a silly thing that should remain silly. Many in the community disagreed.

Eventually he decided enough was enough.

""I was like, ""Okay, this is dumb. I don't want to be the leader of a cult.""""

Markus decided to bail on Dogecoin.

Moolah

It was Moolah that pushed Dogecoin to the brink.

Palmer describes it as ""PayPal for cryptocurrency."" From the very beginning, Palmer was cynical.

Run by a British man calling himself Alex Green, Moolah was a cryptocurrency exchange designed to help people buy and sell Dogecoin. They infiltrated the Dogecoin community with startling efficiency.

Alex Green began by doling out Dogecoin in exchange for upvotes on the Dogecoin subreddit. He also donated generously to charitable causes the community were involved in, like $2,500 to a cancer charity, or $3,000 to help get the Dogecoin Nascar vehicle on the track.

The community loved it. Soon Moolah began hiring people from the Dogecoin community for key positions in the company.



""Alex Green started building his business on top of Dogecoin,"" says Palmer.

Markus, watching from afar, wasn't a fan.

Now playing: Watch this: Cryptojacking: The hot new hacker trick for easy money

Despite removing himself from the day-to-day workings of Dogecoin, Markus attended a Dogecoin convention, organized in part by Palmer. He wanted to catch up with some of the old gang. By chance, he ran into representatives from Moolah, who were at the bar guzzling Cristal at $200 a bottle. They poured a glass for Markus.

""I was really uncomfortable,"" remembers Markus. ""I said, 'whatever's going on here I just don't want any part of it.'""

""I just passed the glass to someone else.""

Many key figures in the Dogecoin community shared Markus' suspicions, particularly Palmer, who was wary of Moolah from the beginning. But when concerns were raised they were mostly shouted down by a community that enjoyed the free currency being sent their way.

Later Moolah began soliciting the Dogecoin community for investment dollars and plenty donated Dogecoin to the cause. Why not? Moolah had been generous in the past. It made sense to repay the favor.

Moolah received over $300,000 from the Dogecoin community, across three separate rounds of investment.

And then it all came crashing down.

Months later, October 2014, Moolah went completely bankrupt. The Dogecoin community would end up losing every single cent they'd invested.

The situation got worse. An ex-girlfriend of Green got in contact with Palmer and other members of the Dogecoin community. She revealed that Green was actually Ryan Kennedy, who was notorious in the UK anime community for running companies terrifyingly similar to Moolah.

Suddenly the UK police were involved. After a three-year investigation, Kennedy faces multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. At a preliminary hearing in Bristol Crown Court on September 2017 he denied all charges. A request for comment was sent to Kennedy's Defence Lawyer, but we've yet to receive a response.

But Kennedy had to answer to more serious, disturbing crimes. In May 2016, he was tried and convicted on three counts of rape with three separate women. According to press reports he smiled as he was being led from court.

""Ryan Kennedy convinced his victims they had no choice but to do as they were told,"" said senior prosecutor Ben Samples. ""He was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive, putting his needs above all else.""

Ryan Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a UK prison.

Remember this moment

In the months after Moolah's bankruptcy, Palmer struggled. He distanced himself from Dogecoin. From the community. From cryptocurrency as a whole.

""The energy I was putting into it wasn't helping me from a mental health perspective,"" he explains.

Dogecoin

Like Markus, Palmer decided to bail on Dogecoin.

Palmer has re-emerged on the cryptocurrency scene. He now runs his own YouTube channel. He has no interest in launching another cryptocurrency and has little to do with Dogecoin. He calls himself a crypto skeptic. ""Cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem,"" he says.

What problem did Dogecoin solve?

""I don't think it solves anything,"" he says. ""If anything, it exists as an educational tool. It's a reminder that we can't take this stuff seriously.

""I hope people see Dogecoin and say, I'm not going to put all my money into this. Because right now there's a dog on a coin and it's worth half a billion dollars.""

Outside of the occasional donation, neither Palmer or Markus owns any significant amount of Dogecoin.

Back in January 2014, Markus posted a message on the Dogecoin subreddit; an ode to the community and what it had achieved. One year later, in the wake of the Moolah disaster, it had been reposted. An attempt to recapture the spirit in which Dogecoin had been founded.

It was a timely reminder of what had been lost.

""I have no way of knowing how transient this all may be,"" Markus wrote of Dogecoin, two months after creating it.

He wrote about how proud he was -- of the community, of the money they'd raised for various good causes. He thanked everyone for the incredible amount of work they'd put in.

""I would like everyone to remember this moment,"" he said. ""My hope is that Dogecoin will always be remembered fondly.""","Dogecoin: Cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but kind of a joke"

It seemed safe. Adam had investigated the coin's development team on LinkedIn, and watched a video of its CEO laying out a roadmap for the coin's future. A newswire piece published on Yahoo touted DeTrade's technology as advanced enough to disrupt cryptocurrency.

Thanks to Bitcoin hitting an all-time high valuation of $40,000, almost tripling its value in two months, cryptocurrency is very much back in the zeitgeist. But while for many people Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency, it's not what crypto traders like Adam are interested in. Beneath Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-best-known currency, is a strange underworld of different cryptocurrencies.

Called altcoins or, sometimes, ""shitcoins,"" these are essentially penny-stock cryptocurrencies. And they're crazy. Bitcoin tripled its value recently, but many altcoins explode 30, 40 or 50 times over within days. Arguably the most famous is Dogecoin, which recently shot up thanks to a potent combination of Reddit and Elon Musk, but there are thousands of altcoins, forming an Indiana Jones-esque Cave of Crypto Wonders. The spoils can be life-changing, but there are traps around each corner. Fortunes can be made and lost in seconds. Cons and fraudsters are everywhere, with traders vulnerable to scams at each step of the process.

Case in point: Adam's foray into DeTrade. The touted technology behind it wasn't real. Nothing about the project was. DeTrade, for all intents and purposes, didn't exist. The LinkedIn profiles were fake, and the video of its CEO was a deepfake created with AI. It was a scam. Those behind it, operating in the unregulated world of crypto, vanished. Adam lost his $2,500, but he got off easy. In total, those behind the scam took in around $2 million.

Just a regular day playing with altcoins, says Adam.

Million-dollar joke

Adam got into cryptocurrency in September. When we spoke, it felt like he'd crammed years of trading into two months. He put in $4,000 and lost it in days. Then he turned $3,000 into $90,000. After withdrawing a third of that and then losing just over another third, he now had around $20,000 in crypto.

Adam had seen some tempestuous trading in recent weeks. One person managed to flip $2,000 into over $40,000 on two different occasions, but lost it all to scams both times. Another put $150 in a coin and doubled his money in 15 minutes. Decent result, but his $150 would've turned into $28,000 if he'd waited only one more day.

But despite the community's enthusiasm, there's a small problem. Right now cryptocurrencies don't really do anything.

Bitcoin nearly tripled in price, from $15,000 to over $40,000, in two months. If you invested $1,000 in early November, you could have taken out $2,600 two months later. Coin Desk

Investing in a stock means ascertaining its value -- based on factors like competition, risks and, above all, profit generation -- and then putting money into ones that are undervalued. If other investors follow you, the stock rises, giving you an opportunity to take profit.

Speculation is naturally part of this: The Dot-com Bubble was all about pouring money into ""pre-profit"" companies in the hopes they'd make money someday. Cryptocurrency, however, takes speculation into the stratosphere. For the most part, cryptocurrency is pure speculation. People are investing in technology that produces nothing, and has no practical application. As I write this, a coin called Meme is selling for $517. That's a little over four times the price of an Apple share. Doge, a coin marketed after the internet slang for ""dog,"" doubled in value earlier this month after a pornstar tweeted about it. After the price settled, it then rocketed once more when Reddit wanted to make it the GameStop of cryptocurrency.

This disconnect between price and purpose has made many experts understandably skeptical.

David Gerard is one such skeptic. He became interested in Bitcoin in 2013, when it first hit $1,000, and has since written two books on cryptocurrency. His most recent focuses on Libra, Facebook's ill-fated attempt at digital currency.

""The driving force of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is nothing to do with technology,"" he told me during a Skype call. ""It's all about the chance that people might get rich for free. All of this is about the psychology of get-rich-quick schemes.""

In his years working as an IT systems administrator, Gerard's job has been to examine new technology and discern what's useful and what's not. Cryptocurrency, he told me, is not.

""Bitcoin burns a whole country's worth of electricity for the most inefficient payment network in human history,"" he said.

After launching at around $8 in August, the obscure Meme coin briefly reached a valuation of over $1,750 in September. If, with fantastic luck, you invested $1,000 at $8 and sold at $1,750, you'd be up $217,000. This is the allure of ""shitcoins."" Dextools

That's no exaggeration. Cryptocurrencies are mined using powerful computers, and many enterprising types put together farms of computers used solely for the purpose of mining Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin is responsible for more energy consumption than Switzerland.

Gerard says the only thing you can do with Bitcoin is buy it and sell it. He's even harsher on altcoins.

""They're absolutely useless objects. Even by the standards of Bitcoin, altcoins are useless,"" he said.

This is precisely what makes them so fascinating. Seemingly, all they can do is get internet punters to bet on their success. But this enables average people to become rich. That Meme coin I mentioned before? It was listed at $2.72 and a month later hit an all-time-high price of over $2,000.

Imagine becoming a millionaire from a joke internet coin.

Risk and reward

Crypto Spider has made millions with altcoins. Crypto Spider isn't his real name. Like most people in the cryptocurrency community, he goes by a pseudonym.

He's gained renown in some Telegram groups over the past few months thanks to a ""2K to 1M"" challenge, where he endeavored to see how quickly, and with how few trades, he could turn the first number into the second. In cryptocurrency, you can follow someone's portfolio if you have their wallet number, so the community was able to watch this challenge play out in real time.

Within two months, that $2,000 had grown to over $2 million. Much of that money was made off one trade: He chucked $50,000 into a project which, in the space of around a week, magnified 35 times in value, netting him $1.75 million. After passing $2 million, he cashed out.

""You won't ever see that type of explosive growth if you don't trade in altcoins,"" he told me, though he also said ""95% of these coins are going to be nonexistent in the future.""

Like Adam, Crypto Spider has no background in finance or trading. He lists college courses in game theory, basic algorithmics and some economics as useful to his crypto exploits -- but in essence he's a self-taught amateur. He declined to tell me his specific age, only that he was ""20ish"" when he first got into cryptocurrency in 2017.

He admits he was attracted by the ""pretty numbers,"" by seeing coins magnify in value 30, 40 and 50 times within a short period. He was enthusiastic enough to start a university club around cryptocurrencies, and how they'd be used in the future.

Crypto Spider says cryptocurrency will play a ""major part in the future of finance,"" and speaks with the passion of a believer. He breathlessly transitions from how cryptocurrency is a part of the internet's evolution to the possible use cases of blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, in the next 10 years. But despite his enthusiasm, I couldn't help but notice how chunks of what he said echoed Gerard.

Cryptocurrencies are mined using powerful computers. More emissions are produced by global Bitcoin miners than by the entire country of Switzerland. Washington Post

For one thing, he looks back at all the projects he was excited about in 2017 and realizes most were almost entirely vaporware, technology that's advertised but never delivered.

Gerard calls the cryptocurrency community a pool of scammers. Spider notes that people often invest in altcoins they know don't have a function, because there's enough hype around the project to make money. ""It's a bubble,"" he said, ""we're literally swapping money from each other. I somehow was able to game all the other people.""

Spider says his performance is 60% luck. He first approached cryptocurrnecy trading with the mentality of, ""I'm young, I'm dumb, I can lose all my money and it'll be OK.""

Again, it reminded me of something Gerard said: ""If you're rich enough that your money is your own problem, fine. If you know zero is a number your investment could go to, fine.""

""But a lot of people are being ripped off, and that's really bad.""

Trapdoors

People really are getting ripped off. Difficult to regulate and subsisting largely on hype, cryptocurrencies are particularly prone to scams.

Take OneCoin, a company that, through a presale for a cryptocurrency that didn't exist, stole $4 billion from people around the world before its founder disappeared. Then there's BitConnect, a coin that reached a $2.6 billion valuation by promising a 1% return on investment every day. It was eventually designated a Ponzi scheme by various authorities around the globe, causing it to lose 96% of its value before getting shut down months later.

Those are two of the biggest instances of crypto-fraud. But millions of dollars are scammed from cryptocurrency markets every day in less dramatic ways. Coins are suddenly discontinued, with owners taking all the money with them in what the community calls ""rug pulls."" Some have investment contracts, ignored like terms-of-service agreements, that prohibit you from taking your money out of a project. Other times, entire cryptocurrency exchanges -- which sell coins like a stock exchange sells stocks -- vanish.

""I think I've been scammed over 100 times,"" Crypto Spider said, adding that he lost $250,000 through fraud in December. ""Who knows who creates these projects. A lot of people are taking on pseudonyms, because they're almost all money grabs.""

But the deepfake used to scam $2 million adds a new vector. Coming into wider use in recent years, deepfakes are mostly used for pornographic purposes, but as the DeTrade scam shows, deepfakes can also be used in financial scams.

OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova at an event for the ""revolutionary"" cryptocurrency. Ignatova disappeared around the time OneCoin was discovered to be a fraud: The cryptocurrency the company sold didn't actually exist. It's reported to have scammed over $4 billion from people around the world. Ignatova has yet to be found. OneCoin

Gerard says he's never seen a deepfake used as part of a scam before. Crypto Spider says he's seen it just once.

""We didn't have that problem in 2017, where people would use deepfakes and rug pull like this,"" he said. ""The internet is evolving, but the scammers are also evolving.""

Deepfake technology ""is being democratized, and that may not be a good thing,"" said Julie Inman-Grant. Now commissioner of the Australian government's eSafety Commission, Inman-Grant formerly led public policy teams at Microsoft, Adobe and Twitter.

""This kind of takes the art out of social engineering,"" she explained, referring to the techniques usually used by scammers to get you to click a fraudulent link or hand over credit card details. ""If they're delivering a video of someone you respect and you really have no way of telling by the naked eye or ear if it's fake or not, the potential for misuse could be devastating.""

Ironically, it's blockchain, the behind-the-scenes technology, that could be the solution to the burgeoning deepfake problem. In cryptocurrency, the blockchain is an unalterable ledger that tracks every transaction. Once it's on the ledger, it can't be altered. That same technology can be used to track anything -- like the creation and distribution of a video, from studio to iPhone screen. There are already startups working toward this, like Truepic.

When I asked about blockchain's ability to neutralize deepfakes, Inman-Grant wasn't entirely optimistic.

""It's definitely an arms race, but it's not an arms race we're winning right now.""

Real or regulated?

When Bitcoin hit $40,000 in December, it was confirmation to enthusiasts that cryptocurrency is the future. For skeptics, a higher peak just means a more precipitous fall.

""I think they'll become increasingly regulated and less and less interesting,"" Gerard said of cryptocurrency. That means less of the ""pretty numbers"" Crypto Spider was attracted to, but hopefully fewer scams.

For Adam, DeTrade actually had a happy ending. One aggrieved victim of the scam analyzed the metadata of the deepfake, which he used to track down the perpetrators. After some naming and shaming across Telegram, the money was returned.

That unexpected $2,500 return was a big deal, equivalent to a few weeks pay. Good timing too: By the time Adam got it, a bad trade saw his crypto portfolio diminish from $10,000 to $2,000.

Just another day trading altcoins, Adam told me.

The historic second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is set to start in the US Senate on Feb. 9, but don't expect him to make an appearance. The two sides in the case traded barbs this week after the House's lead impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, sent a letter to Trump's legal team asking that the former president testify under oath and submit to cross-examination either before or during the trial.

Trump lawyer Bruce Castor called the request a ""publicity stunt in order to make up for the weakness of the House managers' case"" and said his client wouldn't provide testimony. Raskin replied that ""any official accused of inciting armed violence against the government of the United States should welcome the chance to testify openly and honestly -- that is, if the official had a defense.""

Trump faces a single article of impeachment that accuses him of incitement of insurrection in regard to the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol, which left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. In a speech that day in front of the White House, Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol as Congress was preparing to certify Joe's Biden's election win.

Trump's legal team has denied that he ""incited the crowd to engage in destructive behavior"" and has said a statement Trump made during his speech -- ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore"" -- had nothing to do with the storming of the Capitol.

To convict Trump, 17 Republicans would need to vote in favor, along with the 48 Democrats and two independents, to reach a two-thirds supermajority. Just five Republicans voted with Senate Democrats against a motion on Jan. 27 to declare the trial unconstitutional. (Trump's legal team has argued that the Senate doesn't have the jurisdiction to decide an impeachment trial, because Trump is no longer president. Others have said that's not the case.)

More than 350 congressional staffers on Wednesday implored the Senate to convict Trump, describing the traumatic events that unfolded within the Capitol on Jan. 6 and saying Trump ""broke America's 230-year legacy of the peaceful transition of power when he incited a mob to disrupt the counting of electoral college votes.""

The House Democrats' impeachment managers laid out their case to the Senate on Tuesday, arguing that the trial must go ahead to protect democracy and deter future presidents from provoking violence.

President Biden has said he supports the trial. Trump ""was impeached by the House and it has to move forward, otherwise it would come off as farcical what this was all about,"" Biden said on People TV, adding that abandoning the trial would ""make a mockery of the system.""

The siege of the Capitol building sought to overturn the 2020 election results and halt the process of confirming Biden's win in the Electoral College. Biden was confirmed after the riot and later inaugurated on Jan. 20. In a historic moment, 10 House Republicans broke with their party to vote in favor of impeachment.

The eventful pretrial period has seen Trump name a new legal team; Republican senators vote to have the trial declared unconstitutional; and the trial's presiding officer, 80-year-old Sen. Patrick Leahy, enter the hospital for several hours after unspecified tests.

We'll explain what we know about how the impeachment trial could progress, what it takes to convict or acquit, what's at stake, and where the situation stands now. This story continues to be updated with new information.

Current schedule of Trump's impeachment trial

The trial is scheduled to unfold as follows:

Jan. 25: Article of impeachment was presented to Senate

Jan. 26: Senators were sworn in, summons for Trump issued

Feb. 2: Trump's answer to article of impeachment due, has been given

Feb. 8: Trump's pretrial brief due

Feb. 9: House's pretrial rebuttal brief due; trial begins

What would happen if Trump is convicted or acquitted

If the former president is convicted in the Senate, there will be an additional vote to bar him from running again (per the US Constitution Article 1, Section 3), which would prevent a possible presidential run in 2024. This vote would only require a simple majority, where Vice President Kamala Harris serving as president of the Senate would cast a tie-breaking vote if required.

Trump could also be disqualified from the benefits given to former presidents by the Post Presidents Act, including a Secret Service security detail, pension and yearly travel allowance.

According to the US Constitution, impeached presidents also can't be pardoned.

If acquitted, Trump would have access to all the benefits of a former US president, including the option to run for public office.

What could happen during Trump's impeachment trial?



The US Constitution lays out clear guidelines for impeaching a sitting president and other officers for ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" Trump's trial is an unusual case, however. With his second impeachment, Trump, who as of Jan. 20 is a private citizen, is the first president to be impeached twice and the first to be tried after leaving office.

The Supreme Court Chief Justice would normally preside over the impeachment trial of a president. But because it's not a trial of a sitting president, it will instead be presided over by Leahy, the new Senate President Pro Tempore, who as a senator is also still expected to be able to vote in the trial, too.

The House will prosecute the case, and the Senate will sit as jury and ultimately vote to convict or acquit.

To convict Trump, 67 senators -- or two-thirds of the Senate -- must vote in favor. Following Biden's inauguration, the Senate is now made up of 48 Democrats, two independents who caucus with Democrats and 50 Republicans, for an even 50-50 split.

Why was Trump impeached in 2019?

Trump was impeached in December 2019 by the House, but the Republican-majority Senate acquitted him at the beginning of 2020.

His first impeachment involved articles accusing Trump of abusing power and obstructing Congress. The issue was Trump's dealings with Ukraine, including a July 2019 phone call in which he appeared to be using US military aid as a bargaining chip to pressure Ukraine into investigating alleged ties between his political opponent Biden, Biden's son Hunter and a Ukrainian gas company. The articles also charged Trump with interfering with a House inquiry into the Ukraine matter.",Trump impeachment trial starts in 2 days: Here's what to know

['Alison Denisco Rayome'],https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/will-you-get-your-own-third-stimulus-check-the-rules-for-qualifying-as-an-adult-may-change/,[],"For the first two checks, whether the IRS counted you as a dependent or an adult determined if you got your own stimulus check, contributed to your family's payment or got nothing at all. But more people may be eligible with a third check, if one is approved.",[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,set(),"Angela Lang/CNET

The first and second stimulus checks provided some much-needed funds to millions of Americans during the pandemic. However, about 13 million young people aged 17 to 24 who were listed as dependents on their parents' taxes weren't eligible to receive any stimulus money from either round of payments, due to a tax code definition of ""child dependent."" And even if you did count as a child dependent, you still didn't get your ""own"" money -- instead, your share of up to $1,200 in the first check and up to $600 in the second check was added on to your family's share.

However, a potential third stimulus check could bring a change that would benefit dependents. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal, which Congress will consider this week, changes the eligibility rules for a third check, so that all dependents -- regardless of age -- would be eligible to get up to $1,400 added on to their family's total payment. It also includes families of mixed-status citizenship, who were excluded from the previous rounds of payments. However, your household's total payment could be determined by whether or not the final bill is targeted to families below a certain income level.

All of the rules can get complicated, and may leave you wondering when it's possible to get a stimulus check of your own. Here, we'll explain what happens depending on your situation, including if you're a student, if you live on your own and are employed, if you're in the military, if you receive SSI or SSDI, if you're married or a parent, or if you're in a child support situation. Some young adults could retroactively get the original stimulus payment of up to $1,200, as well as the second stimulus payment of up to $600 -- keep reading for more information.

Do I count as an adult or a dependent to the IRS?

The first stimulus payment sent out under the March CARES Act allocated up to $1,200 for qualifying American adults, and $500 for the dependents listed on their 2019 tax returns -- so long as they were age 16 or younger. The second stimulus payment, which the IRS finished sending out Jan. 15 under the $900 billion bill, allocates up to $600 per qualifying American adult and $600 for the dependents listed on their 2019 tax returns who were age 16 or younger at that time. While the amount of money changed from the first check to the second, the rules for who qualifies as a child dependent did not.

To qualify for your own second stimulus check, you need to have filed your 2019 taxes independently, which means no one else claimed you on their taxes as a dependent. You also had to have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of under $75,000 to receive the full amount. (The sum decreases as your AGI goes up, and this time around, if you make over $87,000 as a single taxpayer, you aren't eligible for a check.)

There are two different sets of rules for who counts as an adult or a dependent under current tax law, according to Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

One is the support test. If you're unmarried, you don't claim children as your own dependents, your parents provide you with financial support equal to or greater than half of your annual income and you made less than $4,200 in 2019, then your parents can still claim you as their dependent. Another is the residency test: If you're a full-time student under the age of 24 who resides with an adult taxpayer more than half of the year (unless you're living on a college campus), you can be claimed as a dependent, no matter how much money you make.

It's not clear yet which tax return the IRS would use to determine eligibility for a potential third check. It's possible that, like the CARES Act, it would use whichever it has most recently on file, be that your 2020, 2019 or 2018 return.

Now playing: Watch this: Stimulus check No. 3: What you need to know

Why were young adults not included in the first and second stimulus bills?

People aged 17 through 24 were excluded from the CARES Act and the $900 billion bill because of a tax code definition of ""child"" that states a ""qualifying child ... has not attained age 17."" That means even 17- or 18-year-old high school students who clearly lived with a parent or guardian were excluded as dependents and weren't counted for a $500 or $600 addition to the family check.

The reason for this age cutoff has to do with the child tax credit, established in 1997, which allows parents to receive up to a $2,000 tax refund for each child under the age of 17 each year they file. We can only speculate as to why this definition wasn't expanded to include young adults, but the reason is probably the additional cost to the federal government of extending the credit to more people, Holtzer said.

This group was likely excluded from the second stimulus check to keep costs down. However, Biden's proposal includes dependents of all ages in a third stimulus check.

When would a 17- to 24-year-old be eligible to receive a second stimulus payment?

It depends. If you became financially independent in 2020, and you file your 2020 tax return in spring 2021 independently, you'll receive the first stimulus check of up to $1,200 and the second check of up to $600 sometime in 2021 on your tax refund, Holtzer said. All you have to do is file your tax return for 2020 and claim the money as Recovery Rebate Credit, so long as meet the regular eligibility criteria for a stimulus payment.

Angela Lang/CNET

If you're filing taxes independently, the amount of money you would get in a second stimulus payment would depend on your adjusted gross income, which you can also find on your taxes. Check out our story on how to calculate how much money you could get in a second check.

But if a parent or guardian claims you as a dependent on their taxes, you won't get a check of your own. And if you're in that 17-to-24 age range, you likely won't get any money allocated toward your family's payment, either.

What if you're claimed as a dependent on someone's taxes, but you work or go to college?

Even if you work or go to college full-time (or both), you still count as a dependent if you meet either the support test or the residency test mentioned above. Basically, if you rely on your parents or guardians for more than half of your financial support, if you made less than $4,200 in 2019 or you're a full-time student under age 24 who resides with a parent or guardian while not in school, or both, you likely still meet the requirements to count as a dependent.

However, dependents still have to file tax returns, too. Income for dependents falls into two categories: earned income (money earned from working) and unearned income (money earned from investments like the stock market). Those requirements for filing are based on income, so if dependents are receiving either earned or unearned income, they or their parents will need to file a tax return for them.

What if you're considered an emancipated minor?

If you've been emancipated from your parents by a court or through marriage (state laws apply in both cases), you likely wouldn't count as anyone's dependent (assuming you provide more than half of your own financial support and don't live with your parent or guardian anymore), and would file taxes independently. So you'd be eligible for your own stimulus check if you met the requirements.

What if you're currently enlisted in the US Armed Forces?

If you're age 17 or older and have enlisted in the US Armed Forces, you're considered emancipated from your parents or guardians and would file taxes independently. Therefore, you would be eligible for your own stimulus check if you met the requirements.

Sarah Tew/CNET

What if you're under 24 but married or have a child?

If you're under age 24 but are married or have a child of your own whom you claim as a dependent, you're considered independent by the IRS. Therefore, you'd be eligible for your own stimulus check if you meet the requirements.

What if you pay or receive child support?

Typically, the custodial parent is the one who claims the child on their taxes, while the noncustodial parent pays child support. There are some cases where your stimulus check may have been garnished to help pay your child support. If you owe more than $150 in overdue child support (called arrears), your state may reserve the right to garnish some or all of your first stimulus check, based on how much you owe. If you're owed child support, you may receive money garnished from your child's other parent, though it may take a while to get to you after it is processed by the state.

For parents who have joint custody, it's possible that both could get an extra $500 per child dependent as part of their check. It may be the case again with the $600 per-child payment. Find out everything you need to know about stimulus checks and child support here.

What if you're an SSI or SSDI recipient?

If you're a young person who is part of the Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance program, things can get complicated when it comes to stimulus payments. Here are three different circumstances people who receive these benefits may face, and how it might work for you, according to Holtzblatt:

Scenario 1: You are a full-time student and live with your parents for more than half the year (you're considered to be living at home even if you live in a dorm part of the time). You could be claimed as a dependent by your parents, and therefore would not be eligible for a stimulus payment under the CARES Act. While you would be eligible under the current proposal for a second check, that money allotted to you would still be part of your parents' payment.

Scenario 2: You are not a student, but receive more than half of your support/living expenses from your parents or others (like grandparents). If you meet certain other criteria, the person providing support could claim you as a dependent, and therefore you would not be eligible for a stimulus payment under the CARES Act. While you would be eligible under the current proposal for a second check, that money allotted to you would again be part of your parents' payment.

Scenario 3: More than half of your support/living expenses are paid by your SSI or SSDI check. As long as you're not a full-time student or living at home, you cannot be claimed as a dependent, and thus would be eligible for a stimulus payment under the CARES Act. If that was the case for you, you should have received your first check automatically. You would also likely be eligible for a second check that would come directly to you under the current proposal.

Another question we don't have the answer to is, how extensive was the IRS's verification process for eligibility? The agency knew who received Social Security benefits, at least as of a certain date. But we don't know if the IRS was able to identify who among those people was a dependent of another taxpayer when the payments were distributed, Holtzblatt said.

President Joe Biden is standing firm on his goal to send Americans a ""targeted"" $1,400-maximum stimulus check. However, as Congress begins to work out the details on a new COVID-19 relief package this week, it remains unclear what the check's eligibility limitations will be and how much stimulus money your specific household could receive. Democrats are reportedly split on how to alter the stimulus check formula, potentially by including a lower income limit that could bring some families a much smaller check or no money at all from a third stimulus check.

Congress is also considering other changes to the stimulus check qualifications in this round, which will also impact the size of your payment. For example, a new qualification could extend $1,400 to dependents of all ages and include more families with mixed-status citizenship.

While a change to eligibility might dramatically increase a household's stimulus total, it could exist along with newly lowered income limits -- that is, how much money you can make a year and still qualify for a full or partial stimulus check. That uncertainty makes the calculation a little trickier to pin down. Our calculators will help estimate your total, based on what we know. We also illustrate how a shift in the stimulus formula could affect your total share. This story is frequently updated.

Stimulus check calculator for a 'targeted' $1,400 payment



One Democratic proposal, according to The Washington Post, would drop the income limit for individuals and families to qualify for a full stimulus payment. Here's who would get the full amount under this plan, based on your AGI:

Single taxpayer who makes less than $50,000

Head of household who makes less than $75,000

Married couple filing jointly who make less than $100,000

As an individual's or couple's income goes up, the size of the partial payment would get smaller. Under this new proposal, dependents would qualify for a $1,400 payment, up from the $600 Biden outlined in his rescue plan.

The calculator below shows how the payment you could receive phases out at $50 for every $1,000 of income earned above the baseline, which is how the first and second checks were structured. The stimulus calculator won't store or use your data. (Congress could also decide to phase out payments more aggressively than with the first and second checks, reducing payments $100 for every $1,000 of income earned above the baseline.)

Calculator for a $1,400 check with no changes from the second payment



Let's say Congress were to approve a third stimulus check for $1,400 using the income requirements for the first and second payments -- that is, give the full amount to:

Single taxpayer who makes less than $75,000 (based on adjusted gross income

Head of household who makes less than $112,500

Married couple filing jointly who make less than $150,000

Depending on circumstances such as your eligible dependents and other qualifications, you could get more or less. This calculator uses the same basic formula as the first two checks and in this scenario, keeps the $600 amount per dependent. (See below to calculate the new proposal.) CNET's stimulus calculator doesn't store or use your personal details and provides estimates only.

$1,400 stimulus check total with no changes Use details from your 2019 or 2020 tax return. 1. Choose your filing status below. Single Married Head of Household 2. What was your adjusted gross income (AGI)? 3. How many qualified dependents did you claim in your taxes? Calculate

A lower income cap would mean fewer people automatically qualify

When Congress dropped the second stimulus check limit to $600, it automatically disqualified many people, simply because it lowered the income limit (as a result of math).

For example, with the first check, a single tax filer who earned under $75,000 since their previous tax return received the full $1,200. As their adjusted gross income level rose, the total they were entitled to receive fell. After $99,000, they weren't eligible to get anything at all.

Now playing: Watch this: Stimulus check No. 3: What you need to know

With the second check's $600 maximum amount, the cutoff remained $75,000 to receive the total, but using the formula spelled out in the text of the bill, the threshold to receive any amount of stimulus money as an individual (with no children) is an AGI of $87,000. Make more than that and you're not eligible for a check.

If Congress sticks to the same upper income limits for a third stimulus check of $1,400, that would raise that income threshold from $600, making a single taxpayer with an AGI of $75,000 eligible to receive a full payment, with a cutoff to receive a partial payment at $103,000.

With a $1,400 payment using the proposed reduced income cap, however, the lower cap would exclude individuals and families who would have qualified using the first and second check formula. That same single taxpayer now would receive a full $1,400 payment up to an AGI of $50,000 and then phase out completely at $78,000.

Dependents would change the equation, which is why we recommend using our stimulus check calculator for a better estimate of your personal financial picture.

$600 versus $1,400 checks: Total check size compared

Going from $600 to $1,400 -- either with a higher or lower cap on income -- is a big leap any way you look at it. So, we wanted to highlight just what a difference the approaches could make with the handy chart below. Note that the first two columns use the same formula, which makes it easier to compare apples with apples, and the third uses the one reportedly under discussion with the lower cap but more money for dependents.

All figures could change in a final stimulus bill and represent the highest amount a household could get, but remember that just like with the first and second payments, there will be reasons some people may not get the full amount.

Maximum for $600 vs. $1,400 stimulus checks

$600 stimulus check ($600 per child age 16 or under) $1,400 stimulus check ($600 for dependents of any age) $1,400 stimulus check ($1,400 for dependents of any age) Individual taxpayer, 0 dependents $600 maximum $1,400 maximum $1,400 maximum Head of household, 1 dependent $1,200 maximum $2,000 maximum $2,800 maximum Head of household, 2 dependents $1,800 maximum $2,600 maximum $4,200 maximum Head of household, 3 dependents $2,400 maximum $3,200 maximum $5,600 maximum Married couple, 0 dependents $1,200 maximum $2,800 maximum $2,800 maximum Married couple, 1 dependent $1,800 maximum $3,400 maximum $4,200 maximum Married couple, 2 dependents $2,400 maximum $4,000 maximum $5,600 maximum Married couple, 3 dependents $3,000 maximum $4,600 maximum $7,000 maximum

We know Biden wants to expand eligibility in the third stimulus check to dependents of any age. It's a move that would make approximately 13.5 million more adult dependents able to count toward the household total, according to The People's Policy Project. Biden's proposal would also appear to include all families with mixed citizenship status; that is, where at least one family member is a US citizen.

['David Carnoy'],https://www.cnet.com/news/best-wireless-headphones-for-2021/,[],"With many different wireless headphones to choose from, which ones are the best of the best? Here's a look at CNET's top picks -- from full-size noise-canceling models to tiny true wireless earbuds.",[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,"{'Microsoft', 'Sennheiser', 'Bang & Olufsen', 'Bose', 'Sony'}","There are three major categories of wireless headphones: true wireless earbuds such as AirPods and AirPods Pro, full-size wireless noise-canceling headphones (led by Bose and Sony, and the new AirPods Max), and all the budget wireless headphones that dominate the -- because there are plenty of consumers who are done with their wired headphones or earbuds but can't afford the more high-end models. These people are in search of cheap wireless headphones that deliver good value and great sound for lower prices.

Granted, with so many choices, it's hard to narrow things down into a best-of-the best wireless headphones list, especially since it's impossible to review every model on the market. But I'll give it a shot. These are my current favorites. I've considered factors such as sound quality, active noise cancellation and the comfort of the ear cup. I update this list often.

David Carnoy/CNET E D I T O R S ’ C H O I C E Sony's earlier WH-1000XM3 model was great. But if it had a weakness, that was its voice-calling capabilities, particularly in noisier environments. The new WH-1000XM4 improves in that area and also adds multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect to two devices -- such as your phone and PC -- at the same time. That means that if a call comes in while you're using the headphones with your computer, the audio will switch to your phone when you answer the call. The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 probably still have a slight edge for voice calls, but the 1000XM4 headphones are arguably a tad more comfortable and also have some other slight improvements to noise cancellation and sound that make this model a great all-around choice. Read our Sony WH-1000XM4 review.

David Carnoy/CNET Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony, and work very well as a headset for making calls. While I wouldn't recommend them for Android and Windows users, they're the ideal work-from-home headphones for iOS and Mac users who want to switch easily between their devices. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market, along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. Read our Apple AirPods Max review.

David Carnoy/CNET E D I T O R S ’ C H O I C E In many ways, Bose's new $279 noise-canceling QuietComfort Earbuds are excellent true wireless earbuds, particularly when it comes to their sound and to their noise canceling, which is arguably the best out there right now in a set of earbuds. In performance they clearly have a leg up on Apple's best-selling AirPods Pro true wireless noise-canceling buds. However, the AirPods Pro's smaller design, somewhat more comfortable fit and superior voice-calling capabilities make it hard to declare the Bose the straight-up champ. Ultimately, it depends on what your priorities are. Read our Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review.

David Carnoy/CNET E D I T O R S ’ C H O I C E The Momentum True Wireless 2 are better all around than the originals, with a slightly smaller, more comfortable design, active noise canceling that rivals that of the AirPod Pro, improved battery life (up to seven hours versus the original's four) and better noise reduction during calls. Most importantly they have the same stellar sound -- for true wireless earbuds, anyway -- offering clearly superior sound quality to the AirPods Pro. That makes them one of the top true wireless earbuds on the market today and earned them a CNET Editors' Choice Award in 2019. These use Bluetooth 5.1 with support for the AAC and AptX codecs (for devices that have AptX, such as Samsung's Galaxy smartphones). Read our Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 review.

Sarah Tew/CNET E D I T O R S ’ C H O I C E Even if they don't sound as magical as you'd hope a $249 model would, the Apple AirPods Pro still manage to be a great pair of true wireless earphones with noise cancelation. That's largely due to their winning design and fit, improved bass performance and effective noise canceling. They're an excellent choice when you want to make a call or listen to music during your workout. Yeah, they're expensive at $250, but the good news is we're regularly seeing them discounted to $200 and sometimes even slightly less. Read our Apple AirPods Pro review.

David Carnoy/CNET Released in mid-2020, the Jabra Elite 45h was essentially billed as the best on-ear headphone for the money. While there's nothing terribly fancy about it is one of the best on-ear headphone values right now, with good sound quality, a sturdy design and comfortable fit (for on-ear headphones, anyway). Additionally, it performs well as a headset for making calls and includes a sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice in the headphones so you don't talk too loudly. Battery life is also good. Available in multiple color options, it lists for $100 but sometimes gets discounted to $80.

David Carnoy/CNET Say what you will about the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live's bean-shaped design -- yes, they're affectionately known as the Beans -- but they might just be the most innovative new true wireless earbuds of the year. Like the standard Apple AirPods, they have an open design -- you don't jam an ear tip into your ear -- and they're quite comfortable to wear and fit my ears more securely than the AirPods (that said, they won't fit everybody's ears equally well). Additionally, they're discreet and basically sit flush with your ear without a little white pipe extending out from them. They deliver good sound and work well as a headset for making calls, with good background noise reduction so callers can hear you clearly even when you're in noisier environments. While they feature active noise canceling, it's mild compared to the noise canceling in earbuds that have a noise-isolating design. In other words, buy them for their design and sound, not their noise-canceling features. Read our Samsung Galaxy Buds Live review.

David Carnoy/CNET From a design standpoint, the Earfun Free Pro seems identical to the Fiil T1XS. The Earfun Free Pro has better features, however, including active noise cancellation with a transparency mode, wireless charging and Bluetooth 5.2 (apparently, in some parts of the world there's a Fiil T1X Pro that adds noise canceling). They're rated for 7 hours of battery life without the noise-canceling function on, or about 6 hours with it on. They're IPX5 water-resistant, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water. These sound pretty impressive for their moderate price, with decent clarity and bass, and I recommend them and the Mpow X3 (see below) to folks looking for budget true wireless noise-canceling earbuds. These also work pretty well for making calls and they currently cost less than the Mpow X3. Don't expect stellar noise canceling, but it is somewhat effective. They list for $60 but on Amazon, there's often an instant coupon that brings the price down by a few bucks.

David Carnoy/CNET The Mpow X3 wireless earbuds sound shockingly good for their modest price, with good clarity and powerful bass, and they even have active noise cancellation that's fairly effective. Mpow seems to be regularly tweaking its earphones, which were recently updated with better battery life, an improved transparency mode and slightly better touch controls. They did fit me comfortably and securely and I got a tight seal from one of the sets of XL ear tips. They're fully waterproof (IPX8) and get up to seven hours of battery life at moderate volume levels with USB-C charging. (The charging case looks like a fat version of the standard AirPods case.) Call quality is good -- they have a sidetone feature that lets you hear your voice in the earbuds -- but I've used other earbuds with better noise reduction during calls. I noticed a touch of audio lag when I streamed a YouTube video but no problems when streaming iTunes movies.

Angela Lang/CNET Samsung's Buds Plus look essentially the same as the original Galaxy Buds, but their battery life is rated at 11 hours for music playback (up from 6), and they pack dual drivers for better sound and an additional microphone in each bud to help with external noise reduction while making calls. I was impressed with the sound. The audio quality is detailed and smooth, with deep, well-defined bass. The sound is richer and more spacious than that of the original Galaxy Buds. Well-respected Austrian audio company AKG, which Samsung acquired when it bought Harman, is behind the audio. While the original Buds were also ""tuned"" by AKG, these are a nice upgrade over the originals -- and right there with what you get with the Jabra Elite 75t, if not even a touch better. They use Bluetooth 5.0 and support for AAC (there's now an app for iOS users) and Samsung's scalable codec, which is similar to aptX but is proprietary to Samsung Galaxy phones. Read our Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus review.

Sarah Tew/CNET The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, the successor to Bose's QuietComfort 35 II model, may not be a quantum leap forward, but these headphones offer slightly better sound and noise cancellation along with top-notch headset performance for voice calls. They're a strong all-around audio performer with up to 20 hours of battery life and a more durable design than their predecessor (some find the QuietComfort 35 II headphones slightly more comfortable). At launch, they cost $400, but they've recently come down in price. We've seen the white version dip as low as $299 while the black and silver versions have hit $340. That said, the new Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, their closest competitor, has also seen nice discounts. These have a more balanced sound than that model (the Sony has more aggressive bass), and I sometimes prefer its sound signature to the Sony's. Read our Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review.

E D I T O R S ’ C H O I C E While the Elite 75t has been out a while, it's still one of the best true wireless earbuds out there and recently added noise canceling via a firmware upgrade. Earlier firmware updates improved voice-calling performance. The Elite 75t aren't quite as comfortable to wear as the AirPods Pro, but they do sound better, with clearer overall sound and better bass audio quality definition, so long as you get a tight seal. The slightly more rugged Elite Active 75t is also available for about $20 more, but with the new Elite 85t's arrival we are seeing some nice sales on the Elite 75t. Read our Jabra Elite 75t review.

Amazon As far as sound, comfort level and build quality, you'd be hard-pressed to do better than Anker's SoundCore Life Q30 for the money. It doesn't quite have the clarity or bass definition as some of the top premium models, but it's less than a third of the price and gets you about 75% of the way there in terms of sound (it's well balanced overall with punchy bass and there's an app that allows you to tweak the sound). Noise canceling is good for the price, though not up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM4 or Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Battery life is rated at an impressive 40 hours with USB-C charging. The only area where the Q30 falls a little short is for voice calls. It picks up your voice fine in quieter environments but it just doesn't reduce background noise all that well. Compared to the $60 Q20, the Q30 does offer improved sound (it's not a huge difference, but it definitely is a notch up) and a more premium design. Anker often offers the Q20 at a $10 discount at Amazon. Eventually, we should see something like that on the Q30.

David Carnoy/CNET Known for its excellent sounding, retro-designed, open-back wired headphones, Grado has long been a favorite among audiophiles, earning extra points for building many of its headphones by hand in Brooklyn, New York, for over 60 years. But with the world moving to wireless audio, the company has slowly shifted into the Bluetooth headphone arena, first with its GW100 on-ear model (in 2018) and now with its first true wireless earbuds, the GT220 ($259). Grado says it's been working for two years to fit them with its ""signature"" mini-drivers and tune them accordingly. The good news is they sound fantastic -- for true-wireless earbuds anyway -- and perform well as a headset for making calls. Their more penetrating fit (the buds have to be jammed into your ears), which provides very good passive noise-muffling, may not work for everybody. But if you're OK with it, these are easily among the best-sounding true-wireless earbuds out there -- and maybe even the best-sounding. Audiophile headphones are often associated with more of a flat or neutral sound profile that delivers ""accurate"" sound. These are well-balanced but they have a more exciting sound profile, with bass that's a touch more forward and nice sparkle in the treble. They are more revealing and articulate than Sennheiser's True Wireless Momentum II earbuds, which come across as warmer and a bit more open with slightly bigger sound. These use Bluetooth 5.0 with support for the AAC and aptX codecs (for devices that have aptX, like Samsung's Galaxy smartphones). Read our Grado GT220 review.

David Carnoy/CNET Google's Pixel Buds 2 are worthy contenders in the premium true wireless earbuds arena, particularly for Android phones. Featuring hands-free Google Assistant (for Android), they offer a comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for true wireless. Additionally, they're good for making calls and their touch controls work quite well. At five hours, their battery life isn't as good as some new models that are hitting the market, but it's on par with the AirPods Pro's battery life and the well-designed wireless charging case gives you an additional 19 hours (there is a quick-charge feature). The Pixel Buds 2 will eventually be available in four color options (white, black, mint and orange), but at launch you can only get them in white. This true wireless earbud option uses Bluetooth 5.0 with support for the AAC codec but not aptX. Read our Google Pixel Buds 2 (2020) review.

Sarah Tew/CNET Thanks to the WF-1000XM3, Sony has finally become a player in the true wireless (AirPod-style) headphone arena. While this pair of headphones isn't cheap, as far as sound quality, they're the best wireless earbuds at this price. They match and perhaps even exceed the quality and performance of pricier competitors from Sennheiser, Beats, Master & Dynamic and Bang & Olufsen. They also have a feature that those wireless earbuds don't: active noise-cancellation technology to reduce ambient noise. They're not stellar for making calls (their noise-reduction capabilities should be better) and the earbuds aren't rated as sweatproof or waterproof. That said, I've used them for light workouts with a bit of a sweat at the gym without a problem. They use Bluetooth 5.0 with support for AAC, but not aptX. Since they've been out a while, look to buy them on sale. They're often discounted to around $170 and we expect Sony to release the WF-1000XM4 in the not-so-distant future. Read our Sony WF-1000XM3 review.

Sarah Tew/CNET The Jaybird Vista have been out a while, but they remain some of the best sport earbuds, with good sound, a secure fit and a fully waterproof design. We expect something new from Jaybird in the near future, so grab these when they're discounted (around the holidays they were $100). Read our Jaybird Vista review.

When it comes to space happenings, few are as thrilling as landing a vehicle on another planet. It's tense, exciting, high stakes. On Thursday, Feb. 18, NASA's Perseverance rover will aim to stick the landing on Mars, kicking off a new era in red planet exploration.

While NASA has a lot of experience with delivering machines to Mars (here's looking at you, Curiosity and InSight), that doesn't make it any easier this time. ""Landing on Mars is hard,"" NASA said. ""Only about 40% of the missions ever sent to Mars – by any space agency - have been successful.""

It's going to be a wild ride. Here's what to expect on Perseverance's landing day.

How to watch

NASA will provide live coverage of the landing. The NASA TV broadcast from mission control kicks off on Thursday, Feb. 18 at 11:15 a.m. PT. Touch down in the Jezero Crater on Mars is scheduled for around 12:30 p.m. PT.

This won't be like a rocket launch where we get to see every detail as it's happening. We will get NASA commentary and updates, views from mission control, and hopefully some images not too long after landing. It will be a must-watch event for space fans.

We've been to Mars before. So why all the hype? The red planet is our solar system neighbor. It's rocky like Earth. It has a long history of water. We can imagine ourselves perhaps living there some day.

Gorman highlighted humanity's search for life beyond Earth and how Mars is a candidate for having hosting microbial life in its ancient past.

There's also something special about a rover, a wheeled mechanical creature with a ""head"" and ""eyes."" ""People feel towards the rovers because they're active and they move,"" said Gorman, likening it an almost parental sense of attachment. The outpouring of emotion over the demise of NASA's Opportunity rover proves how connected humans can get to a Mars explorer. Perseverance is set to become our new Martian sweetheart.

Seven minutes of terror

Mars arrivals are always harrowing. NASA calls the process EDL for ""entry, descent and landing.""

""During landing, the rover plunges through the thin Martian atmosphere, with the heat shield first, at a speed of over 12,000 mph (about 20,000 kph),"" said NASA in a landing explainer. There's a reason NASA describes the landing process as ""seven minutes of terror.""

Small thrusters will fire to keep the rover on track on the potentially bumpy ride through the atmosphere. The rover's protective heat shield helps to slow it down. At an altitude of around 7 miles (11 kilometers), a supersonic parachute will deploy and Perseverance will soon separate from its heat shield.

NASA gave a briefing on Jan. 27 with a detailed rundown on the entire EDL sequence, including the ""sky crane"" maneuver, which lowers the rover the final distance to the surface using a set of cables.

If all goes well, Perseverance will end up standing on the surface of Mars. ""The really hard part is to soft land and not crash land, and then to deploy the moving parts,"" said Gorman. Perseverance is not alone on the trip. It also carries a helicopter named Ingenuity in its belly. Ingenuity will be unleashed later in the mission.

Now playing: Watch this: How NASA's Mars helicopter could change the future of...

Experiencing the landing



The mission is equipped with cameras and microphones designed to capture the EDL process, so we can expect to both see and hear the excitement of the landing at some point. ""It will be the raw sounds of the descent and coming onto the surface,"" said Gorman. ""So that's a whole other level of sensory engagement.""

It takes time to send data between Mars and Earth. For us back home, we can expect a first photo not too long after landing, but the full visual and audio experience may take a few days for NASA to share with the world.

The agency released an arrival trailer in December that shows an animated, sped-up version of the process. You'll get the idea of just how wild it is to land a rover on another planet.

Gorman is excited about getting visuals of the rover's landing spot in Jezero Crater. It will be our first close-up look at the landscape in an area that had a history of water. Perseverance hopes to explore that history and look for evidence of life.

While the photos, sounds, helicopter and all-around science will be reasons to celebrate, there's the big lingering question the mission might answer: Was Mars home to microbial life? Said Gorman, ""It would just be really great if we've got a bit of a closer handle on whether anything once lived on Mars.""

Perseverance is our next great hope in the search for signs of life beyond Earth. It all starts with sticking the landing.

Enjoy.",[''],en,,https://www.cnet.com,,"{'game', 'Super Bowl', 'General Motors'}","Enlarge Image Rob DeMartin/Jeep

The Super Bowl has just ended, and while the Big Game itself wasn't much of a contest this year, we wouldn't blame you if you just watched for the splashy commercials. These days, most of the game's high-dollar ads end up getting released early to help extend the news cycle a bit. However, others didn't come out until Sunday night, so we're rounding up all of the automotive ads -- the best and the rest -- in one convenient place for your viewing pleasure.

Naturally, 2020 was a difficult year for everyone, so the ratio of humorous commercials to the ones that try to tug at your heartstrings is shaping up to be a little more skewed toward the latter than usual, that's to be expected and no bad thing. We're also seeing fewer car-focused ads than usual this year, with auto manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia opting out despite big showings in the past. That said, there are some long-form, splashy ads, especially from domestic automakers. General Motors has opted for humor, Jeep has gone all-in for heartstring-tugging patriotism.

Jeep's ""The Middle""

It's taken almost six decades, but Bruce Springsteen has finally decided to appear in a commercial. Fittingly, it's a sprawling and ambitious two-minute-long spot from Jeep that's far more about the state of America than the state of the company's new model sales. ""The Middle"" centers on a small church in Lebanon, Kansas, that sits at the geographic center of the Lower 48. The ad sees the legendary rocker and poet calling for our fractured country to come together and find common ground as a nation, somehow avoiding coming off as heavy-handed or preachy. It's worth a watch.

General Motors' ""No Way Norway""

This is also one of our favorite commercials so far this year. It features comedian Will Ferrell at his most unhinged as he tries to rally the US to beat Norway in electric-car adoption, and we get plenty of beauty shots of Cadillac's extremely handsome Lyriq EV, which is coming for 2023. Saturday Night Live's (and Goodburger's) Kenan Thompson makes an appearance, as does Awkwafina in the the General's forthcoming Hummer EV.

Cadillac's ""Edgar Scissorhands""

Released on Sunday just hours before the Big Game, this seriously funny parody of Tim Burton's masterpiece, Edward Scissorhands, sees future Dune star Timothée Chalamet cast as Edgar Scissorhands, son of Edward, dreaming of driving a car. His mom, played by Winona Ryder, reprising her role as Kim Boggs, goes above and beyond and gets him a new SUV with a tech twist.

Ford's ""Finish Strong""

The Blue Oval has been big on serious, make-you-think-and-get-your-feelings-going kinds of ads for a few years now, and you know with the global pandemic, that the folks from Dearborn were going to double down during the Super Bowl. The company's ""Finish Strong"" spot features narration by actor Brian Cranston, along with a bunch of Americans doing American things like bumping face shields and graduating high school.

Toyota's ""Jessica Long's Story""

Toyota's ""Jessica Long's Story"" gives us a look at the Paralympic swimmer's childhood, from her adoption by American parents from Siberia and the difficulties imposed by her double leg amputation stemming from a childhood disease. It isn't really about cars, instead, it's kind of a tear-jerker and gets us in the same way that the 2019 Rav4 Hybrid commercial featuring Toni Harris got us.

Vroom's ""Dealership Pain""

Vroom isn't a vehicle manufacturer -- it's an app for buying cars -- but it's getting in on the fun with its weirdly dark ""Dealership Pain"" ad that shows a mustachioed car salesman threatening a car shopper with torture. Sure, the car dealership experience can be kind of a drag, but generally speaking, it's not exactly the Spanish Inquisition, either.

Weathertech's ""Family""

Weathertech may be a company with a significant presence in motorsports and with an owner obsessed with cars, but the company's Super Bowl ads don't ever seem to show any of that. Instead, this spot is a series of employee testimonials about how valued they feel working at Weathertech. It's kind of nice and will probably sell some floormats.

Weathertech's ""We Never Left""

Not content to just have one Super Bowl spot, Weathertech did a second ad touting its history of manufacturing things in the US. This is a callout to other companies that off-shored their production and which are now sounding their trumpets for bringing it back to the US.

CarMax



Well, CarMax bought ad time in the Super Bowl and weirdly didn't seem to be that interested in making something memorable or even compelling. Our guess is that the used car retailer had budget leftover that HAD to be spent. I mean, as of publication, CarMax hasn't even put the video on its official YouTube channel. Spoiler alert: the best part is the Saint Bernard at the end.

Of course, there are likely to be many more car ads that aren't being revealed in advance, but rest assured, we'll be watching the game and sharing those spots with you here as they air, so keep it locked here on Roadshow.",Super Bowl commercial roundup: Watch all of the car-themed ads right here
['Robert Reich'],https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/trump-senate-impeachment-trial-republicans-robert-reich,[],One of the nation’s two major political parties has abandoned democracy and reality. We must now move a vast swath of America back into a fact-based pro-democracy society,[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"Next week’s Senate trial is unlikely to convict Donald Trump of inciting sedition against the United States. At least 17 Republican senators are needed for conviction, but only five have signaled they’ll go along.

Why won’t Republican senators convict him? After all, it’s an open and shut case. As summarized in the brief submitted by House impeachment managers, Trump spent months before the election telling his followers that the only way he could lose was through “a dangerous, wide-ranging conspiracy against them that threatened America itself”.

Immediately after the election, he lied that he had won by a “landslide”, and later urged his followers to stop the counting of electoral ballots by making plans to “fight like hell” and “fight to the death” against this “act of war” perpetrated by “Radical Left Democrats” and the “weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party”.

If this isn’t an impeachable offense, it’s hard to imagine what is. But Republican senators won’t convict him because they’re answerable to Republican voters, and Republican voters continue to believe Trump’s big lie.

A shocking three out of four Republican voters don’t think Joe Biden won legitimately. About 45% even support the storming of the Capitol.

The crux of the problem is Americans now occupy two separate worlds – a fact-based pro-democracy world and a Trump-based authoritarian one.

Trump spent the last four years seducing voters into his world, turning the GOP from a political party into a grotesque projection of his pathological narcissism.

Regardless of whether he is convicted, America must now deal with the monstrous predicament he left behind: one of the nation’s two major political parties has abandoned reality and democracy.

What to do? Four things.

First, prevent Trump from running for president in 2024. The mere possibility energizes his followers.

An impeachment conviction is not the only way to prevent him. Under section three of the 14th amendment to the constitution, anyone who has taken an oath to protect the constitution is barred from holding public office if they “have engaged in insurrection” against the United States. As constitutional expert and former Yale Law professor Bruce Ackerman has noted, a majority vote that Trump engaged in insurrection against the United States is sufficient to trigger this clause.

Second, give Republicans and independents every incentive to abandon the Trump cult.

White working-class voters without college degrees who now comprise a large portion of its base need good jobs and better futures. Many are understandably angry after being left behind in vast enclaves of unemployment and despair. They should not have to depend on Trump’s fact-free fanaticism in order to feel visible and respected.

A jobs program on the scale necessary to bring many of them around will be expensive but worth the cost, especially when democracy hangs in the balance.

Big business, which used to have a home in the GOP, will need a third party. Democrats should not try to court them; the Democratic party should aim to represent the interests of the bottom 90%.

Third, disempower the giant media empires that amplified Trump’s lies for four years – Facebook, Twitter and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and its imitators. The goal is not to “cancel” the political right but to refocus public deliberation on facts, truth and logic. Democracy cannot thrive where big lies are systematically and repeatedly exploited for commercial gain.

The goal is not to 'cancel' the political right but to refocus public deliberation on facts, truth and logic

The solution is antitrust enforcement and stricter regulation of social media, accompanied by countervailing financial pressure. Consumers should boycott products advertised on these lie factories and advertisers should shun them. Large tech platforms should lose legal immunity for violence-inciting content. Broadcasters such as Fox News and Newsmax should be liable for knowingly spreading lies (they are now being sued by producers of voting machinery and software which they accused of having been rigged for Biden).

Fourth, safeguard the democratic form of government. This requires barring corporations and the very wealthy from buying off politicians, ending so-called “dark money” political groups that don’t disclose their donors, defending the right to vote and ensuring more citizens are heard, not fewer.

Let’s be clear about the challenge ahead. The major goal is not to convict Trump for inciting insurrection. It is to move a vast swath of America back into a fact-based pro-democracy society and away from the Trump-based authoritarian one.

Regardless of whether he is convicted, the end of his presidency has given the nation a reprieve. But unless America uses it to end Trumpism’s hold over tens of millions of Americans, that reprieve may be temporary.

Thankfully, Joe Biden appears to understand this.",Trump left behind a monstrous predicament. Here's how to tackle it
['Sidney Blumenthal'],https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/mike-pence-donald-trump-republicans-religion-evangelical,[],"As vice-president, he abased himself and his office. In reward, Donald Trump sent a mob to kill him. Now, as another impeachment trial looms, he is cast out from Republican ranks",[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"After Donald Trump had exhausted all of his claims of voter fraud and could contrive no more conspiracy theories that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, and after his revolving menagerie of legal mouthpieces had all of their motions tossed out of every venue up to the supreme court, and after his reliable enabler, Attorney General William Barr, informed him his accusations were false and he had reached the end of the line, and resigned, Trump came as a last resort to rest his slipping hold on power on his most unwavering defender and ceaseless flatterer, who had never let him down: his vice-president, Mike Pence.

Nobody was more responsible for fostering the cult of Trump. The evangelical Pence had been Trump’s rescuer, starting with his forgiveness for the miscreant in the crisis during the 2016 campaign over Trump’s Access Hollywood “grab them by the pussy” tape and then over the disclosure of the “Individual One” hush money payoff to a porn star about a one-night stand to shut her up before election day – AKA “the latest baseless allegations”. Pence was the indispensable retainer who delivered the evangelical base, transforming it through the alchemy of his faith into Trump’s rock of ages. After every malignant episode, from Charlottesville (“I stand with the president”) to coronavirus (“The president took another historic step”), the pious Pence could be counted on to bless Trump for his purity of heart and to shepherd the flock of true believers.

“Trump’s got the populist nationalists,” Stephen Bannon, Trump’s pardoned former senior adviser, remarked. “But Pence is the base. Without Pence, you don’t win.”

Withstanding the howling winds of narcissism, the unshakably self-abasing Pence upheld the cross over Trump. On the evening of 3 May 2017, Trump welcomed his evangelical advisory board for dinner in the Blue Room of the White House.

“I’ve been with [Trump] alone in the room when the decisions are made,” Pence testified to the assembled pastors. “He and I have prayed together. This is somebody who shares our views, shares our values, shares our beliefs.”

Nobody more than Pence had modeled adulation of Trump to become the standard for sycophantic imitation. At the first meeting of members of Trump’s cabinet, on 12 June 2017, the president called on each to offer praise.

“I’m going to start with our vice-president. Where is our vice-president?” Trump asked. “We’ll start with Mike and then we’ll just go around, your name, your position.”

“This is just the greatest privilege of my life,” Pence said, setting the tone for the others.

By August, Pence had mentioned Trump’s “broad shoulders” 17 times, to proclaim his manly strength. At the cabinet meeting of 20 December 2017, Pence praised Trump 14 times in just under three minutes, a commendation every 12.5 seconds, concluding in his last breathless, fawning words: “And we are making America great again.” On 6 June 2018, at a meeting of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump suddenly and inexplicably put his water bottle on the floor. Without missing a beat, Pence, seated beside him, put his bottle on the floor too.

Finally, after 61 failed lawsuits challenging the presidential election, Trump’s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis told him there was a magic solution. Pence, presiding over the counting of the ballots of the electoral college before a joint session of Congress on 6 January, could overturn results in the key states that had gone against Trump, by deciding himself which votes to certify and which to reject. Rightwing social media was awash with rumors about “the Pence card”.

Pence sought the opinions of an array of conservative legal experts, who uniformly stated that he had no such authority. For days, Trump badgered him. On 4 January, campaigning in Georgia for Republican senatorial candidates, Trump said: “If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House, and they’re not going to take the White House, we’re going to fight like hell, I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you … He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through I won’t like him quite as much … He’s a wonderful man, a smart man and a man I like a lot.”

You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy Donald Trump

On the day before the electoral college votes were to be certified, 5 January, Trump tweeted, “The Vice-President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.” Hours later, Trump cornered Pence in the Oval Office. He had brought along a rightwing law professor, John Eastman, from Chapman University, who argued that Pence had the power to overturn the electoral college. Eastman had written an op-ed asserting that Kamala Harris was ineligible to run for vice-president because she was not a proper US citizen – a new birtherism. Trump told Pence Eastman was “very highly qualified”. For once, Pence stood his ground. His reverence turned into recalcitrance. He rebuffed Trump. There was a line he would not cross.

That night, after the New York Times reported that Pence felt “he would need to balance the president’s misguided beliefs about government with his own years of preaching deference to the constitution”, Trump issued a statement: “The New York Times report regarding comments Vice-President Pence supposedly made to me today is fake news. He never said that. The Vice-President and I are in total agreement that the Vice-President has the power to act.”

Before dawn on 6 January, after it was clear the Republicans had lost both seats in Georgia and with them control of the Senate, Trump frantically engaged in a tweet storm.

“States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!”

Then Trump called Pence at the vice-presidential residence, the Naval Observatory, to deliver an ultimatum. “You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy,” Trump said. But Pence spurned him again. He hung up and got into his motorcade. As he drove to the Capitol, Trump mounted the platform at his “Stop the Steal” rally outside the White House, to address thousands of followers.

Trump knew Pence intended to perform his constitutionally prescribed duty to preside over the process that would seal Joe Biden’s election. Pence had repeatedly told Trump that was what he would do. Trump had tried every means to dislodge him from his position, but Pence proved immovable. Trump’s call that morning, threatening him as a “pussy”, was the last desperate gambit. Trump knew the string was played out.

But when he addressed the crowd he had assembled, Trump pretended he did not know what Pence was going to do. Stung by Pence’s emphatic refusal, he knew he was retailing a false narrative. He feigned that Pence had not yet made up his mind – and that the entire decision now depended upon him. Trump built up the dramatic suspense, stoked the crowd’s anger and directed its fixation. Trump turned the entire crisis on to Pence.

Trump referred to Pence 13 times in his speech:

I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election … All Vice-President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest people. And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: ‘Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage’ … And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our constitution … And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories … They want to re-certify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn’t listen to the Rinos [Republicans In Name Only] and the stupid people that he’s listening to …

Targeting Pence, Trump urged his followers forward. “And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more … So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue”– to the Capitol.

Trump was well aware that the crowd contained violent elements. He knew it was not like one of the festive crowds that attended his campaign rallies, warmed up with singing and dancing. In his 1 October debate with Biden, Trump had given a shoutout to the white supremacist Proud Boys, calling out their name and giving them a slogan: “Stand back and stand by.” On 12 December, Proud Boys led thousands of paramilitary demonstrators to protest against the election result in Washington.

“WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!” Trump tweeted that morning to greet them. That night, the Proud Boys roamed the streets, provoking fights. Four people were stabbed, one shot, a police officer assaulted and 33 people arrested. The Proud Boys’ leader, Enrique Tarrio, was later arrested for burning a “Black Lives Matter” banner at a historic Black church and charged with two counts of felony for illegal possession of high-capacity guns.

“We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don’t let them take it away!” Trump tweeted on 18 December. The next day he tweeted: “Big protest on 6 January. Be there, will be wild!”

Arriving at the Capitol that day, taking his place in the Senate chamber at 1pm, Pence issued a statement: “It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.”

Trump was just finishing speaking. The spearhead of the mob had already broken through the police perimeter on the west side of the Capitol. Just after 2pm, led by the Proud Boys and other paramilitary groups, the mob poured through smashed windows and doors and rushed into the corridors, chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!”

“Once we found out Pence turned on us and that they had stolen the election, like, officially, the crowd went crazy. I mean, it became a mob,” said one rioter, later arrested, in a video posted on YouTube. Another of those arrested texted: “When we found out Pence fucked us, we all stormed the Capitol building and everyone forced entry and started breaking shit. It was a like a scene out of a movie.”

But many of those assaulting the Capitol had already received Trump’s tinfoil cue to focus on Pence. The FBI charging paper for one arrested rioter, an alleged QAnon militant, quoted a text message two weeks before the attack: “I’m there for the greatest celebration of all time after Pence leads the Senate flip!! OR IM THERE IF TRUMP TELLS US TO STORM THE FUKIN CAPITAL IMA DO THAT THEN! We don’t want any trouble but they are not going to steal this election that I guarantee bro!!”

Secret service agents hustled Pence out of the chamber. “Where’s Mike Pence?” chanted the mob, racing to locate him. They carried a noose, marked with his name. Pence was in an office only about 100ft away. A quick-thinking Capitol police officer steered the rampaging throng to chase him in the opposite direction. At 2.24pm, amid the mayhem, Trump tweeted: “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!”

Dozens of messages immediately appeared on Gab, a social media networking site favored by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, encouraging those inside the Capitol to capture Pence.

“I heard at least three different rioters at the Capitol say that they hoped to find Vice-President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor,” reported Jim Bourg, the Reuters picture editor in Washington. “It was a common line being repeated. Many more were just talking about how the VP should be executed.”

At 3.55pm, Pence tweeted: “The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now.” Nearly five hours later, the Capitol had been cleared, the Senate reconvened and Pence stood at the dais. On the desk, a note had been left for him by the shirtless, horned fur-hatted, face-painted, self-proclaimed “QAnon shaman”, one Jacob Chansley.

“It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming,” it read.

At 3.34am, in the early hours of 7 January, Pence affirmed that Joe Biden had won the election. Five people, including a Capitol police officer, would die as a result of the riot; 140 police were injured.

Throughout the pandemonium in the Capitol, Trump did not seek to discover whether Pence was safe. He did not call him. He was watching the insurrection on TV at the White House, “excited” and “delighted”, according to the Republican senator Ben Sasse, who told of accounts heard from aides who were with the president. Trump never did call Pence.

“I’ve known Mike Pence for ever,” said a friend, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma. “I’ve never seen Pence as angry … He said, ‘After all the things I’ve done for [Trump].’”

On 8 January, Trump announced he would not attend the inauguration. Pence stated that he would be there, to see Biden take the oath of office.

On the mantle above the fireplace in his library at the vice-president’s residence, Pence placed a framed passage from the Bible’s Book of Jeremiah.

“‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’”

Servant leadership is biblical. That’s at the heart of it for Mike, in his relationship with the president Marc Short

For Pence, the quotation from scripture was a complacent blessing from the gospel of prosperity. (He conveniently did not frame other passages from Jeremiah preceding and following his favorite citation: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the Lord … “You should put any maniac who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons.”)

Pence did not know God’s plan for him. He was just certain that God had one in mind. Pence did not voice the prophesy. He was no prophet. He was not the oracle. But he knew that he had a divinely ordained destiny. He believed it would unfold with his heavenly ascent to the highest position, becoming president as reward for his faithful humility. He adhered to the evangelical notion of “servant leadership”, Marc Short, his chief of staff and a fellow evangelical, explained to the Atlantic. Pence modeled himself on Jesus washing his disciples’ feet, a model for evangelicals to follow in his example toward Trump: “Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave.”

“Servant leadership is biblical,” Short said. “That’s at the heart of it for Mike, and it comes across in his relationship with the president.”

The political marriage of Pence and Trump was an alliance of opposites, a calibrated balancing act of the pious and the pitiless, the sacred and the profane, the bland Hoosier and the brash New Yorker, the lockstep partisan and the egotist. It was also a team of media celebrities, minor and major, the trusted voice from the heartland leading his true believers to the TV reality show confidence man.

Pence had risen to prominence as a conservative talkshow host in Indiana, “His Mikeness”, self-described as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf”, opening every show: “Greetings across the amber waves of grain.” When local Republicans urged him to run for Congress, his intimate adviser, his wife, Karen, whom he calls “Mother”, interpreted two hawks flying overhead as God’s sign. Pence served six undistinguished terms, ingratiated himself with the Koch brothers’ donor network as its servant, and the party elevated him to the Indiana governor’s chair. His principal accomplishment was to enact a bill discriminating against gay people, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which under widespread criticism and threats of boycott he essentially rescinded. He was uncertain of re-election; then Trump plucked him from obscurity. Another sign.

The relationship was set in stone at the beginning. The Access Hollywood tape was the formative event. Everything followed from Trump’s risky business and Pence’s avid devotion. When the scandal broke, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, organized pressure on Trump to quit and Pence to assume his place, according to Pence’s biographer Tom LoBianco.

“Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately,” tweeted Senator John Thune, of South Dakota. Karen Pence was “livid”. But Pence refused to drink from the chalice he was offered, believing it to be poisoned. If he replaced Trump, he would be blamed for destroying him and the inevitable election defeat. Instead, he believed Trump would lose and he, Pence, would be ideally positioned to be the Republican nominee in 2020, to take on President Hillary Clinton. And when Trump survived and went on to win, Pence was the next in line.

Pence was not blind about Trump. Karen Pence confided to one of his aides: “We knew we were signing up for something unique. We knew there would be times he’d say and do things we’d never do. We understood that … Obviously, it’s disappointing, but it doesn’t change the mission.”

Trump was Pence’s cross to bear. Whether Pence respected him was beside the point. Trump only wanted to be worshipped. He obviously thought he had endless use of the simplistic Pence as his tool. But Pence knew that both he and Trump were tools of the Lord, though for different purposes. He wanted to create a worshipful presence for Trump, toward greater ends about which Trump was completely unknowing. Pence had been put into his position for the Lord’s purposes, in an unfolding divine story. He was right with the Lord. He was not only elected; he was among the elect. The Lord blessed his servant. The blessing was a promise of his ever-rising advancement so long as he was steadfast. He stayed the course no matter the tribulations and privations. His destiny had been written. He proved himself worthy by his steadfastness in bearing the desecrations of the unworthy Trump. Every further revelation of Trump’s character confirmed that Pence was being tested for the time beyond Trump. Pence carried his cross for a glorious consummation for the most faithful of the Lord’s chosen, Mike Pence.

If Pence maintained his equanimity, he could keep moving forward. His voice was steady, his manner was steady and when a fly landed on his head in his debate with Kamala Harris, he was steady. He had practice with far greater distractions. This fly didn’t do anything embarrassing, except land on his head. It was not the fly’s fault. Pence could bear everything.

But the more Pence succeeded in achieving his perfection of humility and show of gratitude, the more he persuaded the evangelicals it was Trump who was divinely anointed. Regardless of how Pence saw himself in his inner vision, through his ministrations the evangelicals came to see Trump as the one who made America right with the Lord. Pence made sure the credit went to his lord. He rendered unto Caesar.

Pence did not know that staying the course would be his undoing. His role as president of the Senate in presiding over the counting of the electoral college votes was largely ceremonial and passive. Pence believed he was true to the constitution –under God. He had taken his oath on his Bible. His presence naturally lent the process legitimacy. For Trump, that was the problem. Pence’s faith created a schism not only with Trump, but also with his ambition.

Trump by his lights had not lost the election; it was stolen. Trump could never be a loser. He had won. He was being deprived of his victory. Pence alone could change it. If he did not, he explained Trump’s failure. The fault was displaced on to Pence.

We knew we were signing up for something unique Karen Pence

Pence bestowed on Trump the fatal kiss. Pence was the Judas. He did not ever imagine he was Judas, but always God’s servant. Judas knew he was betraying Jesus, but Pence never thought he was betraying Trump. Pence never knew that all along, this was part of God’s plan.

Upholding his oath, Pence’s hopes turned to ashes. He became something he never anticipated: the fall guy. He never expected he would be Trump’s patsy. It was one thing to be his flunky, but Pence never thought, even after all the other adults in the room had departed in obloquy, he’d be the last patsy standing.

Pence may consider himself one of the most unselfish Christians. The extreme case of humility is when a person gives his all to someone who is completely selfish and has no other purpose. Now loathed by evangelicals, Pence must console himself with the holy paradox invested in martyrs, in which the martyr scorned by his own people suffers for the greater good of the Lord. Only later is the martyr beatified as a saint. Becoming such a martyr might get Pence a stained-glass window in some future crystal cathedral, but it will not get him anywhere in the Republican party.

Pence is reportedly isolated, in a borrowed cabin in Indiana, having arranged to be a “visiting fellow” at the Heritage Foundation.

No evangelical leader has stepped forward to defend his honor. No Republican leader has vouched for his virtue, obligations and higher loyalty. Abandoned and alone, the object of hatred, the target of threats. Pence had taught his flock to worship its lord and cast out heretics. He delivered everything to Trump, and Trump delivered Pence to the mob as a scapegoat. Pence had shown them the way to follow Trump as a true servant. And they did.

Rich and powerful nations have rushed to lock up supply of multiple vaccine candidates. Worse, some are hoarding vaccines – purchasing many times more doses than they need. This leaves African and other developing countries either far behind in the vaccine queue, or not in it at all.

There are worrying signs of vaccine nationalism in Europe and North America. The pressures on political leaders to vaccinate all their citizens before sharing supplies with others is understandable. But forcing smaller or poorer countries to wait until everyone in the north has been catered for is shortsighted.

Delaying access to vaccines for citizens of developing countries is ultimately many times more costly. The pandemic will rage on, crippling the global economy. New mutations may continue to emerge at a more rapid pace. The world risks reversing decades of human development gains and eclipsing the 2030 sustainable development goals.

In this context, the billions of dollars it would cost to distribute vaccines across the developing world is not particularly high, given the return on the investment. Doing so would unlock global commerce, which would benefit all trading nations during the long road to economic recovery that lies ahead of us. We need global value chains to be fully operational again and to include everyone.

Last year, the world came together to provide additional fiscal space for developing countries through the debt service suspension initiative at the G20. This helped governments in Africa pay for their Covid responses and provide additional social protection, thereby preventing the worst outcomes. We shouldn’t lose that spirit now and give in to an unfortunate erosion of global solidarity.

The Covax facility, led by the World Health Organization, was supposed to ensure doses for 20% of Africa’s people – right from the start and at the same time as richer countries. However, nearly two months after the first vaccines have been administered, it is still not clear when African nations will be able to start immunising people, though the first doses may begin reaching the continent later this month.

What can be done in practical terms? The rich world can help developing countries get the same fair prices that they have already negotiated for themselves. One pharmaceutical firm is reportedly planning to charge $37 per dose for “small orders”. Recently, one African country reported being asked to pay more than double the price that the European Union had negotiated for the same product.

During natural disasters, price gouging for essential supplies is illegal. It should not be tolerated for vaccines during a pandemic either. If prices are fair, and Africa is allowed to place orders, many countries on the continent would be willing and able to pay for themselves. But, given the current market structure, they will need active support from more powerful countries to do so.

The African Union and Afreximbank have set up the Africa Medical Supplies Platform to help countries secure financing by providing advance commitment guarantees of up to $2bn to manufacturers. The platform has negotiated an initial order of 270m doses, but this is still very far from the 60% coverage Africa needs to achieve some measure of herd immunity, and there is no telling when those supplies will be available.

African countries unite to create 'one stop shop' to lower cost of Covid-19 tests and PPE Read more

Vaccine candidates from China and Russia are also coming online and may provide an alternative for some developing countries. However, the reality is that most countries will only be able to procure vaccines that have been approved by the World Health Organization. The WHO should speed up emergency use approvals for Covid-19 vaccines in line with action taken by major national regulators in Europe and North America.

Africa is not sitting back and waiting for charity. We have learned our lessons from the past. All we ask for is transparency and fairness in vaccine access, not the protectionism currently in play.

Ensuring equitable access to vaccines globally during a pandemic is not only a moral issue, but an economic imperative to protect the wellbeing of people everywhere. But when will Africa get the protection it needs? If all lives are equal, why isn’t access to vaccines?","Until Africans get the Covid vaccinations they need, the whole world will suffer | Paul Kagame"

Actress Evan Rachel Wood has accused Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner) of abuse when they were in a relationship. She claims that he groomed her as a teenager – they began dating when she was 19 and he was 37 – and he manipulated her into submission. Wood previously accused an unnamed person of sexual, emotional and physical abuse, including rape and torture, leaving her with PTSD. Other women have come forward and made similar accusations.

Manson’s ex-wife, Dita Von Teese, and former partner Rose McGowan say he didn’t behave that way with them. (McGowan still supports Manson’s accusers.) Manson denies all allegations as “horrible distortions of reality”, but he has now been dropped by his record label, talent label and management.

One striking aspect is that Manson never hid anything, from music journalists or anyone else. Extremely provocative statements and behaviour were integral to his public persona (though we shouldn’t confuse them with abuse). BDSM sex, drugs, excess, alienation, satanism, stage shows where naked women were dragged around on dog leads and more. His autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, is relentlessly hardcore. (Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor has come forward once again to deny a segment about him and Manson sexually assaulting a heavily intoxicated woman.) After he and Wood split, Manson told an interviewer: “I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.” What was that: a red flag or “Manson just being Manson”? Therein lies the problem, and not just with Manson, rather with the darker elements of rock’n’roll culture itself.

This goes some way to explaining why the #MeToo movement has struggled with exposing past and present abusers (and not only artists). Overt misogyny and sexual boorishness have long been embedded in music culture, involving artists, the people around them and the structure they work within. Also, some of the most powerful enablers of all: music fans who wish to live vicariously through rock stars (drink, drugs, sex) and who celebrate and ultimately drive their worst excessive behaviour. It’s these fan-enablers who have traditionally given artist-abusers the financial incentive and cultural permission to continue.

All of which is fine when it’s confined to daring, chaotic “excess all areas”. Who doesn’t want that from rock stars? It isn’t fine when it leads to abuse, using the excuse of “rock’n’roll behaviour” and the other unspoken justification – that the women, even when insensible and defenceless, were “into it”.

Who are the fan-enablers who helped make this culture acceptable? (Me? You?). Is it finally changing? Certainly, the stale argument of “different times” no longer holds. Whatever happens regarding Manson, the music industry was never right to indulge the mindset that the abuse and exploitation of girls and women was wild, sexy and aspirational. It was always grotesque that fans bought into it. Musicians have been let off the hook for far too long.

Spare a thought for Amazon’s staff, not Bezos and his billions

Call me hard-hearted, but I couldn’t care less about the quality of Jeff Bezos’s life. His workers are another matter.

Bezos is partly stepping down from the day-to-day running of Amazon. He’ll still be involved in some capacity, but he will also have time to pursue other interests, including the Washington Post (purchased in 2013) and space exploration. Ooh, the same as Elon Musk! Just what is it about male multibillionaires and feeling an urge to point enormous phallic rockets at the sky?

Bezos may be wanting to duck out of forthcoming investigations into Amazon’s business practices or maybe he just fancies kicking back and having a softcore midlife crisis. Good luck to him. On the other hand, Bezos has proved consistently allergic to Amazon paying rightful amounts of tax. His record with small businesses isn’t the greatest. Then there are the relentless issues with pay, hours and working conditions for Amazon staff .

Is Bezos still accountable for Amazon’s problems as well as its successes? It seems he is and not just because he still owns a significant share of the company. Coco Chanel was wrong – you can be “too rich”, at least if you wish to fly completely under the ethical radar. Bill Gates seems to have become aware of this, especially in recent years. At a certain point of mega-wealth, you become a moral disgrace if you aren’t seen putting conspicuous effort into giving back – or just paying taxes.

In this context, Bezos wandering off in his yoga pants to ponder the meaning of existence, solve the mysteries of the solar system and alarm innocent journalists by being more available for editorial meetings comes across as rather grating. Most of us use Amazon, so it would be hypocritical to fully slam the Bezos business model. However, as our online champ downsizes and de-stresses, let’s not forget some of the messes he left behind.

No wonder Matt Hancock was inspired by a disaster movie

It could be a sign of the times that Matt Hancock’s admission about how Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film Contagion influenced the UK’s vaccine strategy has not caused much more of a furore.

Hancock said that watching Contagion made him realise that there would be a global rush for the vaccine and “ huge row about the order of priority”. Hence, the health secretary decided to ensure that Britain would be first in the queue, after which, one presumes, he fetched some popcorn from the kitchen and treated himself to a viewing of Tenet.

In fairness to Hancock, he made it very clear that Contagion wasn’t his main source of scientific inquiry. He also noted that Contagion had employed top epidemiologists who went to great pains to be accurate. However, disaster movies, even good ones, shouldn’t feature in any way in official government pandemic strategy. And while the epidemiologists should be respected, most films of Contagion’s nature would ensure they hired experts for the “science bits”.

Above all, Matt, dude, seriously, it’s a movie, not a Sage briefing. And why are you even talking about this? Maybe it’s only the second worst news that Hancock used Contagion as part of his vaccine strategy. The worst thing is that he was dumb enough to admit it in public.

['Simon Tisdall'],https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/myanmar-china-russia-bad-guys-winning-stand-up,[],"From the coup in Myanmar to the autocratic regimes of China and Russia, western values are under increasing threat",[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"Blame Joe Biden for not stepping in more quickly, or Donald Trump for encouraging authoritarian rulers. Blame Barack Obama for lifting sanctions. Easier still, blame China for propping up a military junta and putting profit before people.

The International Court of Justice warned of ongoing genocide, but nobody was saved. UN security council members argued endlessly about what to do. The finger of blame also points at Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel heroine turned sellout.

Yet while recriminations over last week’s coup in Myanmar may be inevitable, they are beside the point. The issue now is what is the international community going to do about it? The quick answer, based on recent precedents, is not a lot.

This dilemma not only applies to Myanmar. Across the world, to put it crudely, the bad guys are winning. The coup is another landmark in what David Miliband, a former UK foreign secretary, calls the “age of impunity”.

It’s true the US has set an unusually bad example. In November Aung San Suu Kyi won a clear election victory. Myanmar’s army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, alleged fraud. Peddling a lie and ignoring the constitution, he plotted to overturn the vote by force.

Sound familiar? In Washington on Monday, Trump faces trial for a similar, albeit failed, insurrection. Yet such a reckoning is a democratic rarity. Public protests are growing in Myanmar. So is repression. Who will bring Min Aung Hlaing to justice?

It’s also true China is playing a cynical game. It denies backing the coup, which is plausible. Its huge investments require stability, not a return to pre-2011 pro-democracy agitation. Yet China will be the winner if the west reverts to punitive sanctions. This outcome would render the generals triply damned: hated at home, ostracised abroad, and more dependent than ever on Xi Jinping.

The coup is seen by some as the first big test of Biden’s commitment to global democracy. Analyst Azeem Ibrahim claims a US-China deal is possible.

“The US could recognise Beijing’s commercial interests … in exchange for China’s support for forcing Myanmar into humanely resolving the Rohingya crisis and entrenching the power of the [pro-Beijing] democratic forces in the country,” he suggested.

This scenario was optimistic, Ibrahim conceded. China pays only lip service to democracy – witness its crackdown in Hong Kong. It obstructed efforts to punish the generals for genocidal attacks on Rohingya Muslims in 2016-17 which killed thousands and forced three-quarters of a million to flee to Bangladesh.

Xi, too, stands accused of genocide – in Xinjiang – yet appears untouchable. Who will bring China’s bullyboy president to justice?

The same question might be asked of Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin. The “underpants poisoner” is impunity personified. The sheer brazenness of the bungled bid to murder opposition activist Alexei Navalny was matched by his unjust incarceration last week.

Putin has ignored resulting international uproar. He ignores nationwide street demonstrations, which have brought mass arrests. He ignores Russia’s own laws. Yet his effrontery is no surprise.

After invading Georgia in 2008 Putin realised he could get away with almost anything. The lesson was reinforced when he annexed Crimea in 2014 and intervened in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. He even tried to subvert US elections – and got a free pass from Trump.

At home, even more so, he does what he likes, however corruptly. He and his billionaire cronies shrug off western sanctions as badges of honour. Ordinary Russians suffer, but Putin? He thinks he’s immune.

Can domestic opponents and western governments do anything to shake this sickening complacency in the Navalny case? As the Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko showed last autumn, modern authoritarian regimes that control the streets, the courts, the media and the narrative can survive almost indefinitely.

Putin and his ilk bank on the absence of collective international political willpower. If Germany were to cancel Gazprom’s lucrative Nord Stream 2 Baltic pipeline, it would hurt and embarrass Putin. Yet Angela Merkel just won’t do it – and the EU will not insist. Principles are all very well. But money and power talk louder.

Biden’s criticisms have been brusquely rejected by Moscow. So what should he do? Speaking on Friday, he again demanded Navalny’s release and threatened to impose “costs” on Russia – but did not say how or what.

Some in the US believe Navalny, by shaming Putin, has already won a moral victory. But commentator Garry Kasparov insists there must be “real consequences”.

Biden should “rally the free world to finally stand up to Putin’s dictatorship”, starting with asset seizures of eight close associates identified by Navalny. This, Kasparov wrote, would mark the dawn of “a new order for democracy”.

Unlikely. It’s clear that, overall, Biden and the west increasingly lack leverage when faced, not by foreign governments responsive to normal pressures, but by gangster regimes protecting their selfish interests. Mobsters such as North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad come to mind. Who will bring them to justice?

Even where mis-governance is not endemic, there are signs of a broader deterioration. Just look at the mass killings now taking place in northern Ethiopia. They are barely reported, let alone curbed. It’s as though the world’s democracies lack sufficient bandwidth.

Impunity is spreading, non-accountability goes viral. Authoritarianism is the new normal. According to the latest Economist survey, only 8.4% of the world’s population live in a fully functioning democracy, while more than a third live under authoritarian rule – and it’s getting worse.

Even when western politicians try hard to induce dictators and coup-leaders to mend their ways, they usually end up fighting a losing battle. Today’s question is not “who lost Myanmar?” It’s “has the west lost?”",The world’s bad guys are winning. Is anyone going to stand up to them?
['Gene Marks'],https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/07/two-tax-credits-covid-stimulus,[],Don’t miss out on these provisions of the bill passed in December in addition to the paycheck protection program,[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"While a lot of attention has been given to the recent renewal of the paycheck protection program, there are two tax credits included in last December’s Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act that may actually be more valuable for many small businesses. Why?

Because the PPP is a forgivable loan that’s only available to certain businesses, whereas the employee retention tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit are both potential cash payments that are available to a greater number of small businesses.

Interested? You should be. Because if your business is still in operation but has been at least partially affected by Covid, then you’re probably eligible.

To be eligible for the employee retention tax credit in the first or second quarter of 2021 you must first show that your business had fewer than 500 full-time-equivalent employees and was either partially or fully shut down due to Covid restrictions. Even if you don’t match the shutdown requirements you can still qualify by demonstrating that your revenues (defined as total sales, net of returns and allowances) declined in either quarter by more than 20% compared with the same quarter in 2019 (employers that did not exist in 2019 can use the corresponding quarter in 2020 to measure the decline in their gross receipts).

That threshold is lower than what is required to access PPP funds, which requires showing a 25% reduction in revenues. Assuming you qualify, you may be surprised at just how much money you’ll save. So here’s how you will figure that out.

The first step will be to calculate the payroll taxes owed – like you usually do – for the quarter on your federal quarterly reporting form 941. You take 70% of each of your employees’ wages – whether they were working or furloughed and this includes health benefits – paid up to $10,000 that quarter. So the maximum credit for the first two quarters of 2021 is $7,000 per employee per quarter.

This is not a loan. There is no forgiveness

Now, go back to your form 941 and deduct – or credit – that amount against the Fica (the 6.2% social security tax) liability your company owes. Because this is a “refundable” tax credit if you owe less money than the amount of the credit you can get the money returned to you in cash. This is not a loan. There is no forgiveness. There’s no additional paperwork other than completing the federal form 941 which you, your payroll company or your accountant already does.

Can you still claim the credit and participate in the paycheck protection program? Sure. As long as the wages you’re using in the credit calculation are separate from the wages you’re using to calculate the PPP loan and its forgiveness. In other words, no double dipping.

The employee retention tax credit isn’t new. It began with the March 2020 Cares Act and employers can still go back and retroactively claim a credit for that year. But the bar to qualify is higher for 2020 and the amount of the credit is less. Thanks to the more recent stimulus bill, the requirements for the first two quarters have been loosened so it’s become easier and more lucrative.

Pretty great, right? Well, that’s not all. There’s another lucrative tax credit that every small business owner should know about. It’s called the work opportunity tax credit. This is also a refundable credit and was extended through 2025.

This credit is completely separate from the employee retention tax credit. That credit was for retaining employees. The work opportunity tax credit encourages you to hire employees. But not just any kind of employee. This credit is for small businesses who hire certain veterans, people off of welfare or out of prison and rehab and – most importantly – those that have been “long-term” unemployed. Long-term is defined as more than six months and we all know that this recession has created a lot of those kinds of workers.

If you hire someone that fits those criteria then you can get a refundable credit of anywhere between $1,200 and $9,600 (yes, $9,600) against the income taxes you owe this year. This credit is per employee so the amount may be even higher if you bring on additional people that qualify. If an employee is included for the work opportunity tax credit, their wages are not allowed to also be included for purposes of calculating the employee retention tax credit. Again, no double dipping.

Combined, both the employee retention and work opportunity tax credits can result in a big cash incentive for many small businesses, particularly for those that may not even qualify for another round of PPP. The only caveat I have is that calculating both credits isn’t easy or intuitive because, well, it’s the IRS, isn’t it? So you probably want to engage a professional accountant to help. But your returns for doing this should well exceed your costs – particularly the costs of leaving money on the table in a year when every dollar counts.",Two tax credits in the Covid stimulus could save your business thousands

Liverpool’s usually commanding keeper gifted Pep Guardiola’s side two goals in three minutes when, with the game balanced at 1-1, two dreadful clearances straight to City players were converted by Ilkay Gündogan and Raheem Sterling. Phil Foden, outstanding when switched to the right of a 4-4-2 in the second half, struck a superb fourth to seal a victory that takes the leaders 10 points clear of the champions having played one game fewer. It was City’s first win at Anfield since 2003 and the first time Liverpool have suffered three consecutive home league defeats since 1963.

Klopp said of Alisson: “I spoke to him a few seconds ago and he’s obviously very disappointed. He was like: ‘Not today, not today.’ I said to him that’s the problem with mistakes, you cannot decide when you make them. The only thing you can do is learn from them and he will. He will make sure it never happens to him again. Tonight it was decisive, but that’s OK. He saved our lives I don’t know how often. He’s an absolutely world-class goalie. Tonight some things went a little bit wrong and we have to take that.”

The Liverpool manager was at a loss to comprehend the Brazil international’s errors, although in an interview with Sky said: “There is not a real explanation. Maybe he had cold feet? It sounds funny but it could be.”

Klopp later added: “I said to him: ‘We have stands, you can shoot the ball there.’ It’s a mistake, but different things came together. In the first half Ali played exceptional football and was really calm on the ball, passed it in small spaces, exactly what we wanted him to do. Then in the beginning of the second half he didn’t do that. He didn’t see the offers because we didn’t make them in the right way, and then the problem is that he doesn’t shoot the ball somewhere far away from the danger spots. I can’t help him through tonight but tomorrow he will be OK and we will go again.”

Guardiola insisted his first win at Anfield with City would not have a decisive influence on the title, despite his leaders recording a 14th successive win in all competitions and opening a five-point lead with a game in hand on Manchester United. “I’m not a guy who can predict the future but in February five points is nothing,” he said. “We celebrate this win tonight and tomorrow we keep our feet on the grass and prepare for Swansea. I know how difficult that will be and then it is Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal. So many tough games in the next weeks. We need to be calm and keep going.”

The City manager, however, was effusive in his praise of his players’ mentality, particularly their reaction to Gündogan’s first-half penalty miss, and the contribution of Foden.

“In the first half we struggled to find him a lot because he was not in the position he should be,” he said. “When playing in the middle he sometimes has difficulty understanding where he needs to be and where he needs to move, but right now he is moving perfectly on the sides as a winger. The second and fourth goal were outstanding, phenomenal. We cannot forget he is only 20 years old and has an incredible margin to improve. He is always focused and has the feeling he can always do something when he is close to the box. We are lucky. For Manchester City fans to have a player who loves Manchester City, who grew up in our academy, was a ballboy for us, supported us, and has become a top, top football player is a joy.”",Klopp cannot explain Alisson's howlers for Liverpool in Manchester City loss

Kai Havertz was absent through injury and Timo Werner’s drought extended to 14 league games but their less costly compatriot Antonio Rüdiger became the first player to score against Tuchel’s Chelsea with a comical own goal.

Meanwhile, Mount overshadowed big buys to become the first player operating in the new manager’s front three to find the net for him and the youngest man to register 10 Premier League goals for Chelsea since Arjen Robben. The willing Werner’s only goal in three months came against Morecambe but he contributed to both strikes against Chris Wilder’s team and almost scored himself. He ended the evening in credit.

A supportive Tuchel said: “He was decisive. A brilliant run for the first goal and it was great decision making for the second goal. When he plays like this we are happy.”

Werner’s emotions were more mixed. “I am happy with two assists but as a striker you want to score,” he said. “It has been a long time and I have not had this long without [a goal] in my career.”

Every game can add to his anguish. Werner spurned an early opportunity. Mateo Kovacic released him with a long pass, Werner had the assurance to dink a finish over the onrushing Aaron Ramsdale but his shot lacked sufficient power; Chris Basham materialised behind the goalkeeper to make a terrific interception.

It was, it seemed, the first of two goal-line clearances from the valiant Basham, a symbol of Sheffield United’s resistance as they made life awkward for Chelsea. He popped up again when Kean Bryan misplaced a back-pass, Werner raced on to it and into Ramsdale, his knee colliding with the goalkeeper’s face when the ball was nearer Basham than either. The referee, Kevin Friend, was initially unconvinced there was foul play but reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor and gave the penalty.

“I was shocked it was not given straight away,” Werner said. “In the future, maybe I can take a penalty.” Jorginho has been preferred to him for the spot-kick duties and reverted to his technique of a hop, skip and a jump to send Ramsdale the wrong way.

While the goalkeeper, who was then assessed by United’s doctors and deemed fine to continue, seemed a candidate to become the first player replaced by a concussion substitute in the Premier League, the damage came to United’s fortunes. They had parity for 70 seconds before the penalty was awarded. Oli McBurnie had looked for Oliver Burke. Rüdiger had not noticed Édouard Mendy had left his line and poked the ball past the goalkeeper to end his run of clean sheets under Tuchel. “Still no goal from opponent; we did it ourselves,” said the manager.

“We were lucky not to concede first,” Tuchel admitted. United were awarded a penalty for Ben Chilwell’s tug on Basham, only for VAR to rule the latter was offside. They had precious little of the ball but managed to threaten in the first minute, when Burke shot into the side netting, and the 95th, when Mendy excelled to claw away Billy Sharp’s overhead kick.

“They had about £500m-£1bn of quality to call on,” rued Wilder; in contrast, a manager who was aggrieved the board did not heed his suggestions for January signings only named six substitutes. “Quite decent, them players, aren’t they? They punish when you open the door for them.”

He lamented the manner of the goals but otherwise his side defended valiantly. Werner troubled them from his berth as an inside-left. United were unlocked by the German’s acceleration for the opener. He reached the byline to meet Chilwell’s pass, supplied a cutback and Mount picked out the far corner with expert precision.

Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers earned his third Associated Press Most Valuable Player award, while Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald took his third top defensive player prize at NFL Honors.

Also taking home awards were two members of the Washington Football Team: quarterback Alex Smith was the Comeback Player of the Year in one of the most inspirational stories of 2020, and edge rusher Chase Young got the top defensive rookie.

Titans 2,000-yard rusher Derrick Henry won Offensive Player of the Year, and the offensive rookie honor went to Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. Cleveland’s Kevin Stefanski was the Coach of the Year, and Buffalo offensive coordinator Brian Daboll earned assistant coach honors.

Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson won the Walter Payton Man of the Year award for his work in the community.

Rodgers had perhaps the best season of his 16-year career, leading Green Bay to a 13-3 regular season, the NFC’s best mark. Just a few months after questions arose about his comfort level with the Packers – and their choosing a quarterback in the first round of April’s draft – Rodgers, who turned 37 in December, tore up the NFL.

Rodgers topped the league with 48 touchdown passes completion rate (70.7 percent), and a 121.5 rating. He was picked off just five times.

“It is really special to have won it in my fourth year as a starter and now to win it in my 13th year as a starter in a new offense is pretty amazing and something I am very proud of,” Rodgers said. “To have sustained success and be able to play your best football at 37 in my 16th season is something I take a lot of pride in.”

Donald, the Los Angeles Rams’ unanimous All-Pro, added the 2020 top defensive player honor to his wins in 2017 and 2018. Only Pro Football Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor (1981, ’82, 86) and Houston edge rusher JJ Watt (2012, ’14, 15) have earned the award three times.

“You just named two great defensive players,” he said, “so any time your name is mentioned with greats, you will be honored – especially there’s only a few that have accomplished that. To be the third to do it that is truly a blessing. It shows the body of work that I have; anytime your hard work is rewarded you are going to be happy about that. It is just a blessing.”

The 36-year-old Smith completed a remarkable comeback from a broken right leg that required 17 surgeries to repair. Smith stepped in to start eight games before a strained right calf in the same leg sidelined him for the postseason spot he helped the team secure.

Everyone across the league cited Smith as an inspiration.

“It is humbling when I hear that,” Smith said. “I know for how long I spent thinking about and looking at the men and women who inspired me. I am stuck in the hospital bed, stuck in a wheelchair, spent countless hours googling and looking at videos of our service men and women going through the same rehab as I went through. ...

“So there were definitely people in front of me that I am so thankful for that allowed me to go down this path. And obviously I am humbled and I guess you hope that you can kind of be a link in that chain for anybody coming behind you.”

Henry ran for 2,027 yards, the eighth player to surpass the magic 2,000 mark.

“Two thousand yards is always on a running back’s mind, especially in the league because it is so unique,” Henry said. “Always put the team goals first, then individual goals come second. But I knew we take a lot of pride in the running game and have had success, and then anything is possible with the group I am with, (so) we could accomplish it.”

Stefanski’s Browns snapped their postseason drought dating back to the 2003 season by going 11-5 in the rugged AFC North, then beating Pittsburgh in the wild-card round before a close loss at Kansas City.

“We never concerned ourselves with the past, we are all about moving forward,” Stefanski said. “This season had its unique challenges and we focused on those each and every day and ultimately tried to put together a group of guys that would fight every single week, and I think we did that. But we were so focused on what we were doing in the here and now.”

Daboll helped Buffalo to a 15-4 record and a spot in the AFC championship game as he oversaw the rapid development of quarterback Josh Allen in his third pro season. Only Green Bay with 509 scored more than Buffalo’s 501 points.

Herbert, chosen sixth overall in last April’s draft, is the second straight quarterback and the ninth since 2004 to be the top offensive rookie. Not even a starter when the season began, Herbert stepped in during the Chargers’ second game when Tyrod Taylor was injured during a medical procedure. Herbert never looked back, and set a rookie record with 31 TD passes.

“I think it is a testament to all the hard work we have put in as a team, the coaching staff and the players,” Herbert said. “It’s been a tough year, but we put in a lot of good work, but just to be in the conversation (for the award) is an honor.”

Young was drafted four spots ahead of Herbert. The edge rusher led all rookies with seven and a half sacks and should be an anchor of the team’s defense throughout the decade.

“I came in eager to just work hard and be a sponge,” Young said, “and I watched coach (Jack) Del Rio and (head coach Ron) Rivera just from afar, and always just tried to pick their minds about football in general. And I feel like that helped me throughout the year.”

Wilson invoked the words of Payton in his acceptance speech.

“We are stronger together than we are alone...” Wilson said. “To the young boy or girl who has a dream ... who wants to make a difference ... remember: Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

“Love changes things.”

Manning leads Hall of Fame class

Peyton Manning is heading to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, an all-but-preordained honor for a quarterback who helped redefine offense in the 21st century.

The Colts and Broncos QB held or shared 12 NFL passing records when he retired in 2015 after winning his second Super Bowl title. One of those records – his 55 touchdown passes in 2013 – still stands as the league’s single-season record.

His five MVP awards have also not been matched, and his 71,940 yards and 539 touchdown passes have only been surpassed by Tom Brady and Drew Brees.

Manning spent his first 14 years in Indianapolis, where he won his first Super Bowl. Then, after a series of delicate neck surgeries, he made a comeback in Denver.

If Tom Brady lifts Tampa Bay to a win in the Super Bowl on Sunday, he would join Manning as the only other quarterback to lead two franchises to a championship.

Manning’s was the final name announced for the hall on the NFL Honors awards show Saturday night.

“I have respect for everyone else really because everyone has a right and freedom to choose how they want to express themselves and what they want to do.

He tells our writer why the British Museum is now in his sights,[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"Mwazulu Diyabanza makes no secret of why he is in France. If coronavirus had not closed most of Europe’s museums, the Congolese activist would probably be inside one right now, wresting African objects from their displays to highlight what he sees as the mass pillaging of the continent by European colonialists.

And it’s not just the mighty museums. Diyabanza and his supporters also plan to include smaller galleries, private collections and auction houses in their campaign. “Wherever the riches of our heritage and culture have been stolen,” says the 42-year-old, “we will intervene.” As the leader of a pan-African movement called Yanka Nku (Unity, Dignity and Courage), Diyabanza is on a mission is to recover all works of art and culture taken from Africa to Europe. He calls his method “active diplomacy”.

We will be looking at Spain, Germany, Portugal, the Vatican and – yes – the UK Mwazulu Diyabanza

Last June, in between French lockdowns, Diyabanza and several others entered the Quai Branly museum in Paris, which has around 70,000 objects from sub-Saharan Africa. Shouting “We’re taking it home!”, they wrenched from its setting a 19th-century African funeral post that belonged to the Bari people of Chad. Police recovered the object and held Diyabanza in custody for three days. A judge fined him €1,000 for “attempted theft”.

A month later, in Marseille, Diyabanza attempted to remove an ivory spear from the Museum of African, Oceanian and Native American Art. He was let off in court. Then, come autumn, he was in the Netherlands attempting to remove a Congolese statue from the Afrika Museum at Berg en Dal. He was given a two-month suspended sentence and a €250 fine.

“The prosecutor had wanted me convicted to discourage others,” says Diyabanza over the phone. “But the judge recognised that I was not guilty of ‘theft’ but of a political act. He opened the door to discussions with the museum authorities. So I’m going back to the Netherlands with the idea of discussing this.”

Although further actions were planned this month in Brussels, they have been thwarted by Covid-19 closures. But more are in the diary. “We will be looking at Spain, Germany, Portugal, the Vatican and – yes – the UK,” he says. “We will be visiting the British Museum once it reopens. It contains some chef d’oeuvres that are very symbolic.”

On its website, the British Museum admits that some objects in its Africa collections have “difficult histories, including the contested means by which some collections have been acquired, such as through military action”. It adds: “The British Museum is actively engaged in re-examining the acquisition histories of such collections and caring for them with appropriate respect, in close dialogue with African partners.”

The 900 objects from the Kingdom of Benin, now southern Nigeria, are particularly problematic. They include exhibits that were looted from Benin City by a British military force in 1897, most famous among them the mesmerising Benin bronzes, created from the 16th century onwards by specialist guilds. “The Royal Palace was burned and destroyed,” the museum’s website explains. “Its shrines and associated compounds were looted by British forces, and thousands of objects of ceremonial and ritual value were taken to the UK as official ‘spoils of war’, or distributed among members of the expedition according to their rank.”

Diyabanza, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now spends his time in France and Togo, says talk is fine – but action is needed. He estimates that in France alone there are 116,000 African objects that should be returned. In November 2017, during a speech in Mauritania, French president Emmanuel Macron promised to return African works housed in French national museums. Since then, only 27 restitutions have been announced and only one object repatriated: a sword that had belonged to Omar Saidou Tall, a West African political leader, Islamic scholar and warlord.

Diyabanza has now widened his campaign with the creation of the FMAS, the Front Multiculturel Anti Spoliation, or the Multicultural Front against Pillaging. This aims to reunite people across the globe with what he calls their robbed heritage. These include artefacts belonging to Native American tribes, aborigines and indigenous peoples of the Philippines, Indonesia, Peru and elsewhere.

“We have to give a voice to these people,” he says, “and push them to join our action so we can pressure western governments to return everything. This restitution must be immediate and unconditional and carried out with dignity and respect – and it must happen everywhere in Europe. The museums and institutions of these countries must understand that we are determined.

“For the moment, we are concentrating on museums. We are optimistic governments will eventually cooperate. Then we will ask people who have objects in private collections to act with goodwill and return the things that have been stolen from us. But, eventually, it’s not just our artefacts but our land and our riches: the minerals, diamonds and gold; the animals, flora and fauna. And reparations – but that is another campaign.”

Diyabanza is not concerned if his movement leaves many European museums practically empty. He has described the removal of art and cultural objects from Africa between 1880 and 1960 as a “vast operation of theft and pillaging that came just after Africa suffered one of the greatest crimes against humanity: slavery”. He is not opposed to African and other objects being displayed in Europe. But he wants to see them returned first and then they can be lent on their owners’ terms.

“These museums are guilty of receiving stolen goods,” he says. “Perhaps they can be decolonised and give birth to something new.The current health restrictions mean our popular actions are restricted. But we have to continue so we can rebuild our own cultural heritage. These are our objects and we want them back.”",'We want our riches back' – the African activist taking treasures from Europe's museums

His 2017 debut mixtape was called Get Rich Or Get Recalled; on his 2019 album, Third Avenue, he had the braggadocio to call a track Money Maker. But after a few pop misfires – namely a 2020 single called Hickory Dickory Dock – Fredo has reached the conclusion that wealth is not the answer, and that authenticity is paramount.

The City of Tears opens, as did its predecessor, The Burning Chambers, with a prologue set in 19th-century South Africa, a foreshadowing of where this epic story of war and displacement will end up, before the narrative returns to 16th-century France, 10 years after the end of the previous book. Minou Joubert and Piet Reydon are living in relative peace in their castle in south-west France, their own family and estates an example of how Catholics and Protestants can amicably coexist. It’s an experiment soon to be imposed on the whole country, as the queen mother, Catherine de Medici, attempts to broker peace by marrying her Catholic daughter Margot to the Huguenot Henri of Navarre, a union opposed by the hardline Catholic faction led by the Duke of Guise. As Minou and Piet make their preparations to visit Paris for the wedding, she asks her brother Aimeric about rumours of trouble.

“‘It is hard to separate truth from untruth,” Aimeric conceded, “but there is no doubt Guise wants unrest. He thrives on it. Though he is careful never to speak out of turn, I do not trust him. He gives one message in public from his own mouth, but yet whips up his supporters in anti-Huguenot sentiments in private.”

Fake news, propaganda and leaders whipping up a mob against the government are nothing new; frequently, the novel offers uncanny echoes of current headlines. The Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacre of 1572 that followed that ill-advised wedding, when thousands of Protestants were murdered in their homes by Catholic troops, in Paris and across France, has been a favourite subject for novelists and film-makers, but Mosse conjures the chaos and fear of those days with fresh urgency, as Minou and her family scramble to escape the slaughter.

Mosse’s focus in her historical fiction has always been on the untold stories of women and Minou is an appealing heroine, tough and resourceful, holding her family together through unbearable losses and more than once saving her husband’s life through cunning or physical courage. The author’s great skill is to weave extensive research with the conventions of the adventure novel; her villains are enjoyably villainous, her heroines at once exceptional and vulnerably human.

She includes all the ingredients you would expect from a historical epic – murder, treachery, lost children, stolen relics, buried secrets – but she also dramatises the complexities of 16th-century French and Dutch politics, unfamiliar to many English readers, without weighing it down. This is a compelling story of how great political upheavals play out in individual lives and how unexpectedly anyone can find themselves seeking sanctuary and the kindness of strangers.

Part music video, part call to arms, this Manchester international festival event follows on from last year’s album of the same name, which likened the UK’s increasing hostility to immigrants to an abusive relationship, and an accompanying short film that envisaged a shocking near-future reality.

Originally broadcast last December from a deserted and supposedly haunted San Francisco theatre, the performance begins with an illusion of spontaneity – Ahmed sharing his pre-show backstage rituals – but gradually reveals a carefully choreographed mix of spoken-word poetry, storytelling and striking visuals accompanied by thrilling hip-hop beats, including a hard-hitting rendition of album highlight Toba Tek Singh. Ahmed is a magnetic presence: his prodigious wordplay and rapping prowess combine in a high-octane performance brimming with righteous anger that brings to mind Childish Gambino’s This Is America.

Starting with the disturbing implications behind the question “Where are you really from?”, Ahmed dissects themes of home and belonging, the toxic legacy of empire and Covid’s devastating effect on communities of colour (“killed by corona or the crown, different track, same dance”). The ideas come thick and fast, from his ancestors’ contributions to British society – tea, the paisley pattern, even swastikas – to reflections about his relatives’ personal experience: a candlelit section about his grandfather being forced to leave India in 1947 is chilling.

All the while, Ahmed questions his own artistic process, the role of the audience (the aim is not, he says, to “entertain you with our tragedies”) and the powerlessness of words in bringing about change. Whether the bleak future he predicts will come to pass or not is still to be seen. But for now, this is the kind of raw, affecting work that can guide us in the right direction.

As Michael Sherwin, acting US attorney for Washington DC which is leading the hunt, has put it: “The scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably DoJ history.”

David Gomez, a former FBI national security executive who spent years countering domestic terrorism, told the Guardian that the bureau would classify and handle the search as a “major case”.

“It is probably one of the largest investigations since 9/11,” he said.

Already the number of people who have been arrested, either by the FBI, Capitol police or local Washington DC officers has reached 235, spanning more than 40 states. As the investigation widens and deepens, the focus is tightening on anyone considered to have acted as a coordinator of the action in an attempt to take out the ringleaders.

The FBI has set up a special strike force of experienced federal prosecutors who have been given the express instruction to pursue aggressive sedition and conspiracy charges. So far at least 26 people have been charged with conspiracy or assault.

“Sedition is the most serious crime that anybody could be accused of from 6 January,” Gomez said. “It’s advocating the overthrow of the US government. It involves not just talking about overthrowing democracy but having the means and wherewithal to carry out those actions.”

As more has become known about those arrested, the strategy being pursued by the FBI has also revealed itself. In several cases, people who participated in the storming of the Capitol were picked up and charged with relatively minor offenses such as trespassing or theft of mail simply as a means to get them into prosecutorial clutches.

Once in the system, more serious charges could then be added as intelligence came in. That pattern of escalating charges can be seen in the cases of Nicholas DeCarlo from Texas and Nicholas Ochs from Hawaii.

Initially, the pair were accused of unlawful entry into federal property. But new conspiracy charges were added this week in which they are alleged to have planned out their travel across state lines, raised money to pay for it, and then made the trip to Washington DC in a premeditated attempt to obstruct the certification of Joe Biden as winner of the US presidential election.

If convicted, DeCarlo and Ochs each face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Prosecutors have made clear that they are ramping up the charges against select individuals as a means of discouraging further violence from Trump supporters and their far-right and white supremacist allies. “We are going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent, because regardless of if it was just a trespass in the Capitol or someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found,” Sherwin said.

The FBI’s work has been greatly assisted by the plethora of intelligence swirling around online – in many cases posted by the suspects themselves. Take the hapless duo, DeCarlo and Ochs.

A photo of the pair, posing thumbs up in front of the memorial door of the US Capitol on which they had scrawled the words “MURDER THE MEDIA”, was easily found online. It has been included in the indictment against them, and earned them the special attentions of the media assault strike force set up by federal prosecutors to investigate violent threats against members of the media.

That photo is one of at least 200,000 digital media tips that have poured into the FBI from across the country, some coming from friends and even family members who recognized individual rioters from the profusion of video and stills footage plastered across the internet and promptly informed on them.

As federal agents work their way through this mountain of digital information they are starting to get a feel for the kinds of people who were present that fateful day on the Hill. As feared, the leadership role played by far-right and white supremacist groups has veered into sight.

At least 10 members of the extremist group the Proud Boys are among the mounting number of those arrested, including Ochs, who according to the justice department claims to have founded a Honolulu chapter of the network. This week’s Washington state arrest was also of a self-declared Proud Boys leader – Ethan Nordean calls himself “sergeant of arms” of the Seattle chapter and is accused in court documents of having led a group of rioters into the Capitol.

On the back of mounting evidence of the Proud Boys’ leadership role in the attack, the Canadian government this week moved to designate the group as a terrorist organization.

Meanwhile, several members of the Oath Keepers, one of the largest far-right militia groups in the US, have also been arrested.

Another chilling element emerging from the indictments is the number of current and former law enforcement officers and military personnel who are among them. An analysis of the first 150 people to be arrested by CNN found that at least 21 had military experience, some ongoing.

Of those, eight were former marines, underlining the danger of elite military training designed to defend the country from international threats being turned back on itself and used to attack the heart of US democracy at home.

At least four law enforcement officers who were actively serving in their positions at the time of the 6 January attack have been accused, and have left their jobs. They include a Houston, Texas, police officer and a corrections officer from New Jersey.

One of the emerging truths that FBI detectives and prosecutors will have to wrestle with is that, despite the substantial presence of white supremacists and military personnel, most of those who have been arrested are what might be described as unremarkable Americans with no previous criminal records or history of extremist behavior.

Political scientists at the University of Chicago who studied the profiles of arrestees and published their conclusions in the Atlantic found that many were middle-class and middle-aged – with an average age of 40. Almost 90% of them had no known links with militant groups. Some 40% were business owners or with white-collar jobs, and they came from relatively lucrative backgrounds as “CEOs, shop owners, doctors, lawyers, IT specialists, and accountants”.

The one common denominator uniting this large group is not any extremist group, website or media outlet, but an individual – Donald Trump. This is why the connection between the pending impeachment trial and the ongoing FBI roundup of suspects is so critical.

The link has been made overtly in the defense cases being compiled by lawyers on behalf of several of the arrested rioters. Take Jacob Chansley from Arizona, the self-styled “QAnon Shaman” who went shirtless and wore a furry headdress with horns as he battled as far as the Senate dais during the Capitol assault.

His lawyers have offered him up as a witness during Trump’s trial. They say Chansley, who faces six charges including civil disorder, used to be “horrendously smitten” by Trump but now feels betrayed by him. They are also likely to use the argument that Chansley was misled by the then US president as a central argument in his own defense.

But Gomez is doubtful that the ploy will prove effective.

“I don’t think that’s going to hold water in federal court,” Gomez said. “‘I only robbed that bank because somebody told me to do it’ – I’ve never heard that line working for any crime.”",Seditionaries: FBI net closes on Maga mob that stormed the Capitol
['Gabrielle Canon'],https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/06/california-highway-1-landslide-climate-crisis,[],"The iconic coastal road has a history of landslides, and experts say ‘it would not be surprising’ to see them happening more frequently",[''],en,2021-02-06 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"California’s Highway 1 has been ruptured by a landslide that is expected to keep 23 miles of the iconic road snaking through the state’s rugged coastal cliffs closed for months.

A severe winter rain storm last week caused a 150ft fissure along the picturesque thoroughfare tucked against Big Sur, with concrete, trees and mud falling into the sea below.

It’s not the first time. Landslides have been a longstanding feature of Highway 1. And with climate change and a deluge in tourism and traffic overwhelming both infrastructure and environmental ecosystems in the coastal region, the problems are only expected to get worse.

Highway 1 was deemed California’s first official scenic highway when it opened in 1937. The road stretches across more than 656 miles through the state, but is most known for the sections along California’s central coast, where millions of tourists each year admire the pristine and wild terrain where the mountains meet the Pacific.

It’s rumored the highway has never been fully operational from north to south for more than a year since its inauguration, with the elements that give it its world renown also spelling its doom.

With its steep slopes and diverse geology, the area has always been a site of cliffside churn, said Gary Griggs, a coastal erosion expert at University of California Santa Cruz. “This is not new, and it is not a surprise,” he added.

Caught between rising tides and crumbling cliff sides, maintaining the highway has become somewhat of a sisyphean task. Millions have been poured into the projects, with evidence of past engineering successes and failures etched into the concrete. There are bumps of new asphalt alongside snaking cracks, signs of repair and disrepair, as the process is repeated again and again.

“It all costs money,” Griggs said. “And, well, it is a tough road to repair.”

Griggs was called in to consult in 2017, when the Mud Creek slide covered a quarter-mile of the highway and ceded 15 acres of land to the sea. That rebuild took more than a year to complete, and cost roughly $54m.

Last week’s slide was roughly 165 miles south of San Francisco, and was probably caused by the disastrous environmental combination of a record-breaking fire season followed by big winter storms.

The slide took place just south of where the Dolan fire tore through roughly 125,000 acres last year. The burn scar from the months-long fire, with its blackened sand and sparse vegetation, made for slippery terrain, especially on the steep cliff sides along the coast. Then came the rain.

A so-called atmospheric river, a flowing column of condensed water vapor that spills severe amounts of rain or snow when it makes landfall, flooded the region, dropping 16 inches of rainfall – nearly double the amount the area has seen for the entire month on average. The soil was unable to absorb that amount of cascading water, causing mud and debris to flow, ultimately blocking and then overwhelming a drainage pipe under the highway.

“Landslides have been a historic feature of Highway 1 along the Big Sur coast,” said Kevin Drabinski, a spokesperson for California’s department of transportation (Caltrans). “But this storm was very large scale and left significant damage in its path.”

While the chasm that tore apart the road was the most dramatic scene of devastation, Drabinski added that 60 other locations along the highway were also damaged or blocked by debris.

Severe weather combinations like the one that occurred last week are no longer an anomaly. They fall in line with climate crisis trends and models marked by hot dry summers, bigger fires and long periods of drought peppered by intense rainstorms that cause floods and landslides.

“There is no question that climate change is occurring,” said Griggs, the coastal scientist. “It would not be surprising to see this happening more frequently.”

It’s not just fires, rain and landslides that threaten Highway 1 – parts are also being ravaged by the sea. Farther north at Gleason beach in Sonoma county, Caltrans has given up on preserving the route and has instead opted to build new sections farther inland. Smashed seawalls – remnants of attempts to buy more time against the encroaching waves – already line the shore. The state sank millions into emergency restorations as the coastline continued to erode by roughly 14 inches on average each year.

The $73m project could be an indication of what’s to come. By some worst-case scientific projections, sea levels could rise more than 9ft in California by the end of this century.

“It has always been a fragile environment fraught with concern and problems,” said Lesley Ewing, a senior coastal engineer with the California Coastal Commission, of Highway 1. “The roadway is crumbling because the ocean is just eating away at the cliffs.”

She sees opportunities where researchers and officials can be proactive in anticipating problems rather than waiting to react to them, including pushing parts of the highway farther from the eroding shore. However, that’s not an option everywhere.

Meanwhile, residents living along the famed road in the Big Sur area have been forced to adapt. “We have been through this many times before,” said Kate Novoa, a former lawyer who has lived on Big Sur’s largely undeveloped south coast and now runs a blog called Big Sur Kate.

“I have backups to my backups,” she said. “The way most of us live down here, is we are prepared to be isolated for an entire winter.” Novoa has cupboards full of dried and canned food. She runs her home on solar, and has not one, but two backup generators. There’s extra propane and lots of firewood.

“I have become more adept at what I need to do,” she said. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. Still, she thinks it’s worth it.

Even as conditions worsen and new dangers arise, Novoa said there was a reason why she and others in her community have chosen to adapt rather than move. “Most of us who live up here would never trade it for town,” she said. “It is one of the most beautiful places on the planet. It is very isolated and it is not for everybody – but I am never going to leave.”",California’s famed Highway 1 collapsed last week. It’s sure to happen again

The departures of McNeil and audio journalist, Andy Mills, a co-creator of the Daily podcast and a producer and co-host of the now partially retracted Caliphate podcast, come amid a wider reckoning across over racism and abusive behavior within American newsrooms.

Mills’ departure, unlike McNeil’s, also follows a major journalistic failure: the revelation that a central source in the Times’ award-winning Caliphate podcast about the Islamic State, who had offered lurid audio testimony about his supposed role in Isis executions, may have been a fabulist who had duped the Times with claims that could not be independently corroborated.

The fallout from the collapse of Caliphate had sparked renewed public allegations about Mills’ past inappropriate and hostile behavior towards female colleagues, including a public apology from Radiolab, one of Mills’ former employers, for not doing enough to address his treatment of other journalists.

In letters on Friday afternoon, McNeil took responsibility for his behavior and apologized for hurting his colleagues and the paper’s reputation, while Mills defended himself, writing that he had “been transformed into a symbol of larger societal evils” and that his “actual shortcomings and past mistakes were replaced with gross exaggerations and baseless claims”.

In both cases, the Times had faced pressure from its own journalists, as well as from external critics, including a coalition of major public radio stations, to hold the men accountable for their behavior.

Following allegations of McNeil’s conduct when he had used the N-word in front of high school students on a 2019 trip to Peru, the paper initially investigated and said he had been disciplined, “but that it did not appear ... his intentions were hateful or malicious”, the paper reported.

That response was strongly criticized in a letter by more than 150 New York Times staffers who said that despite its “seeming commitment to diversity and inclusion … we have given a prominent platform – a critical beat covering a pandemic disproportionately affecting people of color – to someone who chose to use language that is offensive and unacceptable by any newsroom’s standards”.

Six students or parents on the trip had complained about the comments, the Daily Beast reported.

In his apology letter, McNeil said he had repeated the racist slur in response to a question a student had asked him about a video in which a 12-year-old had been suspended from school for using the word. He had originally defended his use of the word in that context. “The fact that I even thought I could defend it itself shows extraordinarily bad judgment,” he wrote. “For that I apologize.”

In memos to staff on Friday, Dean Baquet, the paper’s executive editor, and Joe Kahn, its managing editor, announced the departure of both journalists.

['David Smith'],https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/06/jen-psaki-biden-white-house-press-secretary,[],Psaki is the most prominent face of an administration that has pledged to restore order and trust with the press – but there is also a fast chess game taking place,[''],en,2021-02-06 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,set(),"The blue door at the side of the White House podium slid open. “Hi everyone!” exclaimed Jen Psaki with a congeniality seldom heard in the briefing room in recent years.

The press secretary introduced Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, and stepped away from the podium only to hastily reach back for a face mask she had momentarily forgotten there. Warning reporters that their time with Sullivan was limited, she quipped: “I will be the bad cop as per usual over here.”

“Bad cop” is one of Psaki’s trademark phrases, along with “circle back” and “I don’t have anything more for you”. All are now becoming familiar to cable news viewers at the restored daily White House press briefing. After four madcap years of Donald Trump, the sessions are disorientingly civil, fact-based and unnewsy. In a word, “normal”.

“To actually hear questions and substantive answers is refreshing,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster. “It does feel like something from a different era.”

Psaki is the most prominent public face of a Joe Biden administration that has pledged to restore order and trust with a press castigated by Trump as “the enemy of the people”. Its communications strategy has involved a blitz of speeches, briefings and policy documents, including thrice-weekly virtual sessions with experts on the coronavirus pandemic. Whereas Trump’s White House was a theatre of anarchic improvisation, Biden’s is a set where everyone sticks to the script.

At Thursday’s press briefing, Sullivan previewed Biden’s announcement cutting off support for Saudi military operations in Yemen. Psaki wielding a giant briefing book, reeled off facts and figures about why the president’s $1.9tn Covid relief plan is essential. Then she took questions, starting with the Associated Press, another quietly revived tradition.

For the dozen or so reporters – masked and physically distanced due to coronavirus precautions – sitting in the blue seats of the compact briefing room, the back and forth is crisper than in the Trump era. There is a sense of kinetic energy that was lacking when the president himself could be rambling and soporific and when his press secretaries aimed sound bites mostly at cable news and YouTube.

But there is also a fast chess game taking place, with reporters moving pieces forward in search of a weakness and Psaki marshaling her defenses to dodge questions or avoid a headline-generating gaffe. And when the pressure mounts, she has a queen’s gambit.

She told National Public Radio’s (NPR) humorous Wait Wait … Don’t Tell Me! program last weekend: “I have a little secret thing I do – maybe not secret because I’m telling all of you. But when reporters are getting really loud, or they’re starting to ask crazy questions, I just slow down my pace, and I talk very quietly, and I treat them like I’m an orderly sometimes in an insane asylum.”

But it is not all smooth-sailing.

There was a minor clean-up required this week when Psaki was asked about Trump’s much-mocked space force. The press secretary replied with more than a hint of sarcasm: “Wow. Space force. It’s the plane of today!” – a reference to a past question about the color scheme of Air Force One.

Republicans demanded an apology with the Alabama congressman Mike Rogers fulminating: “It’s concerning to see the Biden administration’s press secretary blatantly diminish an entire branch of our military as the punchline of a joke.” Psaki did not say sorry but did feel compelled to tweet recognition of the space force’s “important work”.

If the 42-year-old from Connecticut is a polished performer, it is because she has deep experience. She was a traveling press secretary for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008, a state department spokesperson and, from 2015 to 2017, White House communications director. She was then a political commentator for CNN and a fellow at Georgetown University in Washington.

Mike McCurry, a former White House press secretary under Bill Clinton, is an acquaintance who has offered Psaki occasional advice such as “keep a good sense of humour” and “don’t let it consume every bit of your life”.

He said: “Two weeks in, she’s doing very well. She’s gives good, complete answers, She’s taken on some tough subjects. She knows how to kind of parry and thrust, as you have to do from the podium, and I think that the press appreciates it. There’s a requisite amount of spin that goes with the job to try to put things in a favorable light for the president but she doesn’t overdo that.”

That could not be said for Psaki’s predecessor, Kayleigh McEnany, who pushed false conspiracy theories about a stolen election and ended each briefing with a tirade against the “fake news” media. Compared to such cartoon villains, as they were perceived by critics, the new team of professional bureaucrats were bound to enjoy a honeymoon period.

Jen Psaki has become must-see TV. I think many people are glued to these press conferences Wendy Schiller

Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “Jen Psaki has become must-see TV. I think many people are glued to these press conferences. They’re longer than they used to be and she’s very good at what she does and, to the extent that she answers questions as truthfully as she can, it’s like being in a rainstorm after a drought.”

Communications strategy is an early case study in the question of whether Trump did change the presidency forever or the White House and other institutions are more resilient than often supposed and able to revert to Bush and Obama-era norms.

Those norms were hardly flawless. All presidents lie, argued Adam Serwer in the Atlantic magazine, providing a list of examples from Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama and concluding that Biden will inevitably lie too when the public interest conflicts with the political interest of the White House. Trump’s narcissistic mendacity was hardly a solution to the problems of political doublespeak, but a snap back to the previous norm of evasiveness and spin may not be it either.

Where the Biden White House will also break from the immediate Trumpian past, Schiller predicted, is by giving a more prominent role to other officials. “Biden has explicitly chosen very experienced politicians for most of his key positions, people who have been in front of cameras before, people who know how to communicate for the most part. He will rely heavily on a lot of those cabinet secretaries to get out his message on particular policies and give them some autonomy and freedom to do that,” Schiller said.

Trump, by contrast, was often said to be his own communications director, press secretary and all-round salesman. He tormented his staff by upending their message of the day with heat-of-the-moment tweets that announced firings, threatened wars and dominated news cycles. But even some detractors admitted that it provided a real-time window on the president’s thinking unlike anything seen before.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There’s no doubt that Donald Trump was a pioneer in the use of social media. He was able to drive the agenda in a way that few presidents have ever been able to do using Twitter.”

Meanwhile Biden generated the headline on the Mashable website: “Joe Biden’s first @POTUS tweet is refreshingly boring.” Indeed, Biden’s conventional tweets lack the personal authenticity not only of Trump but of social media savvy politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Given the president’s history of gaffes, this may be no bad thing, Jacobs added.

“With Biden there’s really no choice because he’s a guy who shares Trump’s problems with agenda control. Biden is only effective as a communicator as long as he’s being handed talking points. When he’s gone off script, it’s been a wild ride. He doesn’t have the communication skills of Trump and he is prone to seat-of-the-pants comments that are damaging.”

The Biden communications team was spared potentially troubling distraction last month when Trump was banned from Twitter, effectively cutting his mic. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, does not miss him. “We didn’t learn anything from Donald Trump’s Twitter feed except that the man was an egomaniacal, hypersensitive petulant child,” he said.

“As president there is a way to use it that doesn’t come off like you’re sitting in your underwear at two in the morning tweeting manically because you just saw something online that that pissed you off.”",Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki has embraced normalcy – is it working?

Fifty-three years later the 91-year-old San Diego man has it back along with mementoes of his 13-month assignment as a US navy meteorologist on Antarctica in the 1960s.

“I was just blown away,” Grisham told the San Diego Union-Tribune after the wallet was returned on Saturday. “There was a long series of people involved who tracked me down and ran me to ground.”

The wallet contained his navy ID card, driving licence, a pocket reference card on what to do during atomic, biological and chemical attack, a beer ration punch card, a tax withholding statement and receipts for money orders sent to his wife.

Grisham, who was raised in Douglas, Arizona, enlisted in the navy in 1948. He became a weather technician and then a weather forecaster. In 1967 he was sent to Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze, which supported civilian scientists. At the time he was in his 30s and married with two toddlers.

“I went down there kicking and screaming,” he told the Union-Tribune. At some point he lost the wallet, something he later forgot about. It was found behind a locker in 2014 during demolition of a building at McMurdo station on Ross Island. But finding its owner still took emails, Facebook messages and letters exchanged among a group of amateur sleuths.

Stephen Decato and his daughter Sarah Lindbergh, both of New Hampshire, and Bruce McKee of the Indiana Spirit of ’45 nonprofit foundation had previously worked to return a navy service ID bracelet to its owner. Decato had also worked for an agency that does research in Antarctica. His former boss, George Blaisdell, heard about the bracelet episode and decided to send Decato two wallets found during the McMurdo demolition. Lindbergh found Grisham through the Naval Weather Service Association. The second wallet was returned to the family of a man who died in 2016.

Grisham told the Union-Tribune it is hard to grasp the vastness and remoteness of Antarctica. A luxury was a daily after-work martini, and once a week he contacted his wife, Wilma, by voice relay through shortwave radio operators. Grisham retired from the navy in 1977.

Florida has been hit harder by the pandemic than nearly any other state and the crisis has wreaked havoc on countless lives, families and communities from the Florida Keys to the Panhandle – and everywhere in between.

The state experienced the second most unemployment claims in the US since the start of the pandemic, with an unemployment increase of 1,683% compared with January last year, according to data compiled by WalletHub.

Florida has recorded over 1.6m cases and more than 25,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, the third highest case count among states in the US and fourth in total deaths, although its population, at nearly 22 million, is the third largest.

Workers who have lost their jobs have been forced to rely on a broken state unemployment system that has experienced long delays, backlogs, system crashes and small payments as the state’s maximum payout of $275 covers only a portion of the lost income for thousands of workers in the state.

Through 2020, Florida was the second worst state in the US at paying unemployment benefits on time. Internal audits had uncovered various issues with the state’s unemployment system for years before the pandemic hit, and elected officials are still conducting reviews on how to fix the state’s ongoing unemployment failures.

The Guardian spoke to workers in Florida who have struggled to survive while relying on the state’s broken unemployment system.

Here are some of their stories.

Ann Largent

Former hotel employee at Disney World in Orlando for two years

Right before coronavirus shut down Orlando’s tourism industry, Largent was separated from her job of two years at a Walt Disney World hotel, where she worked late-night shifts conducting maintenance and housekeeping duties.

Orlando, one of the most visited tourist destinations in the US before the pandemic, has taken among the hardest hits in job losses as its theme parks, Disney World, SeaWorld, Universal Studios, and others have permanently laid off thousands of workers.

The surrounding area has maintained the highest unemployment rates in the state, with an estimated 125,000 jobs lost over 2020.

Largent was one of thousands of Floridians who experienced long delays in receiving unemployment benefits through the state. During that time, Largent and her daughter had to leave the house they rented because they could no longer afford it. They moved into a mobile trailer park where they currently reside because rent is too high anywhere elsenearby.

“During that time frame, I lost everything,” said Largent. “Covid-19 has destroyed my life.”

Her car was rear-ended by a truck while she awaited unemployment, and because the driver had no car insurance, she hasn’t been able to repair the damage. Her own car insurance expired last month because she can no longer afford the payments. That puts her driver’s license at risk, which she needs not only in hopes of finding a job, but for taking her 12-year-old daughter, who is currently in remission from cancer, to doctor’s appointments.

I lost my health insurance because Medicaid said I was making too much money on unemployment. I only get $247 a week

Shortly after she finally started to receive unemployment benefits, her Snap food assistance benefits were cut from $355 a month to $16 a month. Then the federal extended benefits of $600 a week expired on 26 July, leaving Largent and her daughter to survive on just $247 a week, Florida’s maximum unemployment payout after taxes are deducted.

After submitting hundreds of job applications, she finally received an offer to start work as a patient care technician at a nursing home, but after working one day was never provided a full schedule.

Her unemployment benefits were stopped due to a hold placed on her account for working one day. It took a month for Florida’s department of economic opportunity to remove the hold after weeks of Largent calling for help, spending hours on hold trying to speak with service representatives. While her benefits were on hold, she fell behind on rent.

Largent also experienced her own health issues while trying to survive on unemployment.

“I lost my health insurance because Medicaid said I was making too much money on unemployment. I only get $247 a week. How am I making too much in unemployment? All that pays is my rent,” she said.

The health insurance difficulties occurred while Largent required medical attention after she was bitten by a black widow spider on her ankle, and almost lost her foot as a result.

Her daughter has struggled through the pandemic, in transitioning to a new, smaller home, struggling with virtual learning and worrying about catching the coronavirus as a cancer survivor with a compromised immune system.

Largent explained her daughter’s personality had changed due to the lockdown, from very outgoing and talkative to quiet, reserved and shy.

Delaun Stokes

Former server at Macaroni Grill in Orlando for two years

Stokes worked as a server at Macaroni Grill at Orlando international airport for two years before the coronavirus hit the US and he lost his job.

In March, Stokes explained everything started to change suddenly. First tables were cut and spread out to socially distance customers. The next week, Stokes and his colleagues were informed the restaurant was going to be shut down, and he would be furloughed until things returned to normal.

By August, his restaurant was still shut and he received a letter informing him that his furlough would be a permanent layoff by 15 October.

It went from keeping myself afloat, paying bills, to wondering where I’m going to get my next meal

He received unemployment benefits right away unlike thousands in Florida but things got much more difficult when the extra $600 a week of federal extended benefits expired on 26 July.

“It went from keeping myself afloat, paying bills, to wondering where I’m going to get my next meal, if I’m going to have enough to pay rent or use what little I had to get food that week, trying to juggle things around got hard,” Stokes said. “The coronavirus relief hasn’t been enough, so we need something more. For the elected officials who are fighting for it, I thank them from the bottom of my heart. For the ones who oppose it, all I have to say is we’ll see you guys next election day.”

His mother and stepfather moved out of the area during the pandemic to follow work in audio engineering, so he’s spent the duration of the pandemic without the support system of a family nearby.

Stokes and several of his colleagues at Orlando airport have held protests to push local elected officials to pass legislation to ensure workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic are provided recall rights to return to their jobs when their workplaces reopen.

“We need assurances to make sure we can go back to our jobs. It’s only fair and it stops us from having to worry about what’s going to happen next,” Stokes added.

Maria E Gonzalez

Former cashier at Sbarro in Orlando for four years

On 26 March, Gonzalez’s manager at Sbarro pizza assured her the furloughs would be temporary only to receive a letter five months later announcing her layoff would be permanent by 15 October.

She’s had several problems with Florida’s unemployment system since she first applied for benefits.

When Gonzalez first applied, her application was delayed because she was required to provide her birth certificate after the Florida department of economic opportunity requested further documentation to verify her identity.

I call unemployment every single day for the benefits. I’m told they don’t know when I’m going to receive them again

In August, Gonzalez worked a temporary job organizing in support of the Biden campaign in Florida, but her job was discontinued after two days because the organization was experiencing technical issues.

“I reported this to unemployment and they’ve kept me on hold for months, and I’m still on hold five months later,” said Gonzalez. “I call unemployment every single day for the benefits. I’m told they don’t know when I’m going to receive them again, they don’t have a time frame, just that they’re fixing it. They said they owe me a lot of money, but they still haven’t given it to me, so I’m having to depend on friends and family to help me with bills because I’ve been behind.”

On a daily basis, Gonzalez is harassed by calls from creditors demanding payment, but because of her ongoing hold with unemployment, she’s been unable to pay her bills. Even when she manages to work something out with a service agent for a creditor to defer pay for a month or two, she still receives calls demanding payment while late fees and interest are piling up.

“I’m frustrated. I’m depressed,” said Gonzalez. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in my future, even in the next month. I don’t know what to do.”

Williams Alvarez

Cargo worker at Miami international airport for 10 years

For 10 years, Alvarez, an immigrant from Cuba, worked as a cargo employee for the contractor Eulen America at Miami international airport.

When coronavirus began spreading around the US in March, Williams noted there was immense pressure at work, as personal protective equipment shortages were widespread, and there were ongoing rumors workers would be laid off.

On 23 March, Williams received his layoff notice and has tried to survive on unemployment ever since.

Like thousands of Americans who were suddenly laid off or furloughed, Williams spent every day for weeks trying to call and log on to unemployment to process his application, but the phone lines were always busy and the website kept crashing.

After six weeks, he started receiving benefits, but continued trying to help co-workers secure theirs. During the wait, his bills began piling up, and he’s been behind ever since.

It’s already been almost a year and I constantly feel like I’m drowning, raising my hand for help, but being ignored

“My car broke down, but I’ve only been able to afford to get part of it fixed,” said Williams. “I broke my tooth and had other dental issues, including an infection as a result of dental problems. My uncle passed away, and afterwards responsibilities of caring for my aunt and my mom fell on to me and that’s made it really difficult for me to try to get ahead.”

When the federal unemployment benefits of $600 a week expired on 26 July, Williams started falling further behind. He managed to work out a payment plan for his car and mortgage to defer payments for six months, but this February he is expected to restart payments.

With the new presidential administration coming in, Williams has some hope things will improve and future coronavirus relief packages will focus on helping the working class and frontline workers.

“This whole pandemic has physically and mentally impacted me. I’m frustrated. I want things to change, but things aren’t changing. It’s already been almost a year and I constantly feel like I’m drowning, raising my hand for help, but being ignored,” he concluded.

Guevara was shocked when she received a layoff notice on 23 March. For weeks in March there was a lot of insecurity and anxiety about coronavirus, but she had the most seniority in her department, a spotless record, was a backup supervisor, but was the first person laid off in cargo.

“I felt like the roof fell in on my head. I’m diabetic, we were already living through this feeling of anxiety because no one was telling us at work what was going to happen with the pandemic, and then I asked myself, what was I going to do without any money?” Guevara said. “I felt humiliated and betrayed. My co-workers and I gave the best of ourselves so we could make American Airlines and other airlines look good, so to me it was a betrayal, a stab in the back.”

In October, a congressional subcommittee released a report on various airline contractors who misused coronavirus relief funds, as delays in the disbursement of funds allowed contractors to conduct mass layoffs, then subsequently keep payroll relief funds for pre-pandemic jobs.

The politicians don’t have any idea what’s happening, their salaries keep coming

It took nearly three months before Guevara started receiving unemployment benefits. She relied on former co-workers and friends to help pay for her diabetes medication, food and other bills. She applied for Snap benefits and began applying for other jobs, even though her health issues make her particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus infection.

Shortly after she started receiving unemployment benefits, the extra $600 a week of federal extended benefits expired, leaving her with just $1,000 a month in income to cover her rent of $1,575, her medications which cost $400 a month even with reduced costs through a clinic, and for food and other bills.

“The politicians don’t have any idea what’s happening, their salaries keep coming. Meanwhile, the average worker, we earn every dollar through our sweat. And either way, life is invaluable. That money helped us stay home and protect ourselves from the pandemic,” Guevara added.

Ramona, 65, and her husband have relied on food banks throughout the pandemic. Their diet has primarily consisted of rice and beans, or whatever food they could afford.

“We haven’t been able to eat like we used to eat before. We can’t go out to eat. We can’t buy meat because it’s so expensive,” she said.

When she first lost her job in March, it took about two months to start receiving unemployment benefits after struggling to process her application, and she never received back pay for the weeks of benefits she missed.

She receives $500 a month in social security benefits, most of which goes toward her health insurance. While waiting on unemployment, she fell behind on mortgage payments for her mobile home, but managed to get an extension until May 2021. She has no idea how she will pay the back payments she owes.

The money we do get immediately goes right back out to pay off bills

“I haven’t been able to pay the mortgage. I’m behind on my credit card bills and my utility bills. I don’t know what I’m going to do right now because it’s been extremely difficult finding work. I’ve been looking everywhere, applying for jobs,” Ramona said.

It’s been even more difficult trying to find a new job at her age, and she’s frequently tried to get a job at nearby Walmart stores despite the ongoing risks of coronavirus. Her hopes heading into 2021 are to find a new job so she can afford to survive and to eventually pay off the $106,000 mortgage on her home, which she was paying for three years before the coronavirus hit.

“Being without work, and little money coming in, there are a lot of bills and it’s frustrating because there’s no help coming from anywhere. The money we do get immediately goes right back out to pay off bills,” she added. “I’m hoping the mortgage lender gives me some kind of payment plan because right now I can’t pay back the money I owe. They told me I have to pay $7,000 when the extension ends. No way I can pay that.”

“I believe integrity comes from the top down,” he told the Guardian from a hotel room in Brisbane, where he and his wife, Sandra Price, are quarantining after his expulsion.

“I want to show people that it’s possible to do the right thing.”

Ahluwalia said he was determined to continue to serve the university, and his primary obligation remained to his students.

“This university has provided an education for many of our current and future leaders.”

More than a dozen police and immigration officers raided the vice-chancellor’s on-campus home just before midnight on Wednesday, a move that USP staff and student associations labelled “gestapo tactics” and “un-Pasifika behaviour … in violation of human rights and due process”.

Ahluwalia and his wife were given only minutes to pack and then driven at high speed in a three-car convoy to Nadi, where they were held incommunicado until they were placed – under police guard – on to a flight to Brisbane.

They were deported on the orders of Fiji’s immigration minister and prime minister, Frank Bainimarama. Ahluwalia’s conduct, his deportation notice said, was “prejudicial to peace, defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public health, security, or good government of the Fiji islands”. The Fiji government claimed unspecified “repeated breaches” of the immigration act and visa conditions.

Ahluwalia has angered the Fijian government over an internal report he wrote in 2019 – that was subsequently leaked – detailing allegations of widespread financial mismanagement within the university, abuse of entitlements, unearned promotions and millions of dollars improperly spent under former administrations seen as closely allied, politically, to the Bainimarama government.

Ahluwalia retains the support of a majority of the USP council. Samoa quickly stated it would be willing to host the university headquarters if Fiji refused to allow Ahluwalia to return.

Staff, students, Fiji’s Law Society, all non-governing parties in parliament and several NGOs have condemned the summary deportation. They have demanded, unsuccessfully, that the government share whatever evidence it has against the two.

The USP Students Association on Friday called for a large-scale turnout on campus for a peaceful protest. It encouraged participants to wear blue, the colour of the university’s logo.

“I was deeply moved by the image of USP staff and students holding a prayer service for me,” Ahluwalia said. “Just talking to you about it right now is making me feel emotional.”

Ahluwalia, who holds Australian and Canadian citizenships, said his recent deportation was the culmination of numerous difficulties he and his wife had faced since March 2019 when he submitted his initial report.

In September of 2019 the independent auditor BDO Auckland published a subsequent damning report largely vindicating Ahluwalia. Some of Ahluwalia’s specific allegations were not possible to verify “due to the level and/or quality of documentation retained by the USP”, it found. The BDO report – also leaked publicly – stated that concerns about financial irregularities had been raised during three consecutive audits and were still unaddressed.

Since submitting his initial report, Ahluwalia said, his understanding of the scope of the problem had only increased. “With what I know today, I could probably write four or five reports,” he said.

“I believe integrity comes from the top down. I want to show people that it’s possible to do the right thing. And I’ve been hiring people who feel the same. They need to know that it’s expected that they act properly.

“This may be difficult for a western audience to understand, but the people I work with are deeply spiritual and devout. That’s a bond that I share with them.”

For decades the University of the South Pacific has been a shining light in the region, and where the best and brightest from all across the islands have studied. Collectively owned by 12 Pacific states – with campuses in all – the university has produced generations of regional leaders, and been the crucible of pan-Pacific political movements on independence and democratisation.

But allegations of mismanagement have damaged its reputation, and Ahluwalia was appointed in 2019 with a mandate to modernise and reform the institution. His frank reportage of the university’s problems, however, has angered Fiji’s government.

Fiji’s deportation of Ahluwalia has accelerated discussion that USP’s senior administrative functions should be decentralised from the Laucala campus headquarters in Fiji. For several years other Pacific states had grown concerned Fiji was seeking to nationalise a university expressly established as a regional institution.

Ahluwalia said he and his wife planned to use their fortnight of quarantine to reflect on their experience, and on the way forward. “I believe this is all part of God’s plan.”",'Integrity comes from the top down': whistleblower vice-chancellor vows to fight on despite exile from Fiji

The Metropolitan police have enacted additional stop-and-search powers and beefed up patrols after the series of incidents in the capital, believed to be unconnected, which left two young men dead, a 16-year-old critically ill in hospital and 11 others wounded.

One of the two fatalities was named on Sunday as Sven Badzak, who died in hospital after being stabbed while walking with a 16-year-old friend in Kilburn, north-west London, at about 5.30pm on Saturday.

His mother, Jasna Badzak, a former Conservative activist, shared pictures on Twitter of her son, as a child, with Boris Johnson, David Cameron and George Osborne, and appealed to the prime minister, former prime minister and former chancellor to intervene in the case.

She told the MyLondon website her son had gone out to the shops to pick up some orange juice and was the “nicest of nice kids”, adding: “He was the most polite boy you could possibly imagine. The perfect manners … He was beloved by everybody.”

Ch Insp Darren Jones of Scotland Yard said: “At this early stage we believe Sven and his friend became involved in an altercation with a group of males. As this group chased the pair, Sven and his friend became separated. Sven fell to the ground and was attacked by a number of the group.

“His friend was also attacked but managed to seek sanctuary in a shop – however, he remains critically ill in hospital.”

The weekend’s violence began on Friday evening, when five stabbings were reported in just over three hours in south London, leaving one man dead and nine people injured.

No arrests have been made after a 22-year-old man died in an altercation with a group of males at a property in Croydon. One neighbour told PA Media she saw police and medical staff trying to save a heavily bleeding young man. The victim’s mother showed up “crying and in pieces”, the witness said.

Elsewhere in Croydon, two people were arrested after a man in his 40s was found with a stab wound at an address on Dingwall Road. The victim was later arrested on suspicion of affray and a 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

Police said none of the nine other casualties from the five incidents was considered to be in a life-threatening condition.

At about 11.20am on Saturday officers were called to reports of a fight in Coulsdon, south London, where a man in his 20s had been stabbed and was taken to hospital. Two men have been arrested. Then shortly after 3pm police were called to a stabbing of a 24-year-old near West Croydon station.

Scotland Yard said more officers had been deployed in response to the violence. Sarah Jones, the MP for Croydon Central and Labour’s shadow policing minister, said it was an “incredibly unusual and sad situation with so many incidents in 24 hours, but they are all unconnected and people can rest assured the police are doing what is required”.

The stabbings came as the Home Office commits £35.5m to help violence reduction units, which support projects that carry out preventative work with children and young people, to battle the “horrors” of physical attacks.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, said: “Violence reduction units play a vital role in preventing young people from being dragged into the horrors of serious violence, and this funding will enable them to continue this crucial work. I will continue to back our police with the resources and powers they need to cut crime and make your community safer.”",Police name stabbing victim after weekend of attacks in London

US billionaires vie to make space the next business frontier Read more

The United Arab Emirates’ probe Hope orbiter will arrive first, on Tuesday, followed by China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft the next day. Finally, the US rover Perseverance will make its dramatic descent to the surface of Mars on 18 February.

It is a remarkable armada that reveals the growing desire of many nations to develop their own space technology and explore the solar system. Just how well they succeed when they reach their target this week and next remains to be seen, however. Mars is an unforgiving place to visit.

Of the dozens of Mars missions since 1960, about half have crashed or missed the planet altogether, thanks to component failures, rocket engine mishaps or software errors.

“It can be a heartbreaking business,” admitted UK physicist Colin Wilson, of Oxford University. “I have had instruments on two previous Mars missions – Britain’s Beagle lander and Europe’s Schiaparelli probe – and each time I was in the control room, clutching my seat, during their descents. And on both occasions the probes crashed.”

Mars is a difficult destination for several reasons. First, it is millions of miles away, astrobiologist Susanne Schwenzer of the Open University pointed out. “It is not like going to the moon which is only a quarter of million miles distant. That is the equivalent of a putt in a game of golf. By contrast, Mars is incredibly distant. In golf terms it is the equivalent of a full tee-shot and a lot trickier.”

In addition, Mars has an atmosphere but not a thick one. “That means there is enough air to trigger dust storms and winds that sheer and push your lander off course and into danger,” added Wilson. “On the other hand, it is not thick enough to allow you to use parachutes for a probe’s entire descent.”

In the past, US space engineers have relied on fitting airbags to their probes allowing them to bounce to a standstill after being dropped from a parachute. However, Nasa’s new generation of rovers are too complex and heavy for such manoeuvres and Perseverance will instead rely on a rocket platform called a sky crane to lower it to the Martian surface.

This technique was used once before, in 2012, to land the US rover Curiosity. Now Perseverance, a much heavier rover, will follow suit on a journey that has been dubbed Nasa’s “seven minutes of terror”. That is the time the SUV-sized rover, which weighs more than a tonne, will take to reach the surface of Mars after striking the planet’s upper atmosphere at more than 13,000mph.

Atmospheric friction will bring about the first cut in speed. Then a huge parachute will be released automatically and this will cut the probe’s speed to a few hundred miles an hour. Then the sky crane’s rocket engines will fire and the probe will slow down until it hovers about 20 metres above the surface of the red planet.

The crane will lower the rover on cables until it touches the surface, the cables will be cut and the sky crane will fly off to make its own uncontrolled landing a safe distance from Perseverance. Only then will a message be relayed to Nasa engineers to let them know the good news.

By contrast, the UAE’s spaceship Hope, the Arab world’s first interplanetary spacecraft, will have a relatively simple time this week. It is designed merely to orbit Mars, which it will achieve by carrying out a 30-minute burn of its main engine.

If the burn is successful that will slow the spaceship sufficiently for it to be captured by Mars’ gravitational field and enter orbit round it. Hope will then spend the next two years studying Mars to better understand how, over billions of years, it lost a thick atmosphere that was capable of sustaining water vapour on its surface but which was slowly transformed into a cold and arid world.

China’s Tianwen-1 is also scheduled to enter Martian orbit this week. It will study the planet for several months before dropping a lander that will carry a 250kg robot rover on to the planet. If it works, China will become only the second nation in the world to successfully land a robot vehicle on another world, after the US.

“China has already safely landed rovers on the moon, but this will be a far greater achievement and will really show what their space scientists can do today,” said Schwenzer.

Crucially, the three probes form part of a spearhead of missions that in coming years should transform our knowledge of the planet, by returning Martian rock and soil samples to Earth for study. This task will be started by Perseverance, which is scheduled to pinpoint promising geological sites, extract soil samples and leave caches of them at selected locations. Future missions, involving Europe and the US, will then retrieve these samples and return them to Earth.

“When we do that, we will hopefully get answers to the simple question: is there, or was there, life on Mars,” added Schwenzer.

“It is a crucial issue – for if life did evolve on Mars, independently of life on Earth, that means life evolved twice, separately, in the same solar system and is likely to be common in the cosmos.”

The other is the country’s president of two decades, a former KGB colonel who appears determined to stay in power and to smash a popular revolt against him.

On the face of things, the struggle ended last week with a decisive victory for Vladimir Putin. Navalny was sentenced to two years and eight months in a penal colony. On Friday, he was in court again charged with insulting a war veteran. More criminal cases are likely, with Navalny now in effect a hostage of Putin’s authoritarian regime.

But the Kremlin has been unable to do what it wants most: to break Navalny. His decision to return and to face prison refutes Putin’s thesis on Russian politics, that anyone who wants to remove him is corrupt or too weak to be trusted. Navalny’s principled stand has left Putin looking small, grasping and ridiculous by contrast. Not exactly Vladimir the Great, as Navalny said in a speech from inside his aquarium-like glass cage, but “Vladimir the Poisoner of Underpants”.

For years, the Kremlin has vacillated about what to do with Navalny, whose anti-corruption videos and investigative exposes have given him a mass following. Ignore, jail, or use other, more shadowy methods? The obvious ones didn’t work. He shrugged off repeated threats and arrests. Finally, Navalny alleges, an exasperated Putin gave an order to have him silenced.

Last summer, an undercover team from Russia’s FSB spy agency poisoned Navalny while he was touring Siberia. They applied the nerve agent novichok – used against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury – to the inner seams of Navalny’s underpants. Navalny survived thanks to a mixture of luck and timely hospital treatment. He even managed to expose his FSB assassins.

The Kremlin apparently calculated that Navalny would not dare to return home from Berlin, where he recuperated. On 17 January, however, Navalny flew back to Moscow, in a direct challenge to Putin. His detention on arrival triggered street protests all across Russia – in 180 towns and cities, from occupied Crimea to Vladivostok on the Pacific. In Yakutsk protesters gathered in temperatures of -50C.

Tens of thousands of Russians have rallied in support of Navalny, seeing in him the best prospect of change following a period of declining living standards, increasingly blatant repression and top-level thieving.

This backing is by no means universal. But it amounts to the most serious challenge yet to Putin, who appears increasingly out of touch and cut off.

“Navalny is probably not a saintly person,” Vladislav, a 24-year-old club sound engineer said, as he protested last month on Moscow’s Pushkin Square. “But compared to what’s happening now, to what’s happening in the administrations of cities across the country, to the stealing, it would be a lot better if he was in charge.” Nearby, other young demonstrators stood ankle deep in snow, many smoking e-cigarettes and joking with friends.

“Nobody should be in jail for his political ideas,” Nastya, a 22-year-old protester with bright pink hair, added, as riot police surged into the crowd and carted off several students. “The main thing is not to be afraid and to come out. Of course I’m scared. I’m scared of being arrested. I’d be letting down a lot of people around me. But being scared is worse.”

The authorities have responded to what they say are “illegal” gatherings with batons and violence. Riot police have arrested well over 10,000 people. Moscow detention centres are overflowing; with too few cells available demonstrators are being held for hours in freezing police vans. Journalists have been targeted. Some have been beaten. A prominent editor was jailed for 25 days just for retweeting a meme.

In his speech to the court Navalny pointed out the absurdity of the Kremlin’s case against him. (He is accused, among other violations, of being slow to inform parole officers that he was in a coma in Germany.) Navalny said he was behind bars because of “one man’s hatred and fear”: “I mortally offended him by surviving an attempt at my life he ordered.” Putin – or “grand-dad”, as Navalny likes to call him – was a “thieving little man in a bunker”.

A lawyer by training, and a fan of the cartoon sitcom Rick and Morty, Navalny comes from a different world than the grey bureaucratic realm inhabited by Putin and his KGB friends. The Russian state has powerful tools at its disposal: a large, loyal security apparatus; compliant judges and prosecutors; and glossy state television networks that reliably serve up anti-Navalny smears and propaganda.

But Navalny has weapons of his own. One is humour: an unrivalled ability to mock the country’s corrupt neo-feudal rulers in ways that ordinary Russians can understand. No one quite gets under Putin’s skin the way Navalny does. The other is a lack of fear: a David versus Goliath bravery, according to Vladimir Ashurkov, the London-based director of Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation.

“Navalny is in a different dimension to Putin,” Ashurkov explained. “I’m amazed at the breadth of his interests. He dabbles in many things. He used to hate jogging but took it up and routinely runs 5-10 kilometres. He taught himself Python [progamming]. He likes good TV. He’s a fun guy.” Asked how Navalny would bear up in prison, he said: “He’s a tough cookie.”

Leonid Volkov, a Navalny aide based in Lithuania, said Navalny’s determination to face down Putin was “quite rational”. “He’s always capable of seeing the big picture. He knows the Russian opposition is historically destined to win. We are younger, smarter than they are. Our movement is based on truth and human rights, and the proposition that two plus two equals four.”

Volkov said the latest revolt differs from the last big protests of 2011-12, triggered by election fraud. Navalny addressed rallies as an opposition activist. The latest demonstrations feature all social groups; outside Moscow police are unable to cope with the numbers, he said. “Maybe we have to wait. It can happen that Putin will crawl on for another 10 years. But at the end of the day we will prevail,” he predicted. Volkov has now halted the protests until spring, allowing the opposition a chance to regroup and to focus on upcoming elections.

Born in 1976, Navalny is from a generation that grew up in the USSR but was not defined by it. His father, a communist, was an officer in the Soviet missiles forces; Navalny spent his early years on military bases. His grandmother fought in the great patriotic war – as Russians call the second world war – and wrote her name on the wall of the liberated Berlin Reichstag.

The family’s attitude towards Soviet power was ambiguous. His mother had a copy at home of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago; his great-aunt was repressed and sent to the mining town of Vorkuta north of the Arctic circle. At the same time Navalny’s grandmother admired Stalin – describing him as “our everything”, because of his role in defeating Nazism.

It is tempting to compare Navalny to the dissidents and intellectuals of the 1970s who struggled against Leonid Brezhnev and Soviet stagnation. But instead of samizdat – swapped by hand and read in kitchens – Navalny has social media. His latest video on Putin’s secret Black Sea palace has clocked up almost 110 million views. A master of irony and rapier-like sarcasm, he has 2.5 million followers on Twitter.

Navalny first came to prominence as a blogger. He read law, took a course at Moscow’s financial academy and worked as a grassroots organiser for the liberal Yabloko faction. The party kicked him out after he marched in 2007 in Moscow with radical nationalists – a strategy, some think, to broaden the opposition movement’s support beyond a niche middle class.

“He represents a much more serious prospect of change than anything else we have seen in the 21st century,” David Clark, a former special adviser to the late foreign secretary, Robin Cook, suggested.

“He’s a right-wing populist with nationalist leanings. That’s precisely what makes him so dangerous to the Kremlin. It’s not easy to dismiss him as a western puppet. Navalny is an authentically Russian phenomenon.”

Navalny’s supporters disagree with the nationalist label. Volkov described Navalny’s politics as “centre-left”, and said attempts by the regime to portray him as a radical extremist were “horse-shit”. Navalny’s publicly expressed platform has moved toward that of a pro-European democrat – although. he has not renounced his earlier anti-migrant rhetoric. He has called for fair and transparent elections, an independent judiciary and a free media. And a minimum wage for all Russian citizens.

His biggest demand is an end to rampant state corruption, which has seen Putin’s entourage accumulate billions from strategic enterprises. In 2007 Navalny became a shareholder activist, buying stakes in murkily run state firms. He launched various platforms for online civic activism.

In 2013 he ran for mayor of Moscow, winning – despite the usual ballot rigging by the authorities – at least 27% of the vote. And the Kremlin is clearly determined to keep Navalny locked up beyond Duma elections this September. He was poisoned last year while campaigning for “smart voting”, urging Russians to back candidates opposing the ruling United Russia party. This spooked Putin’s administration – as did protests next door in Belarus.

Until recently Russia’s president refused to use Navalny’s name, preferring instead to call him “that gentleman” or “the patient in Berlin”.

Paradoxically, it is the Kremlin’s paranoid behaviour towards Navalny that has made him a household name. Other opposition leaders have been forced out of the country (the former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now in London; the chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who is in Croatia). Or they have been murdered – the fate of Boris Nemtsov, shot dead outside the Kremlin in 2015. Navalny is the last man standing.

Will he be safe in prison? Nobody quite knows. Possibly even Putin has yet to decide. Navalny is grimly aware of the possibilities, pointing out last week that he is now in the hands of people who like smearing chemical weapons over everything. For the moment, the world is watching closely. The US president Joe Biden, and other western leaders, have demanded Navalny’s release.

Navalny’s fate depends on whether he can persuade enough Russians to overcome their fear and to keep protesting, in the face of batons and prison cells.

“The iron doors slam shut behind me with a deafening clang, but I feel like a free man,” he posted last week. “They can hold on to power only by relying on our fear. But we, having overcome fear, can free our homeland from a handful of occupying thieves.”

As the Tampa Bay Buccaneers boarded their buses last Sunday to leave Lambeau Field, where they had just upset the Green Bay Packers to earn a trip to Super Bowl LV, Tom Brady assumed his regular seat across the aisle from quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen.

Even in the age of social distancing, Brady and Christensen are inseparable — two legends laser-focused on the same prize.

“We’re sitting in the back of the bus, and I’m looking up at all these signs saying Title Town and Lambeau Field,” Christensen said. “And our talk as we were driving out was, ‘Why us? How does this happen?’ The playoffs are a time when you gratefully retrospect your life. You think about how we got here, how many people helped us along the way. … How lucky am I?”

In a phone call this week, Brady said: “We sit next to each other on the bus every road game. He and I get a chance to talk about everything that happened in the game. Kind of our little therapy session, win or lose. He’s got great perspective. When I’m sitting there listening, I’m very much — the story isn’t about me — but for him to say, ‘How lucky am I,’ I feel the same way. How lucky am I?”

“Today we honor our three captains

For their actions and impact in

A time of uncertainty and need.

They’ve taken the lead,

Exceeding all expectations and limitations,

Uplifting their communities and neighbors

As leaders, healers and educators.

James has felt the wounds of warfare,

But this warrior still shares

His home with at-risk kids.

Suzie is the ICU nurse manager at a Tampa hospital.

Her chronicles prove that even in tragedy, hope is possible.

She lost her grandmothers to the pandemic,

And fights to save other lives in the ICU battle zone,

Defining the frontline heroes risking their lives for our own.

Let us walk with these warriors,

Charge on with these champions,

And carry forth the call of our captains!

We celebrate them by acting

With courage and compassion,

By doing what is right and just.

For while we honor them today,

It is they who every day honor us.”","Amanda Gorman Super Bowl LV poem: Video, full text"

Shasta in the distance.

As urban areas locked down last spring and people got sick and died from the coronavirus, they felt far removed.

“We had a mindset like, ‘We’re not going to get it. That’s just in the cities,’” said Bravo, 34.

How she wishes that had been true.

Last summer, everyone in the house Bravo shares with eight family members got COVID-19: Bravo, her husband, her 7-year-old twin boys. Her mom and dad. Her two sisters. Her brother.

One sister, 18-year-old Ashley Marin, is believed to be the youngest Tehama County resident hospitalized with the virus, according to the county’s public health department. And her father, David Marin, was hospitalized for 73 days, withering from a sturdy 200 pounds to a skeletal 89 pounds.

Now, the family hopes their story can be a cautionary tale for rural California, where skepticism of the virus’s severity and of the vaccine’s effectiveness runs deep.

“I want to tell people this virus does exist,” David, 56, said from his front porch, his soft voice accompanied by puffs from a portable oxygen tank. “It is true. It is true. You can catch it anywhere.”

The family’s house is just outside Corning, an agricultural town of 7,600 residents about 30 miles northwest of Chico that is called the Olive Capital of the World. In California’s conservative northern counties, public health officials say they have struggled to convince residents that the virus poses a real threat.

Here, schools are open for in-person learning. People still eat inside restaurants, even though that is banned by the state. In public, many do not wear masks. Some in this region, which heavily supported President Trump, thought the virus was a hoax and would go away after the election, health officials say.

“People around here are tough. They don’t want to test or admit they could have it,” said Dr. Richard Wickenheiser, the Tehama County health officer. “They’re concerned about their jobs and their ability to go to work if they get tested. ... They’re used to doing things alone. They say they’ve been through worse.”

The pandemic skepticism in vast, sparsely populated Northern California is emblematic of the mood in small towns across the country, where illness or physical trauma can sometimes mean an hours-long drive to the nearest medical facility.

Rural residents are less concerned that they will get sick with COVID-19 than their urban and suburban counterparts, and they are more vaccine-hesitant, according to a national poll conducted in December by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Half of the rural residents polled said the seriousness of the coronavirus is exaggerated in the news, compared with 37% of suburban and 27% of urban residents.

While distance and low density — natural social distancing, some call it — did cause the virus to spread slower in Northern California than in more densely populated areas farther south, the region has not been immune from a statewide spike in coronavirus cases this winter.

When all nine members of Bravo’s household tested positive in mid-July, Tehama County had reported 121 positive cases and one death, according to The Times coronavirus tracker.

As of Friday, the county of about 65,000 residents had confirmed 4,831 cases and 47 deaths.

Bravo and her family do not know how the coronavirus entered their home.

But the virus’ burden has been disproportionately shouldered by people much like them: essential workers who cannot work from home; people living in multi-generational households; and Latinos, who make up 39% of California’s population and 55% of its COVID cases.

Bravo, an ophthalmology technician, and her husband and sons recently moved into her parents’ three-bedroom mobile home while they build a new house nearby. When she talks about what has been the worst year of her life, Bravo has a hard time holding back tears.

Ashley was the first to feel sick. The high school senior, a former cheerleader, started getting headaches and body aches around July 8, a Wednesday. By Monday, she was gasping for air.

Her parents drove 25 miles, across the Butte County line, to Enloe Medical Center in Chico, where she was admitted directly to the intensive care unit because her oxygen levels had fallen dangerously low.

On Tuesday, the teenager was put on a ventilator. That same day, her father started coughing so hard he could not catch his breath. He too was whisked into the ICU at Enloe — right about the same time county health officials were coming to the family’s home to test them all for the coronavirus.

That Friday, Bravo answered one of many distressing phone calls she would take over the coming weeks: Ashley was not improving, a doctor said.

They needed to make a decision, immediately, about whether to give her a plasma treatment. Bravo and her mom said to do it.

A woman of deep Catholic faith, Bravo got mad at God. Why us? she asked.

But then, she apologized. She begged for a sign that her sister would survive.

At that moment, a flower — a bright pink vinca planted by her mother, Maria Marin — fell at her feet. She took that as her sign.

That Sunday, Maria, 58, who worked as a sorter at an almond orchard, was sitting on the front porch, waiting “in a living hell” for news about Ashley and David, when she started gasping.

Bravo rushed her to Enloe. She was admitted for observation.

“Please,” Bravo pleaded with her mother. “Come back.”

At home, her other sister, Vanessa Marin, 26, was so weak she could barely walk.

Bravo’s young sons showed no symptoms, but Bravo had a cough. Her head pounded.

“I think I just didn’t pay attention to COVID,” she said. “I was so worried about what was going on with my parents and sister and everybody here. I was so scared because my kids came back positive.”

As the family’s ordeal intensified, some people said they must be exaggerating, Bravo said. Others said they too had gotten COVID-19 and that it wasn’t really that bad. The comments stung.

“I’m just like — God bless them,” she said. “I hope they don’t get sick. Other people get sick and say it’s just like the flu. It didn’t happen like that for us. ... I thought we were never going to get it, but it scarred me and it scarred everybody in my family.”

The family’s frontyard became like the hospital waiting room they weren’t allowed to visit. There, Bravo took all the calls from doctors and nurses. Vanessa watched her older sister pacing back and forth from a front window, interpreting the facial expressions and hand motions: good news or bad.

A few days after Ashley’s plasma treatment came good news: her condition had improved. She was released after 18 days in the hospital — eight of them on a ventilator.

Maria was released after eight days of observation.

But David, who was on a ventilator, only declined. At one point, he was scheduled to have his intubation tube removed, but his fever spiked. Blood started coming from his nose, then his mouth. It was from his lungs.

David had always been such a healthy man, Bravo said. A farmworker in the almond orchards who was born in Mexico, he almost never took a day off. He was stoic, someone who would take a Tylenol for just about everything and didn’t go to the doctor often. That he, of all people, would get so ill — it was a shock.

Early the morning of Aug. 6, a nurse called Bravo and said David’s doctors had gone into a meeting and were going to call soon. Gather the family, the nurse said.

That afternoon, as they sat on the front lawn, a doctor who had come from New York told them she had seen numerous cases like David’s. None lived.

“As a medical doctor, I can say there is no hope for your dad,” Bravo recalled her saying. “He will not survive. As a person, I can tell you only a miracle will save your dad.”

A few hours later, they did a Zoom call with David, who was barely conscious. They said goodbye.

“The next day, when we woke up, the house was so quiet,” Bravo said. “I have kids. I expected them to be playing around. No. It was empty without my dad. My sister started crying. I started crying. I said, ‘My dad is going to make it.’”

They went to church and prayed. They were standing outside when the doctor called, shocked: David had stopped bleeding overnight. His fever was gone. He was breathing more on his own.

After 48 days in the ICU — half of them on a ventilator — David was taken to a long-term acute care hospital in Sonoma County, where he spent about a month gaining his strength. His family couldn’t visit his room but would drive more than three hours to spend a few minutes outside his window, waving.

When she first saw him, Bravo did not recognize her father. He had lost half his body weight.

“He is a miracle,” said Alisa Nelson, a registered nurse at the Sonoma County hospital. He was one of her first COVID patients. “To see him progress from coming in on a vent, to literally walking out of the hospital — we don’t see that.”

David said that when he woke up from his coma, he did not know if his youngest daughter had survived. When the nurses told him it was September, he was stunned.

“I’ve been asleep this whole time?” he asked.

At one point, Vanessa made a desperate promise to God: If her father came home, she would shave her long, thick brown hair, which her father adored.

David came home Sept. 25. On Vanessa’s birthday, Sept. 30, David shaved her head. He wept.

More than four months later, David still uses a portable oxygen tank. After weeks on a ventilator, his voice is now a higher pitch, and his laugh is different.

The family has placed chairs all over their property. To rebuild the muscle that withered away, David walks, then rests. Walks, then rests.

Bravo wants to start a foundation, something to get warm food to other local families stricken with COVID. When they were sick, people left meals at the end of their driveway — a perk of living in a small town where word gets around fast.

On her iPhone, she keeps a list of more than four dozen nurses and secretaries who took care of her family. Every day, she prays for each of them by name.

Remembering the vinca that fell at her feet, she says for them the prayer of St. Therese of Lisieux, who died at age 24 from tuberculosis and is called the Little Flower.

O Little Therese of the Child Jesus, please pick for me a rose from the heavenly gardens and send it ... as a message of love.

Ashley is finishing her senior year virtually, even though her school has resumed in-person classes.

She doesn’t leave home much because she doesn’t want to get sick again. She has withdrawn from social media to focus on herself.

She is haunted by the memory of waking up to find her hands restrained so she wouldn’t pull the tube out of her throat. She can still hear the heart monitor beside her bed, its beeps speeding up as she started to panic.

“There are times where I have flashbacks where I’m still in the hospital,” she said. “Sometimes, I’m just staring. Spacing out. I see it. I’m there. Back in the bed again.”

Democrats vehemently disagree.",[''],en,2021-02-07 00:00:00,https://www.latimes.com,,{'Coronavirus and Pandemic'},"Congressional supporters of former President Trump on Sunday denounced his upcoming Senate trial as unfair and unconstitutional, while Democrats argued that holding the ex-president accountable for provoking last month’s Capitol riot is a grave moral and political necessity.

Republicans have declined to defend Trump’s actions, which included directing his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 as then President-elect Biden’s electoral victory was being certified. But in a preview of the trial that is to begin this week, they are mounting a variety of procedural arguments to attack it, including the insistence that the House of Representatives acted too hastily in impeaching Trump just a week after the attack.

They also argue that the Senate doesn’t have the constitutional authority to convict a former president.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), seizing on the speed of the House action, likened the Senate trial to a Stalinist-era proceeding. “If this happened in the Soviet Union, you would call it a show trial,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Even though Senate Republicans are expected to rally behind Trump and deny his accusers the 17 GOP votes likely needed to convict, the rift within the party over the former president’s conduct — and his backers’ feverish fealty — was on full display on Sunday’s news talk shows.

Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who joined nine other Republicans in voting to impeach Trump, said the ex-president’s actions surrounding the siege of the Capitol merited not only impeachment, but criminal investigation. In the single article of impeachment, Trump is accused of inciting the deadly attack, in which hundreds of his followers breached the stately edifice, ransacked offices and sent lawmakers scurrying for safety.

Cheney, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” pointed in particular to Trump’s Twitter denunciation of then-Vice President Mike Pence even as rioters were in the building, with some in the mob attempting to hunt him down to prevent him from fulfilling his ceremonial duties in certifying Biden’s win. Trump falsely claimed that Pence could overturn his defeat.

“People will want to know exactly what the president was doing,” Cheney said. “They want to know, for example, whether the tweet he sent out calling Vice President Pence a coward while the attack was underway — whether that tweet, for example, was a premeditated effort to provoke violence.”

Cheney intensified her criticism of Trump on Sunday even though her impeachment vote drew attacks from Trump allies who sought unsuccessfully to eject her from her leadership post.

The party, Cheney said in her Fox interview, risked losing its way if it continues to embrace Trump.

“Somebody who has provoked an attack on the United States Capitol to prevent the counting of electoral votes, which resulted in five people dying, who refused to stand up immediately when he was asked to stop the violence — that is a person who does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward,” said Cheney, whose state party censured her Saturday over her impeachment vote.

Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who was one of only five Republicans to reject a GOP attempt to derail the trial on constitutional grounds, reiterated his view that Trump, now a private citizen, should still answer for acts committed while in office.

“It’s clearly constitutional,” Toomey, appearing on NBC, said of the trial.

Senate Republicans are expected to acquit Trump on the premise that there is no constitutional provision for trying an ex-president. Democrats and many constitutional scholars disagree, saying the Senate trial is not only constitutionally permissible, but a vital preventive measure against such acts by a future leader.

“I don’t think our job ends just because a president has left office,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on “Fox News Sunday.” He pointed out that impeachment can carry the penalty of disqualification from future officeholding as well as removal, “so there is still a consequence to President Trump if convicted.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who spearheaded the prosecution in Trump’s first impeachment trial last year, said he was not surprised that the ex-president’s supporters would put forth “that process argument” of calling the House impeachment vote unduly rushed.

“There was a real sense of urgency,” Schiff said on NBC, speaking of the riot’s aftermath. Of Trump, he said, “we felt in the House… that every day he remained in office, he was a danger to the country.”

One of Trump’s most vocal defenders, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), repeated the contention that even if what the ex-president did was wrong, impeachment was not the correct remedy.

“If you believe he committed a crime, he can be prosecuted like any other citizen,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” quickly clarifying that he himself did not think Trump’s actions were criminal. Summing up the fine line the ex-president’s backers are trying to walk, Graham insisted he was not playing down the seriousness of the attack, even as he refused to declare Trump culpable.

“That doesn’t mean what happened on Jan. 6 is OK,” Graham said. “It means this impeachment, in the eyes of most Republicans, is an unconstitutional exercise.”

Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” made an impassioned appeal for Trump to be held to account for whipping up racial hatred as part of his false narrative of election victory.

“As a Black woman, to be barricaded in my office,” she said, “that terror, those moments of terror, is familiar in a deep and ancestral way for me. And I want us to do everything to ensure that a breach like this never occurs at the Capitol, but I want us to address the evil and scourge that is white supremacy in this nation.”",Trump backer decries ‘show trial’ as Democrats call on Senate to hold him accountable

Demonstrators chanted into bullhorns and sometimes shouted profanely, Amy Elaine Wakeland said. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s wife said she notified the family’s Los Angeles Police Department security detail whenever the disruptions got so bad that the couple’s 9-year-old daughter couldn’t complete her homework or get to sleep. From March through the end of the year, Wakeland made about 80 complaints in all.

“I would be lying to you,” she said in a recent interview, “to not tell you that it is hard on my daughter and the children in this neighborhood.”

Wakeland acknowledged the protesters’ right to gather outside Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, but also questioned how much good they had done. “I don’t think you build movements by yelling at people,” she said.

During Garcetti’s first seven years in office, the mayor’s mansion had been a place for public celebrations and activist forums, with Wakeland often taking the lead. Los Angeles and its first couple seemed to be on a steady ascent, with a landslide reelection in 2017, a winning plan to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, record-setting trade and tourism, and talk of a run for the White House.

But 2020 bent the curve in ways that nobody wanted. Homelessness reached a new high in Los Angeles. The city became an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. And even Getty House could not provide a refuge for Wakeland and Garcetti, who faced a string of personal and professional crises like none they had confronted before.

First, Rick Jacobs, Wakeland’s longtime friend and a key advisor to Garcetti, was accused of sexual harassment by the mayor’s bodyguard, and then by journalist Yashar Ali and two other men. Jacobs has denied some allegations and not responded to others.

Then, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles brought its fervid opposition to Garcetti’s front door, protesting his possible appointment to a Cabinet position under President Biden. Ultimately, no Cabinet post came.

In mid-December, daughter Maya Garcetti’s coronavirus diagnosis brought the pandemic siege home, one of thousands of cases that has made Los Angeles the object of national scrutiny for its leaders’ handling of the health crisis.

The headline-making events have made it impossible for even the media-shy Wakeland to insulate herself from the troubles facing her and her husband. After their most stressful year in politics, both Garcetti and the woman he has called his closest advisor and confidant must now plot a way forward in his final chapter as mayor.

“I want to be here,” Garcetti said, in announcing he would not be going to Washington. “I need to be here.”

Wakeland, 51, began her interview with The Times by apologizing for repeatedly canceling the scheduled meeting.

“It has been quite a year,” she said.

**

Wakeland and Garcetti have been together for a quarter of a century and married for nearly half that time, a union that the mayor routinely cites as his most important relationship and a key to shaping his view of the world and the city he has governed for nearly eight years.

Wakeland gets credit from many people for helping her husband win the mayor’s office in 2013, for informing his progressive agenda during his first years in office and for steering Los Angeles city government toward greater gender equity — increasing the hiring of women on city commissions and in the municipal workforce.

Although the mayor is widely seen as a conciliator by nature, Wakeland serves as a sharper-edged alter ego, observers said.

For all her commitment in her public life to the less fortunate, Garcetti’s wife has also dismayed or infuriated some of those she has encountered in private. Along the way, she has alienated some city leaders and nurtured grudges against outsiders deemed insufficiently loyal to the Garcetti administration, multiple civic activists and former city employees said.

Wakeland said she had built her life around trying to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds. She disputed accounts that depicted her as vindictive and demanding, saying, “My life is built on kindness and compassion and generosity.”

Garcetti called Wakeland “my rock” and “a rock star.” In a recent video interview, he described the countless hours she had worked, without pay, to make Los Angeles a better place.

He rejected the idea that his wife served as an enforcer, calling that notion “dehumanizing.” He blamed contrary views on “sexist cliches and gossip” and disputed long-standing assertions that he shied away from tough decisions.

“I make tough decisions every fricking day here,” Garcetti said. “I’m proud of them, whether it’s in this pandemic or other times.”

Political consultant Eric Hacopian compared the city’s first couple to another famous political tandem — Bill and Hillary Clinton.

“They come as a team. She is as much of a political actor as he is,” Hacopian said. “Just like any highly political figures, they have long memories of who was with them and who was against them.”

A longtime friend said it’s silly and simplistic to try to hang a single label on Wakeland, or L.A.’s first couple.

“Amy comes from a really humble place and has true empathy for people who are struggling, as does Eric,” said the friend, who asked not to be named, out of fear of alienating Wakeland. “But can she be a little abrasive? Of course. Can part of their culture be that they hold on to beefs more than they should? Yes, that’s also kind of incontrovertible.”

One L.A. politician learned there could be a cost, quite literally, to getting on Wakeland’s bad side.

The conflict grew out of the 2019 school board race in which Garcetti and Wakeland backed his longtime aide, Heather Repenning, against Jackie Goldberg. A Los Angeles political mainstay, Goldberg told one campaign forum that she believed Wakeland, and therefore Repenning, had ties to charter schools, which she blamed for siphoning money from traditional public campuses.

Not long after Goldberg offered that critique, her pay — as the head of a Garcetti-backed program to hire more disadvantaged residents into city jobs — stopped for several weeks.

Goldberg was told by a member of the mayor’s staff that if she wanted to receive a $10,000 payment due to her, she should apologize to Wakeland for her campaign comments, according to a source familiar with the situation. Goldberg made the apology to Wakeland and, not long afterward, the city issued Goldberg her $10,000, said the source, who declined to be named out of fear of angering Wakeland and Garcetti.

Goldberg confirmed the source’s account but declined to provide additional details. She said she was on the same side of many social justice issues as Garcetti and Wakeland.

“I respect the work Amy does in this city. And it’s all on issues I care a lot about,” Goldberg said. “Any problems I had, I am long past them.”

Aides in the mayor’s office insisted Goldberg had never been paid late and that the gap in compensation was due to a lapse in her contract.

Asserting her “utmost respect” for Goldberg, Wakeland said, “I never heard of such a thing happening.”

In two video interviews with The Times for this story, Wakeland spoke proudly about her husband’s tenure — describing the city’s early push for social distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic, the passage of a county sales tax increase to fund transit projects, enactment of a $15-per-hour minimum wage and increased opportunities for women and girls.

Before the pandemic, women would crowd into Getty House at least three or four times a year for workshops and speeches, with Wakeland as their host for a “Women’s Leadership Series.”

The first lady worked hard to overcome her discomfort with public speaking, because she felt it would help the cause, her friends said.

“She has been this incredible force for positive change,” said Julie Gutman Dickinson, a labor attorney and friend. “She inspires younger folks and schoolchildren from Los Angeles and disadvantaged women that they can aspire to greater things in their careers and in their lives.”

At Wakeland’s insistence, women hold at least half of the positions on city commissions.

And she has pushed to increase the hiring of women in city departments. The mayor’s office boasts that 40% of programmers in the city’s Information Technology Agency are now women, compared with 21% nationally in similar jobs. The Fire Department ended the year with 114 female firefighters, or 3.4%, an increase since Garcetti took office, though short of his goal of 5% by 2020.

Youth sports programs sponsored by the city used to have twice as many spots for boys as girls. But Garcetti, who turned 50 last week, recalled how his wife “shined a light on something that could have been just accepted.” The mayor called the new gender parity in city sports “life changing” for many girls.

There was a time when “The Imperial March (Darth Vader’s Theme)” from “Star Wars” would sound from Garcetti’s phone any time his wife was calling. The mayor said he employed the special ring “tongue in cheek.” But aides said that when they heard the menacing refrain they knew that other priorities immediately would fade into the background.

When Wakeland calls, Garcetti listens.

Those seeking Garcetti’s endorsement recognized Wakeland’s singular stature. Some candidates have been told it’s wise to secure the first lady’s support to improve their chances of winning over the mayor.

“She has her own network and her own relationships that go beyond Eric,” said former Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez, explaining why candidates confer with Wakeland. “She knows a whole bunch of people in progressive and national circles.”

Another candidate didn’t appreciate Wakeland’s role, saying: “I was seeking Eric, I wasn’t seeking Amy.”

A longtime City Hall lobbyist said he made sure to give generously to causes Wakeland favored, like the union-allied Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. “You’d give to be safe,” said the lobbyist, who asked to remain anonymous. “You didn’t want to miss that embrace.”

Another crucial connection to Garcetti’s inner circle centered on Jacobs. The hard-charging advisor first came into the couple’s orbit in 2003, when he and Wakeland worked on Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in California.

Wakeland and Garcetti valued Jacobs’ aggressive fundraising and his deep loyalty, other aides said. By the time he officially joined Garcetti’s team, Jacobs talked to the first lady daily, often multiple times a day, several people familiar with the pair said. Because of his particularly strong bond with the first lady, one former aide said, Jacobs “had been viewed as above others in the mayor’s office.”

Jacobs managed to survive previous controversies, such as when a prominent business leader claimed in 2019 that she had been threatened by Jacobs when he was trying to win support for a school tax measure supported by Garcetti. (Jacobs denied making the threats.)

Wakeland said she could not discuss the sexual harassment allegations against Jacobs, given the ongoing investigation. But she denied playing a role in keeping him in Garcetti’s circle over the years, saying, “I am not involved in any personnel decisions.” Garcetti added: “The implication that, knowing there’s bad stuff, she kept [Jacobs] there, that’s just false.”

Garcetti and his future wife grew up 2,000 miles, and a world, apart.

His father, Gil, was a rising star in the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office before becoming the county’s top prosecutor in 1992. His mother, Sukey, ran a family foundation, bolstered by wealth from her family’s highly successful clothing business. The younger Garcetti had a comfortable upbringing in Encino and attended the prestigious Harvard School (now Harvard-Westlake) before Columbia University.

Wakeland began life in Indiana, a stranger to privilege. Her family moved so often it felt as if they were attached to the military. But the vagabond existence really grew out of her mother’s constant search for work. Wakeland helped pay her way through Albion College in Michigan by working as a waitress and a dispatcher for the campus police department.

When she won a Rhodes scholarship, her life took a dramatic turn. She suddenly found herself studying at Oxford, with some of America’s most promising young scholars, including future U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Garcetti.

A partnership emerged. While Garcetti became the headliner, winning a Los Angeles City Council seat, then the council presidency and, finally in 2013, the mayor’s office, Wakeland operated mostly in the background.

She worked as director of the Coalition for Kids, a school reform political action group backed by former Mayor Richard Riordan and billionaire Eli Broad. Wakeland helped promote the coalition’s candidates and their initiatives — such as relieving school crowding and improving the academic progress of underserved students.

When her husband won his Hollywood-area council seat in 2001, Wakeland became a quiet force in his office. “She didn’t control his schedule, but she restructured it frequently,” said one advisor.

For those who doubted that Wakeland would speak out on city policy, following Garcetti’s 2013 election as mayor, they got an answer when he began to craft his first budget.

It included the hiring of 50 part-time traffic officers to raise an additional $5 million in parking revenue. Economic justice groups trashed the parking plan, saying that expensive tickets fell disproportionately on the poor.

Wakeland agreed. She told the mayor’s staff the criticism was “stressing” her out and that the policy would surely turn even some Garcetti allies into enemies, according to one staffer’s record of her complaints. Wakeland insisted on reconsideration of what she deemed “such a bad idea!”

Though Wakeland’s objections did not become public at the time, the Los Angeles City Council seemed to concur, voting down the mayor’s proposal to hire more parking officers.

“Amy would fulminate and care deeply about issues,” said one former mayoral aide. “She was like the thunder you would hear offstage. She wasn’t always central. But certainly the people onstage were paying attention.”

Wakeland is known to respond furiously if she thinks her husband is being slighted.

One labor leader recalled Wakeland shouting over the phone about what she believed was the organization’s effort to set itself apart from Garcetti in the 2014 campaign to set a new citywide minimum wage in Los Angeles. “She thought we were taking the lead away from Eric,” recalled the leader, who asked to remain anonymous.

Advertisement

Union and city leaders eventually united over a proposal that increased the wage from $9 an hour to $15 per hour.

Wakeland rejected the claim that she had yelled at a labor leader over a break with her husband.

“My arguments were all about, ‘We need to go for it right now. We need to go for a universal minimum wage,’” without “carve-outs” for some groups of workers, she said.

Her friend Gutman said that any ferocity Wakeland exhibited came from a protective instinct.

“She’s a strong, compassionate mama bear,” Gutman said. “She is very protective and loving of all those around her.”

Wakeland likes to schedule her time precisely, to measure the results of her projects via data and to stick to her plans. In past interviews, she has contrasted that with her husband’s relatively more spontaneous approach.

She said her life since last March had been consumed with caring for Maya, who recovered after a mild case of COVID-19, and helping others cope with the disease. (The couple also helped raise more than half a dozen foster children.)

The citizens she assists are ones she has met over the years in her work for groups aiding the poor and victims of sexual and spousal abuse. (She has been a donor and active volunteer for the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking.) She helps arrange coronavirus tests, legal advice, counseling and quarantine housing.

“I will not say ‘No’ to someone who asks me for help,” Wakeland said. She said this commitment could at times be “exhausting.”

Some of the couple’s aspirations reach years into the future, including the 2028 Olympics, an event both see as a pivotal moment for Los Angeles. Wakeland serves on the organizing committee for the 2028 Summer Games, and predicted it would play a “big part” in Los Angeles’ economic recovery. Garcetti is pushing to have several new transit lines open in time for the lighting of the Olympic torch.

And with an optimism others might find foolhardy, Garcetti has set another monumental goal for the Olympic year: ending street homelessness in L.A.

“Our life is about working hard,” Wakeland said. “Our life is about public service.”

There’s at least one other way that the Garcetti family is reminded of the responsibilities. It’s a homemade list, written on construction paper and posted near the front door, detailing values like kindness, compassion, generosity and hard work.

During the years when the couple raised foster children in their home, a couple of the teenagers scribbled one addition to the list: “How about more freedom?”

And Wakeland recalled her husband making another amendment. It said: “How about fun?”","L.A.’s first lady, Amy Wakeland, navigates shifting political fortunes in final Garcetti years"

At least eighteen people were killed and 165 were missing in a disaster experts said appeared to point to global warming.

Video from India’s northern state of Uttarakhand showed the muddy, concrete-gray floodwaters tumbling through a valley and surging into a dam, breaking it into pieces with little resistance before roaring on downstream. The flood turned the countryside into what looked like an ash-colored moonscape.

More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police took part in the search-and-rescue operation, including soldiers expert in mountaineering, working into the night under bright halogen lights, authorities said.

The flood was caused when a portion of Nanda Devi glacier snapped off in the morning, releasing water trapped behind it, authorities said. It rushed down the mountain and into other bodies of water, forcing the evacuation of many villages along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers.

A hydroelectric plant on the Alaknanda was destroyed, and a plant under construction on the Dhauliganga was damaged, said Vivek Pandey, a spokesman for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police. Flowing out of the Himalayan mountains, the two rivers meet before merging with the Ganges River.

Pandey said at least 42 workers were trapped in tunnels at the Dhauliganga project. Twelve were rescued from one of the tunnels, while at least 30 others remained stranded inside the other, he said.

“The rescuers used ropes and shovels to reach the mouth of the tunnel. They dug through the debris and entered the tunnel. They are yet to come in touch with the stranded people,” said Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Uttarakhand’s top elected official.

An additional 140 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said. Surjeet Singh, a police official, said at least nine bodies were recovered.

The Himalayan area has a chain of hydropower projects on several rivers and their tributaries. Rawat said authorities were able to save other power units downstream because of timely action taken to release water by opening gates.

The floodwaters also damaged houses, said Ravi Bejaria, a government spokesman, though he had no details on the number and whether any of the residents were injured, missing or dead.

“It all started sometime around 10 in the morning. We heard a bang, which shook our village,” Dinesh Negi, a resident of Raini village, told the Associated Press by phone. He said they watched from high above one of the rivers as the water turned muddy and surged in a torrent.

“We knew something wrong had happened,” Negi said. “We could see the fury of the river.”

Video showed rescuers in camouflage uniforms and bright yellow or red helmets using ropes to reach victims. A man who was pulled from a muddy hole threw his arms in the air, and rescuers laughed and exulted with him. Rescue workers comforted victims lying in a row of stretchers in the open.

Scientists have long known that global warning is contributing to the melting and breakup of the world’s glaciers.

Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to U.N.-sponsored research on global warming, said that although data on the cause of the disaster were not yet available, “this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming.”

Uttarakhand Police Chief Ashok Kumar said officials immediately alerted residents in the area and evacuated them to safer places. Downstream, popular tourist spots on the banks of the Ganges were shut, and all boating activities were stopped.

Four other people were also buried in the Saturday slide but managed to dig themselves out and didn’t suffer serious injuries, according to Unified Police of Salt Lake County.

The skiers were from two separate groups, and all eight had prepared with the necessary avalanche safety gear, authorities said.

The four killed were all from the Salt Lake City area, not far from the spot where they were swept up by the skier-triggered avalanche in Millcreek Canyon.

Three of the deceased were identified as Salt Lake City residents: Louis Holian and Stephanie Hopkins, both 26, and Thomas Louis Steinbrecher, 23. The fourth, 29-year-old Sarah Moughamian, was from the suburb of Sandy, Utah.

They were experienced skiers who were well known in the community, Drew Hardesty with the Utah Avalanche Center told the Salt Lake Tribune. The avalanche danger around Salt Lake was high Saturday, the center said as it tweeted out a warning hours before the avalanche.

A faint distress call from an avalanche beacon alerted police to the slide shortly before noon Saturday. The survivors found their four companions and dug them out, but they were already dead, police said.

The still-unstable snow conditions kept rescuers from immediately recovering the bodies; recovery operations resumed Sunday morning.

Avalanches have also claimed other lives in recent days: The bodies of three hikers were found near Anchorage on Thursday. In Colorado, four backcountry skiers have died in two separate slides in the last week.

Avalanche forecasters and search-and-rescue groups have been worried for weeks that more people would be venturing into the backcountry to avoid crowds and reservation systems at ski resorts during the pandemic.","4 skiers killed, 4 injured by Utah avalanche, police say"

Meanwhile, restaurant workers and others have taken to the streets protesting shutdowns as Mexico’s coronavirus-ravaged economy continues to crater absent any significant stimulus package from the government.

“It feels like a horror film that never ends,” said Evelyn Beltrán, 39, a nurse in the city of Puebla. “What an awful sense of hopelessness and desperation.”

That’s the bleak pandemic panorama facing Mexico almost one year after the first infected person was diagnosed here. At the time, officials vowed that the country was prepared for the worst, despite its tattered healthcare infrastructure and high proportion of vulnerable citizens with diabetes, obesity, hypertension and other ailments.

Following traditional holiday family gatherings, January was the most lethal month to date, with almost 33,000 reported COVID-19 deaths, or more than 1,000 a day, according to official figures — which, authorities concede, represent a substantial undercount because of a severe lack of virus testing.

Mexico, with 165,786 official COVID-19-related deaths as of Sunday, has moved into third place on the global fatality rankings after the United States and Brazil, according to Johns Hopkins University data, surpassing India, a country with more than 10 times Mexico’s population.

Life in Mexico City, national epicenter of the virus, sputters along at a kind of frantic half-pace, subways and buses packed with mask-wearing patrons, highways jammed at rush hour, but offices largely vacant, schools mostly empty and shops and cafes generally operating on reduced hours. Street vendors, vanguard of the country’s massive informal economy, struggle to make a living. A sense of gloom and weariness — mingled with a pervasive fear of getting sick — prevails, alongside profound disquiet about what the future holds.

“My savings are used up, and there is no one who can lend us a hand,” said Gilberto Sánchez, 44, a father of two and restaurant chef in the San Angel district of southern Mexico City who has seen his weekly paycheck slashed by more than half.

He is among the lucky ones: He still has a job.

Almost 700,000 full-time jobs have been lost since last year, according to the country’s social security institute.

Official billboards in the hard-hit Iztapalapa district urging residents to “embrace the challenge” of fighting the virus seem like cruel parodies in the devastated, densely populated community. Entire families wait in line for hours in the central plaza for free coronavirus tests, only to be told that results won’t be available for two weeks or more.

Mexico’s distribution of the first batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine just before Christmas appeared to lift beleaguered national spirits. Authorities had secured from international manufacturers sufficient doses for everyone, declared President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. No one would have to pay.

The vaccine rollout seemed a policy and public relations coup for the president, who has maintained high popularity ratings despite fierce criticism of his handling of the emergency from health professionals, economists and others. He is seldom seen with a mask, has resisted imposing national lockdowns, and was slow to endorse social distancing and stay-at-home mandates.

But the initial euphoria about the vaccine’s arrival soon faded. Mexico had anticipated receiving some 400,000 doses a week through March, but Pfizer cut back, citing rising global demands. The country’s vaccine effort now appears on tenuous ground.

As of Saturday the country had administered about 711,000 doses — in a country of 126 million — and supplies are running low. Priority goes to the country’s more than 700,000 health workers, who have been ravaged, suffering almost 200,000 infections and at least 2,850 deaths — in part, many doctors and nurses say, because of the government’s failure to provide adequate protective gear. Health professionals who were first in line for Pfizer doses now fear there will be none left for the required second jabs. The country’s policy was to front-load vaccine distribution, not anticipating a shortfall.

“You finally see a small light at the end of the tunnel, believing that we would all get the vaccine, then it turns out it may not be available,” said Beltrán, the nurse, who received an initial Pfizer shot on Jan. 21. “How is it possible that this could happen?”

Now, Mexico is looking to Russia, China and other sources. Last week, Mexico said it had contracted with Moscow for 400,000 shots of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, to arrive later this month.

By most accounts, a much-hyped computer reservation system for vaccinations has been a debacle. High demand and sundry glitches have triggered multiple crashes. At any rate, the whole process is somewhat notional: Even if they secure appointments, people have no guarantee that vaccines will be available on their prescribed days.

“This government failed in the control of the pandemic, failed in medical care, and now I’m sure it is going to fail in its vaccination plan,” said Carlos Valencia, 36, an engineer in Mexico City who said he spent several days trying to arrange a vaccine date for his elderly parents without success. “As always, it is we citizens ourselves who will have to scrape with our fingernails to resolve our health and economic problems.”

Almost daily, harrowing stories appear in the news and on social media documenting the struggles of Mexicans trying to find hospital beds or oxygen for stricken loved ones. Health authorities are investigating the case of a 48-year-old man who died outside a public hospital last week, his family said, after he was barred admittance. A widely circulated video purported to show the man succumbing at the glass doors at the emergency room entrance as his distraught family pleaded for help. Relatives said they had tried, without success, to admit him into five different hospitals.

For Francisco Salazar, 73, the symptoms began last month as a headache and labored breathing, recalled his daughter, Lorena Salazar, 42. His family took him to a pharmacy with a doctor on site. His oxygen levels were dangerously low, the doctor warned. Salazar needed to be hospitalized immediately.

“That’s when our Via Crucis began,” said the daughter, referring metaphorically to the Stations of the Cross, Christ’s journey on the day of his crucifixion.

The family took Salazar to three different hospitals, she said, but none had space. They decided to bring him back home and give him oxygen. But none was available at supply outlets, now swamped with demand from COVID-19 victims. A pernicious black market has filled the void. Someone offered a tank for the equivalent of more than $3,000 — over 10 times the pre-pandemic price. The family couldn’t raise the cash.

“My father was getting worse — his lips were turning blue,” the daughter recalled.

The family finally found a slot at a public hospital. But they had to wait in line with other desperate people and fill out paperwork.

“The next day,” the daughter said, “the hospital informed us that our father had died.”

The death certificate lists COVID-19 as the “probable” cause of his demise, on Jan. 23.

“I feel anger, rage, sadness, guilt — I feel terrible for not having been able to do more for my father,” said Lorena Salazar, sobbing. “I wonder if it would have been different if we hadn’t lost so much time looking for a hospital, or trying to find oxygen. But we will never know. I just hope my father understands and forgives us.”

President López Obrador, himself infected, announced last week that his latest test results had come back negative and that his symptoms were mild. He was expected to be back in the public eye in coming days after two weeks of isolation.

South Africa received its first 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week and was expected to begin giving shots to healthcare workers in mid-February. The disappointing early results indicate that an inoculation drive using the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful.

Preliminary data from a small study suggested that the AstraZeneca vaccine offered only “minimal protection against mild-moderate disease” caused by the variant in South Africa. The variant appears more infectious and is driving a deadly resurgence of the disease in the country, currently accounting for more than 90% of the COVID-19 cases, health minister Zweli Mkhize said Sunday night.

“The AstraZeneca vaccine appeared effective against the original strain but not against the variant,” Mkhize said. “We have decided to put a temporary hold on the rollout of the vaccine. ... More work needs to be done.”

The study, which hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, involved 2,000 people, most of whom were young and healthy. The volunteers’ average age was 31.

“Protection against moderate-severe disease, hospitalization or death could not be assessed in this study as the target population were at such low risk,” said a statement issued by Oxford University and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

Scientists will be studying whether the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in preventing severe disease and death against the variant, Mkhize said.

Other vaccines have shown reduced efficacy against the variant but have provided good protection from serious disease and death.

Public health officials are concerned about the South African variant because it contains a mutation of the virus’ characteristic spike protein, which is targeted by existing vaccines. South African officials say the variant is more contagious, and evidence is emerging that it may be more virulent.

South Africa will urgently roll out other vaccines to inoculate as many as possible in the coming months, Mkhize said. Other South African scientists on Sunday said the clinical trials for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine showed good results against the variant.

The early results for the AstraZeneca vaccine against the variant could have far-reaching implications, as many other countries in Africa and beyond have been planning to use the AstraZeneca shot. The international COVAX initiative has bought the AstraZeneca vaccine in bulk from the Serum Institute of India.

Developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine expect to have a modified vaccine to cope with the South Africa coronavirus variant by autumn, the vaccine’s lead researcher said Sunday.

Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher for the Oxford team, told the BBC on Sunday that “we have a version with the South African spike sequence in the works.”

“It looks very likely that we can have a new version ready to use in the autumn,” she added.

Authorities in England last week went house-to-house to administer coronavirus testing in eight areas where the South African variant is believed to be spreading, after a handful of cases were found among people who had no contact with the country or anyone who traveled there.

More than 100 cases of the South African variant have been found in the U.K. The testing blitz is a bid to snuff out the variant before it spreads widely and undermines the U.K.’s vaccination rollout.

Britain has seen Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 112,000 confirmed deaths, but it has embarked on a speedier vaccination plan than the neighboring European Union. So far, the U.K. has given a first coronavirus vaccine shot to about 11.5 million people.",South Africa suspends AstraZeneca vaccine drive after study shows minimal protection

“If [the U.S.] wants Iran to return to its commitments, it must lift all sanctions in practice, then we will do verification … then we will return to our commitments,” state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying in his first comments on the matter since Biden took office.

Biden rejected the idea in a “CBS Evening News” interview taped Friday and airing Sunday.

He was asked if the U.S. would lift sanctions first to get Iran back to the bargaining table.

“No,” Biden replied. He was then asked if Iran had to stop enriching uranium first. Biden nodded.

Former President Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from the atomic deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Biden has said he will seek to revive the deal, but insisted that Iran first reverse its nuclear steps, creating a contest of wills between the nations.

“This is the definitive and irreversible policy of the Islamic Republic, and all of the country’s officials are unanimous on this, and no one will deviate from it,” Khamenei added Sunday, reiterating Iranian leaders’ previous remarks that the U.S. must ease its sanctions before Iran comes back into compliance.

The supreme leader, 81, has the final say on all matters of state in Iran and approved the efforts at reaching the nuclear deal in 2015.

In response to Trump’s so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, the country began to gradually violate its atomic commitments, and threatened further provocations in a bid to increase its leverage and get Biden to prioritize a return to the deal as he moved to dismantle Trump’s legacy. Biden has signed a series of executive actions that reverse course on a wide range of issues, including climate change and immigration.

Following the killing in November of an Iranian scientist credited with spearheading the country’s disbanded military nuclear program, Iran’s parliament approved a law to block international nuclear inspectors later this month — a serious violation of the accord.

Iran also has begun enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels and has said it will experiment with uranium metals, a key component of a nuclear warhead. The country has announced its moves and insisted that all breaches of the pact are easily reversible. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.","Iran tells U.S. to lift all sanctions, then it’ll comply with nuclear deal. Biden says: No"
['Associated Press'],https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2021-02-06/leon-spinks-heavyweight-boxing-champion-dies-at-67,[],"Former boxing champion Leon Spinks, who defeated Muhammad Ali to claim the heavyweight title, has died after battling prostate and other cancers. He was 67.",[''],en,2021-02-06 00:00:00,https://www.latimes.com,,{'Boxing & MMA'},"Leon Spinks, who won Olympic gold and then shocked the boxing world by beating Muhammad Ali to win the heavyweight title in only his eighth pro fight, has died. He was 67.

Spinks, who lived his later years in Las Vegas, died Friday night, according to a release from a public relations firm. He had been battling prostate and other cancers.

His wife, Brenda Glur Spinks, and a few close friends and other family members were by his side when he passed away.

A lovable heavyweight with a drinking problem, Spinks beat Ali by decision in a 12-round fight in 1978 to win the title. He was unranked at the time and picked as an opponent because Ali was looking for an easy fight.

He got anything but that, with an unorthodox Spinks swarming over Ali throughout the fight on his way to a stunning win by split decision. The two met seven months later at the Superdome in New Orleans, with Ali taking the decision this time before a record indoor boxing crowd of 72,000 and a national television audience estimated at 90 million people.

“It was one of the most unbelievable things when Ali agreed to fight him because you look at the fights he had up to then and he was not only not a top contender but shouldn’t have been a contender at all,” promoter Bob Arum said Saturday. ”He was just an opponent, but somehow he found a way to win that fight.“

Spinks would lose the rematch to Ali in New Orleans and fought for the title only once after that, when he was stopped in the third round in 1981 by Larry Holmes. He continued fighting on and off into the mid-1990s, finishing with a record of 26-17-3.

Spinks, with a big grin that often showed off his missing front teeth, was popular among boxing fans for both his win over Ali and his easygoing personality. But he burned through his earnings quickly, and at one point after retiring was working as a custodian at a YMCA in Nebraska, cleaning locker rooms.

He later was part of a group of ex-fighters who had their brains studied by the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. Spinks was found to have brain damage caused by a combination of taking punches to the head and heavy drinking, though he functioned well enough to do autograph sessions and other events late in his life.

“He was a good soul,” said Gene Kilroy, who was Ali’s business manager when he fought Spinks and became friends with the fighter.

Spinks won the light heavyweight division at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, beating Sixto Soria of Cuba in an upset to become one of five U.S. fighters to win gold. His brother, Michael, who would later become heavyweight champion himself, won the middleweight gold, and Sugar Ray Leonard took the welterweight title.

Spinks was hardly spectacular after turning pro, winning six of his first seven fights. Just four months before he met Ali, he could manage just a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux and he wasn’t on anyone’s radar in the heavyweight title picture.

But Ali was coming off a brutal fight with Earnie Shavers and wasn’t looking forward to what would have been a mandatory bout against Ken Norton, whom he had already fought three times and who seemed to have Ali’s number. Instead, he sought an easy mark for a fight that was to be nationally televised on ABC, even knowing he would be stripped of one of his titles for taking another fight.

Enter Spinks, who was such a big underdog most sports books didn’t even take bets on the fight.

“In that fight everything clicked,” Arum said. “He came in with a game plan, and he beat Ali. It wasn’t that Ali wasn’t at his best, but Leon shocked everybody with how good Leon was.”

Arum was in the dressing room with Ali after the fight, and said Ali directed him to sign Spinks to a quick rematch. The two fought seven months later in a prime-time fight on CBS that set television viewing records at the time, with nearly half the country tuning in.

Ali took the rematch more seriously than he did the first fight, winning a decision, though Spinks was competitive. Spinks might have been better, Arum said, but enjoyed the life of being heavyweight champion too much and partied much of the time between fights.

“Leon posed in a bathtub with a glass of champagne smoking a cigar. He suddenly had an entourage as big as one that Ali had,” Arum said. “We were all staying at the same hotel in New Orleans for the rematch, and one morning I was coming down to breakfast and Leon got in the elevator and collapsed on the floor. Obviously he had been out drinking, and I said, ‘Leon, are you crazy? You’re fighting in just a few days.’ He said ‘What do you mean? I’m just coming in from roadwork.’”

Among the notable people in Spinks’ entourage was Lawrence Tureaud, who would later be known as the actor Mr. T and served as bodyguard for the champion.

Spinks was born July 11, 1953, in St. Louis, raised in poverty along with his brother Michael. After discovering boxing, both brothers became top amateurs, culminating in the 1976 Olympics, in which Leon won the light heavyweight gold and Michael won the middleweight gold.

Michael Spinks would go on to win the heavyweight title himself in 1985, defending it three times before being knocked out by Mike Tyson in 91 seconds in their 1988 fight in Atlantic City. By then, the best part of Leon’s career was over, though he would fight until losing a December 1995 fight against Fred Houpe in St. Louis.

After moving to Las Vegas, Spinks was married to Brenda Glur Spinks in 2011. The two were often seen at boxing-related activities, including Spinks’ 2017 induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.

“He was happy go lucky, the salt of the earth,” Arum said, chuckling at the memories. “Leon was nutty, but you couldn’t get angry at the guy. He never meant any harm to anyone. You couldn’t help but love him even though you shook your head at how he acted.”","Leon Spinks, who beat Muhammad Ali for heavyweight boxing title, dies at 67"

She had been arrested many years earlier for prostitution, when she was barely out of her teens. Her name and the charges against her had been published in The Times and now, in the internet era, the article was one of the first things that popped up when you googled her name.

She began to cry on the phone. She’d done something wrong a long, long time ago, she said, and now she couldn’t escape it. Potential employers had seen the story. She was worried her daughter would stumble across it.

Couldn’t we just take the article down? Make it impossible to find on search? Take her name out of it?

Advertisement

The answer was no.

I felt terrible. The crime she was accused of didn’t seem to me like something that should haunt a person forever.

In the old days, a story like that would appear in the print editions, but a few days later all those papers would be lining birdcages or wrapping fish, and the article would only be findable in archives, often on microfilm or microfiche.

But now, nothing goes away. Everything can be found online, instantly.

That technological reality — and an increasing push from criminal justice reformers who believe that long ago, low-level crimes ought to be forgotten — is leading some news organizations around the country to rethink their policies.

In late January, the Boston Globe became the latest to roll out a change. The paper announced a new “Fresh Start” initiative, under which it will allow people to apply to have stories about their “past embarrassments, mistakes or minor crimes” updated, anonymized or in some cases delisted from Google search results. The newspaper explained that the value of giving someone a new chance in life “often outweighs the historic value of keeping a story widely accessible long after an incident occurred.”

I think that’s the wrong solution.

It’s not that I don’t sympathize with the subjects of these stories. It is long past time for society to change the way it views people who have had run-ins with the criminal justice system. A person convicted of selling a small amount of drugs, for instance, should not be considered beyond redemption or denied jobs or apartments for the rest of his or her life. This has been a problem especially for people of color.

Newspapers absolutely should play a part in ameliorating the situation by reconsidering, going forward, what they report in the paper, how they play and contextualize crime stories, what language they use and how they evaluate facts they get from police.

But they shouldn’t muck around with history. Trying to rewrite the past, or even trying to hide from view what has already been reported, is almost always a mistake.

It may sound self-important, but what appears in the newspaper really is the first draft of history. Of course it is sometimes flawed, sometimes incomplete, sometimes even unfair, but it’s the best record we have. We’re opening a dangerous door if we agree to go back and alter an old article because we no longer think it’s newsworthy or we wish we hadn’t said what we said or we have a different sense now of what’s right or wrong.

Unpublishing is a violation of our obligation to readers, and to transparency. And it doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is society’s unforgiving attitude. It merely makes information in the public record less accessible.

Advertisement

And where does such revisionism end? Once you’re changing old stories, surely there will be a temptation to go beyond crime stories, to protect people from other negative coverage they find embarrassing.

There’ll even be internal pressure: Why shouldn’t the L.A. Times delete from its archives, say, the racist editorials it wrote in support of incarcerating Japanese Americans during World War II?

But the answer is simple: Those editorials are part of the historical record, and we can’t scrub ourselves clean of them now.

Remember Winston Smith in George Orwell’s “1984”? His job at the “Ministry of Truth” was to bring old newspaper accounts into line with whatever Big Brother said was the truth today. That meant rewriting old articles that “it was thought necessary to alter, or as the official phrase had it, to rectify.”

Advertisement

There is no current discussion at the L.A. Times of adopting a policy that would allow the paper to change or hide already-published stories. But other papers are moving forward.

There have been lawsuits in several states seeking to force newspapers to take down old stories in cases where a conviction was expunged. But courts have generally ruled that newspapers are under no obligation to do so.

I’m not saying there could never be a case where, on balance, it might be justified — a life or death situation, for instance, or a legal order to do so. But in the vast majority of cases there are other steps newspapers can take to help people who feel an old story is unfairly affecting them.

Newspapers can, for instance, correct inaccuracies, even in an old story. And they can go further (although they have no legal obligation to do so) and update stories with additional relevant information. For instance, if an article cites an arrest but then charges were later dropped or the suspect was acquitted or subsequently exonerated, editors could append a note to the original article explaining the outcome. In other cases, a note could be added offering greater context, if merited.

Would that have helped the woman who called me? Perhaps, but perhaps not. And it is certainly unsettling to reflect that stories might be causing unfair harm or pain to people we write about.

But erasing history by “rectifying” past stories sets a dangerous precedent.

The national board of Hollywood’s biggest union voted to deny the former president potential to rejoin the union, it said in a statement Sunday. Five board members, including broadcast journalists, abstained from the vote Sunday, which took place via via video conference. The decision was made after Trump resigned from the union before hearings over disciplinary charges against the “Apprentice” star could be heard.

Trump on Thursday departed the union in an insult-filled missive that lauded his own work in the entertainment industry. In the wake of the Capitol insurrection, a SAG-AFTRA disciplinary committee had been due on Friday to weigh Trump’s expulsion from the union for inciting attacks against reporters.

“Preventing Donald Trump from ever rejoining SAG-AFTRA is more than a symbolic step,” union president Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement. “It is a resounding statement that threatening or inciting harm against fellow members will not be tolerated.”

Despite his exclusion from the union, federal laws protect Trump’s access to a pension from the union and do not stop him from working on SAG-AFTRA productions.

In his letter, Trump criticized the union, which represents some 160,000 performers, actors and broadcast journalists, for policy violations and what he described as “egregious” disciplinary failures, without detailing them. “Who cares!” he wrote.

Affairs', 'COVID-19 Pandemic'}","I was scrolling through Facebook not too long ago, catching up on the various and sundry things friends were doing. One posted photos of views from a solo hike into the hills; another posted video of a stellar musical performance filmed in her cozy living room. A third offered pictures of a Covid-inspired art piece. It was of a solitary figure, standing in a haze of what looked like an orange-hued fog with barely discernible faces hovering in the air, out of focus and out of reach.

I marveled as I caught up with my peeps’ latest artistic endeavors, pleased that so many had found creative outlets for the surreal way of life thrust upon us since so much of the world shut down on March 19. A day that happens to be my birthday. (And to think that when I blew out the candles on my cake those months back, I silently wished for a gift of less stress in my life.)

Living in Los Angeles, I was used to a relatively topsy-turvy life. Nightmare traffic, absurdly high housing costs, restaurants that ranged from God-awful to divine and weather that has you bundled up in faux fur in the morning and poolside come the afternoon. I was also used to a life peopled by artists from seemingly every discipline. Los Angeles is a textbook company town, and nearly everyone I knew worked in the entertainment industry in some form or another. Some were writers and actors, like me. Others were editors, costumers, makeup artists, producers, directors.

Almost everyone lived in L.A. because they aspired to more of a career than Hometown, U.S.A., could offer. We put up with an insane life, one of atmospheric highs and subterranean lows, to pursue our dreams. And almost all of us worked a rainbow of maintenance and service day jobs — waiting tables, detailing cars, tending bars, catering parties — all to maintain a life in an unforgivingly expensive city in order to be present when “the call” came in.

Though my friends and I danced around these same interconnected career loops, I rarely, if ever, saw them outside of work, either our day jobs or the industry jobs we landed when we were lucky. We all lived in various parts of the L.A. sprawl, and most of us spent our personal time on the career-path treadmill, with classes, workshops and the daily search for artistic employment. There wasn’t much time left for socializing.

But it didn’t matter; we saw each other at work. The very nature of these jobs allowed for abundant socializing. Work allowed us to keep in touch and up to date with everybody’s highs, lows and in-betweens. We celebrated birthdays in the kitchen and gave back pats of congrats at the coffee station on landing a gig or hugs of support while passing each other in the hallway when that gig fell through. We were there for each other.

We shared a true communal love affair.

Advertisement

I know this may sound bizarre to anyone not pursuing a career in the arts, but a love affair is what it was.

For those who choose a career in entertainment or the arts, there is no 9-to-5 job, consistent and secure, to greet you every day. There is no pre-set career path laid out before you with obvious and logical steps up from entry-level to top of the heap. There are no paid holidays, no bonuses, nothing remotely resembling any type of security. For me and countless others in my circle, the only comfort and security is being wrapped in a blanket of others in the same position, a collective of fellow dreamers providing desperately needed emotional support, any time, day or night. Providing love.

But like most love affairs, I couldn’t really see or appreciate it until it was over.

Since my birthday, since I made that damn wish over that cake, I haven’t seen a single one of these friends. Film and television production stopped, parties were canceled, restaurants closed and bars were shuttered. Every avenue of income, from high-paying industry gigs to minimum-wage-plus-tips serving jobs, disappeared overnight. Since that date, my only contact with many of these friends has been through a post on Instagram or Facebook, assuming we had already connected there.

A chill slithered down my spine when I first realized I didn’t even know the full name of many of my cohorts. We were all on a first-name basis seconds after being introduced. When your first how-do-you-do is followed moments later by being thrown into the trenches of work, there’s no time or reason for last names and family history.

And yet, between passing hors d’oeuvres and pouring coffee, we shared our deepest of dreams and darkest of fears. With the sharing of dreams and nightmares now exclusively online, how could I possibly find and connect with someone when the only search criteria I had was a first name? Do you know how many “Daves” there are on Facebook? Even if I lucked into finding a few, I couldn’t possibly fill the physical void that grew more vast with every passing day.

Besides, posts and “likes” are woefully inadequate substitutes for hugs.

One day as I scrolled through post after post, I noticed that many of these work friends are not just socially distanced from me. They are now physically distant as well. With no way to pay L.A. rents, my cohorts had fled town, spreading out to the corners of the Earth in search of a place to live without fear of eviction.

A pang bounded through my heart. I realized I’d likely never see many of them ever again. Certainly not in the way I had before. Some were a county or so away; others were at the other end of the country. A couple of them had fled the States altogether. All had depended upon the gargantuan hospitality job segment of the Los Angeles economy, a segment almost completely shut down since March. When a few restaurants were allowed to partially re-open with outdoor dining, only one in 100 jobs at best survived. For cater-waiters, like me, there was absolutely nothing.

Even in a best-case scenario, a super-duper vaccine with lightning-fast distribution, it will take months, probably years, for everything to return to some semblance of normal. How many of my now-departed friends will be able to return? How many dreams will, or even can, survive the wait for the world to get back on its feet?

As I looked at my computer screen, I felt as though I were looking at a school yearbook from eons ago — photos and captions of people I had loved who were now just memories waiting to fade. We don’t didn’t even have the structure of class reunions to offer the chance to re-connect.

I know the only way to heal my hurt is to recognize that it stems from the loss of love, for that is what it is. I loved these wonderful, crazy, irritating, inspiring people, and my life is a shell without them. But there is an exit from this maze. What I can do is grieve this loss as I would the loss of any love. I can heal this hurt by acknowledging the pain my work friends’ absence has caused. I can then move on from the pain by celebrating the joy they brought me. The laughs we shared as we bused tables, the thrill we all felt when somebody got a gig, the Fourth of Julys, Thanksgivings and Christmases spent together working.

There is a hole in my life the size of the universe, but I trust it won’t always be so. I know that the love I freely gave and eagerly accepted is waiting to be given and taken again. My world will once again be re-populated with fellow journeymen, artists seeking to carve out a life in Los Angeles. When they appear, I will embrace them. I will gleefully fall back into the supportive and uplifting arms of fellow artists. But from now on, I will do more than enjoy the moments spent in the physical company of my friends. I will treasure every one of them.

The pass was Brady’s first first-quarter touchdown in ten Super Bowl appearances.

“Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski have now connected for 13 postseason touchdowns, the most by any two players in NFL history,” ESPN’s Field Yates tweeted. “Elite chemistry.”

“SUPER BOWL GRONK SPIKES ARE BACK,” NFL on ESPN tweeted.

“Now THAT was a vintage Tom Brady TD drive,” Fox Sports’ Skip Bayless tweeted. “Nobody’s ever done it better. Living legend, better than ever at 43, shattering the mold.”

The two connected for a second touchdown — this one from 17 yards out — to put Tampa Bay up 14-3 in second quarter. He joined Jerry Rice as the only two players in NFL history with multiple receiving touchdowns in multiple Super Bowls, according to NFL Research.

“Gronkowski (5) & Rice (8) are the only players with 5+ career receiving TD in the Super Bowl,” the NFL Research Twitter account added.

Brady, 43, has the most Super Bowl starts of any player in NFL history, leading John Elway (5) and Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, Terry Bradshaw, Jim Kelly and Roger Staubach (4). He entered the game with the most all-time pass completions (256), passing yards (2,838), passing touchdowns (18) and wins (6) in a Super Bowl.

The longtime Patriot joined the Buccaneers this offseason via free agency after twenty years in New England. He and Gronkowski were teammates on the Patriots from 2010 through 2018 and won three Super Bowls together during that span.

Gronkowski, 31, briefly retired in 2019, but came out of retirement to reunite with Brady in Tampa Bay.

The internet also took this moment to take jabs at the Patriots and head coach Bill Belichick.

“Does it count as a NE Super Bowl win if the only Bucs who score played most of their careers for the Patriots…….. #SuperBowl #SBLV #BigGameBound (pats fan crying over here),” ABC News’ Allie Berube tweeted.

Defense reined early, including a three-and-out by Tom Brady and the Buccaneers to begin the game, but the Chiefs took the lead on their second possession.

After Patrick Mahomes’ two shots at the end zone came up empty, Harrison Butker booted a 49-yard field goal to give the Chiefs a 3-0 lead with 5:10 left in the first quarter.

Brady and the Buccaneers then shook off their rough start to answer on the very next drive. Brady hit Antonio Brown and Cameron Brate for big gains, followed by a long run from Leonard Fournette.

Brady eventually found his old favorite, tight end Rob Gronkowski, for an 8-yard touchdown pass on a play-action screen to go up 7-3. Brady finished the quarter 6-of-7 passing for 50 yards while Mahomes was just 2-for-8 for nine yards.

The Chiefs punted early in the second quarter, unable to find an answer for Tampa Bay’s first touchdown. Brady and the Bucs then began driving again, with a huge 31-yard completion to Mike Evans bringing them to the 6-yard line. There was nearly a big man touchdown, but tackle Joe Haeg dropped Brady’s pass in the back of the end zone. The Bucs eventually faced a fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line and Bruce Arians risked it for the biscuit, but Ronald Jones was stuffed as the Chiefs made the goal-line stand.

Kansas City gave the ball back quickly on a short punt, then hurt itself with two penalties — a holding that negated a Tyrann Mathieu interception and an offsides that negated a field-goal attempt. On the very next play, Brady hit Gronkowski for a 17-yard touchdown to make it 14-3 with 6:05 to go.

Mahomes finally got the Chiefs driving, as he hooked up with Travis Kelce on multiple occasions to get down the field. But they stalled out at the 14-yard line, with Mahomes pressured into a third-down throwaway. The Chiefs settled for a 34-yard field goal from Butker to make it 14-6 with 1:01 left in the half.

That left too much time for Brady. He got help from two more penalties, a pair of pass interferences, that put the Bucs at the 1-yard line with 10 seconds left. Brady hit Brown for a quick touchdown to make it a 21-6 halftime lead.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire exploded for the Chiefs’ biggest play of the game at the time on the first play of the second half, a 26-yard run. It still didn’t spark a touchdown drive, but Butker got the Chiefs within 21-9 on a 52-yard field goal. Brady and Gronkowski continued their blast from the past on the next drive, with a 25-yard connection. It set up a 27-yard touchdown run from Leonard Fournette for a 28-9 advantage.

Mahomes then picked a bad time for his first interception, but it wasn’t all his fault. His pass intended for Tyreek Hill in traffic was deflected and Antoine Winfield Jr. scooped it up before the ball could hit the ground for the pick. The Buccaneers turned it into points, though they had to settle for their first field goal of the night, a 52-yarder from Ryan Succop.",Super Bowl 2021: Buccaneers dominating Chiefs

Jordan and Bruce Springsteen made his commercial debut for Jeep.

Celebrity cameos in this year’s crop of Super Bowl commercials veered on the zany and were heavy on nostalgia, as companies tried to relay upbeat, hopeful messages amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But brands also took the opportunity to say something meaningful about our unprecedented times, according to a team of top ad executives assembled by The Post.

“Advertisers are leaning heavily on how 2020 was the worst year in recent memory,” said Jennifer DaSilva, president at Berlin Cameron.

“Most of the spots are optimistic and hopeful as we embark on a new year.”

Here’s what our panel of experts made of the Super Bowl 55 ads:

Amazon – “Alexa’s Body”

“Again, please,” was likely what every woman in America said after seeing this ad, according to Nicole Michels McDonagh, of Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners.

Amazon turned its virtual assistant Alexa into a sex symbol with the help of Michael B. Jordan in this fun and memorable ad.

However, some of our experts felt the spot’s sultriness was heavy-handed, especially for a family-friendly product.

“Yes, the sexual innuendo is over-the-top at times, but high marks for sheer entertainment,” said Chris Graves, Chief Creative Officer at Team One.

“Really well-crafted as a film,” Graves added. “And appreciate the attempt to give a somewhat intrusive technology a human face — an extremely good-looking human face.”

Average grade: A

Bud Light — “Last Year’s Lemons”

Bud Light’s spot was a nod to the “lemon” of a year we’ve just had — though “this ad is anything BUT a lemon,” said DaSilva.

Most of our experts enjoyed the clip’s quirky metaphor for 2020 and its take on the age-old adage: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”

In the ad, giant lemons raining down on weddings and other parties, and though we’ve seen unexpected objects falling from the sky before, this one was “nicely produced and fun to watch,” said Graves.

“Thank you, Bud Light,” said Jennie Moore, Creative Director at WONGDOODY in Seattle.

“We could either laugh or cry about last year, and this helped me share in a much-needed laugh.”

Overall grade: A-

Uber Eats — “Wayne’s World”

Comedians Dana Carvey and Mike Myers of “Wayne’s World” brought viewers back to the 1990s for this fun ad.

“A lot of brands have made Super Bowl Sunday into ‘Throwback Thursday,'” noted Andy Nathan, founder and CEO of the Fortnight Collective.

“The Wayne’s World local access cable TV show working to help local restaurants makes a lot of sense for Uber Eats and what they promise.”

Add the cameo from Cardi B and the ad becomes even more “fun, eye catching and entertaining,” said Moa Netto, Chief Creative Officer at RAPP US.

SPIN CEO Jimmy Hutcheson added: “The one thing that always hits a mark is nostalgia.”

“In recent years, Super Bowl commercials have tapped into that by resuscitating beloved movie characters,” Hutcheson said.

“Thus, it makes perfect sense that grabbing Mike Myers and Dana Carvey for a Wayne’s World reunion would absolutely make sense and work.”

“Adding current pop icon Cardi B to that equation? Brilliant,” said Hutcheson, “a big win for Uber Eats to appeal to people from multiple generations.”

Average grade: A-

Cheetos — “It Wasn’t Me”

Cheetos enlisted celebrity couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis for this ad, set to Shaggy’s “It Wasn’t Me.”

“I liked how they were able to leverage the cultural power of an iconic song while keeping the product at the center of the narrative,” said Netto.

Eric Stein, Chief Creative Officer at Hooray Agency, agreed on the choice of tune.

“Shaggy steals the show. Mila and Ashton work ‘ok’ as support,” said Stein, who gave the ad a C.

Tim Smith, president of Chemistry in Atlanta, said: “I wanted to like this one but it seemed off.”

“Shaggy and the music was great but the acting and singing of two stars I really like, was awkward.”

Average grade: B-

Scotts Miracle-Gro — “Big Game Commercial”

The slew of celebs making an appearance in this ad felt forced, according to our experts.

It was also another hit at nostalgia with John Travolta’s special appearance.

But event that wasn’t enough to save this spot.

“The Super Bowl ads are teeming with celebs this year, and a big chunk of them seem to be in this spot,” said Graves.

“It’s strangely compelling as you try and figure out how one relates to the next. Then Travolta shows up and all bets are off. All to promote a contest to win a lawn and garden of your dreams? It’s a lot to process.”

Average grade: C

Robinhood — “We are all investors”

Robinhood was recently in the headlines in connection with the GameStop saga, but the investing app’s first Super Bowl commercial fell flat, according to our experts.

“I think Robinhood was smart to use the current PR to reinforce brand awareness on the biggest stage,” said Smith, adding: “Having said that I think they missed the mark on a Super Bowl spot.”

“The spot is beautifully shot but a too quiet for the stage.”

Husani Oakley, Chief Technology Officer at Deutsch NY, noted that “There was probably not enough time to make any changes,” in the aftermath of the stock market madness.

Still, ” I don’t think the spot would have worked well even in a pre-#GameStopGate world.”

“The basic idea — that everyone invests in something, so why not invest via Robinhood — is spot-on, but the execution falls pretty flat, and doesn’t quite live up to it’s potential.”

The Super Bowl is looking more than a bit different in 2021.

While the big game usually attracts major A-listers to the stands, attendance at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium is capped at just 22,000 fans this year (although 30,000 life-size cut-outs — including celeb fans like Eric Stonestreet — are there too).

Most celebrities have opted for their own Super Bowl viewing plans at home, though others, like 50 Cent and Tory Lanez, have touched down in Tampa to celebrate.

As the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, here is how celebrities are celebrating Super Bowl Sunday from home.

Emily Ratajkowski

Mom-to-be Emily Ratajkowski made a variety of game-day snacks for her at-home Super Bowl celebration.

The model posted several snaps of her creations, including a pic of homemade nachos she was “[very] proud” of making.

Another photo shared to her Instagram story showed a big bowl of chips, several types of dips and some Super Bowl-themed cookies.

Earlier in the day, she shared videos of the snowy scene in New York on Sunday,

Lady Gaga

Lady Gaga, who performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2017, is spending her game day at home this year.

“QUARANTINING WITH MY BESTIES,” she captioned a pic with a pal.

She looked cozy in a gray hoodie sweatshirt as she snuggled up on the couch.

Gaga also wished The Weeknd good luck for his own halftime performance this year.

“WHOSE EXCITED FOR THE HALFTIME SHOW!!! @theweeknd go get em’ 🙏 #superbowl,” she wrote.

Amy Schumer

Amy Schumer seemed to be more interested in the commercials than the Super Bowl.

The comedian, who appeared in a Hellmann’s ad during the game, shared a video of herself watching from home with her husband, Chris Fischer, and their young son, Gene.

She recorded Gene’s reaction to her commercial, writing, “First time seeing mom on tv. 🦗.”

Baby Gene did not seem amused.

Drake

Drake watched The Weeknd’s Super Bowl performance and shared it to his Instagram story on Sunday. Instagram

Drake enjoyed the Super Bowl on the small screen this year.

The rapper posted a video of himself watching The Weeknd’s Super Bowl halftime show on a big flatscreen TV in what appeared to be a cozy bedroom.

“Big moment for the city!” Drake captioned the video, referencing their mutual home city of Toronto.

Kendall Jenner

In another post, she wished fans a lovely day, showing the sunset from outside her home.

Carson Daly

Carson Daly was also enjoying a a boozy Super Bowl celebration from home.

The TV host posted a photo of a generously-garnished Bloody Mary cocktail to his Instagram on Sunday morning.

“Happy #Superbowl !” he captioned the pic.

His “Today” show co-host Dylan Dreyer noted that Daly was getting an early start to the festivities, as the game wasn’t until the evening.

“You’ve got a long day ahead of you if you’re starting now!” she commented.

But Daly assured Dreyer that he would be be just fine.

“I thought you knew me better than that!,” he wrote back, adding, “I don’t even consider it drinking yet, it’s just breakfast.”

Al Roker

Al Roker said he was missing his “Today” show pals Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie for this year’s Super Bowl, but had a tasty-looking celebration with wife Deborah Roberts and son Nick Roker at home.

Posting a video of the family’s platters of Super Bowl chow, Roker read out the menu: “Wings, pigs in a blanket, nachos, sliders, cheese plate, salad, dips.”

Nick Carter

Die-hard Bucs fan Nick Carter is celebrating at home with a big-screen TV, fan gear galore — and a whole lot of confidence.

“The Buccaneers will win the Super Bowl,” he said in a spirited Instagram video. “Mark my words. Mark this post. Don’t come at me. This is our year. Bucs win, baby. Let’s go!”

Jay Cutler

Jay Cutler got inspiration for his Super Bowl menu from his ex.

The former Chicago Bears quarterback posted a recipe for “Sunday Wings Two Ways” from Kristin Cavallari’s gluten-free cookbook.

“While we can’t decide on which @kristincavallari wings to make, we do have a pick on the Super Bowl,” he captioned the pic.

Cutler’s game day décor included a Kansas City Chiefs tablecloth.

Cutler and Cavallari announced their divorce in April 2020, but have posted supportive messages online ever since.

Ramona Singer

Ramona Singer has apparently returned to New York for the Super Bowl.

The 64-year-old posted a snowy game-day photo from the Hamptons after she was blasted for partying at Mar-a-Lago as well as St. Barts — even after “RHONY” producers had begged cast members to stay home.

“Snowy #SuperBowl Sunday in Southampton ❄️,” the “Real Housewives of New York” star wrote on Instagram.

As Page Six previously reported, Singer posted several pics from her Manhattan pad that made it look like she’d been in NYC, even though she’d been traveling.

Bethenny Frankel

Bethenny Frankel is spending the day rooting for the Buccaneers.

“Usually I give zero ‘Buccs’ about football,” Frankel said in a video posted to Instagram on Sunday.

But the former “RHONY” star had a few reasons to root for Tampa: Her assistant is from the Florida city, she’s a fan of Tom Brady’s because she used to live in Boston, and she considers Brady’s wife, Gisele Bündchen, an “HBIC” (“Head Bitch In Charge”).

“Love the player… love the game. I also love the town and the wife… #HBIC #SuperBowlSunday,” she captioned her game-day post.

Joe Giudice

Joe Giudice celebrated the Super Bowl from all the way in Italy.

The former “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star posted a video from the beach telling football fans to enjoy the game, adding that he thinks the Chiefs would win.

The report said Mahomes will see a foot specialist after the Super Bowl and the expectation is he’ll need surgery.

Mahomes was listed on the injury report this past week but practiced fully each day. Mahomes did not show any effects of the injury in the AFC Championship game when he went 29 of 38 passing for 325 yards and three touchdowns. He said the toe is feeling a “lot better” this week.

“Having these two weeks to let it rest and heal up,” Mahomes said, “especially being almost three weeks, over three weeks away from the injury itself. If you look at those type of injuries, that kind of gives you the normal timeline. Definitely every single day that I get to rest it, makes it better.”

Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy was passed over for a head-coaching job again this year and it looks like he’ll be back in Kansas City next season.

ESPN and NFL Network both reported Bieniemy’s contract expires after the Super Bowl, but he is expected to re-sign with the team. The Chiefs and Bieniemy had thought there was no need to address his expiring contract because the expectation was he would land a head-coaching job, but he was not hired by any of the seven teams that hired new head coaches. It is the second straight year Bieniemy was viewed as a top candidate and received multiple interviews but did not land a job.

The 51-year-old Bienemy has been with the Chiefs since 2013 and has been the offensive coordinator for the past three seasons. The offense has been one of the best in the NFL over that time with Mahomes emerging as a star under Bieniemy.

Bieniemy has become the face of the league’s problems with minority hiring, something he spoke about this past week.

“I did not ask be the poster boy of this particular situation that I have experienced,” Bieniemy said Tuesday. “At the end of the day, the only thing that you want to do is be recognized with all the things that you’ve accomplished, and for whatever reason that has not happened. That’s OK, because the only thing I know what to do is to just go back to work and continue chopping wood.”

Lori Locust completed her second NFL season as an assistant defensive line coach for the Buccaneers, one of two women on the Tampa staff. Maral Javadifar is the assistant strength and conditioning coach.

Locust previously was the assistant defensive line coach for the Birmingham Iron of the Alliance of American Football. In 2018, she was a defensive line coaching intern for the Ravens in training camp and from 2017-18 worked as a defensive line/linebackers coach and co-special teams coordinator of the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League.

“Coach Locust has been great to work with, now in my second year with her along my side,’’ defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said. “She’s very smart, very detail-oriented.” She makes note every single practice of how we’re working on our steps and being consistent, rather than being lackadaisical and look at the position we’re in right now.”",Patrick Mahomes likely needs toe surgery after Super Bowl 2021

Army Spc. Raul Hernandez Perez, 25, from Naples, Fla., was charged Thursday with the murder of his 25-year-old wife, Selena Roth, the Hawaii Star Advertiser reported.

Roth, who was an Army veteran, was found dead Jan. 13 at the Schofield Barracks.

Her family had requested a welfare check that led authorities to find her body in a trash can, Hawaii News Now reported.

“Our brigade and the Army community are heartbroken by Selena’s death,” said Col. Theodore Travis in a statement. “We have extended our condolences to Selena’s family, friends and loved ones.”

No further details have been released about the circumstances surrounding her death, but court records suggest that the couple’s relationship had been deteriorating.

Roth and Hernandez Perez had filed for divorce in October.

The following month, Hernandez Perez sought an order of protection against his wife, claiming that she “threw” electronics and let the air out of his car tires, the Star Advertiser reported.

Roth’s sister, Aubrey Rangel, wrote on a GoFundMe page that she is survived by a “beautiful young daughter who will never get the chance to know her mother.”

“She is leaving behind a father and a mother who adored her. No parent should have to bury their child,” the page said. “Selena is leaving behind many siblings [and] we are all grieving for the loss of our baby sister.”

Biden, in a clip from an interview with CBS News released Friday, said Trump should not be privy to US secrets “because of his erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection,” referring to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot​.

But White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Saturday: “The president was expressing his concern about former president Trump receiving access to sensitive intelligence, but he also has deep trust in his own intelligence team to make a determination about how to provide intelligence information if at any point the former president Trump requests a briefing​.”

​”​I just think that there is no need for him to have that intelligence briefing. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?” Biden said.

Super Bowl 2021 threw us an odd couple for the ages when they paired country star Eric Church, 43, with R&B diva Jazmine Sullivan, 33, to sing the national anthem.

Clearly, it was an attempt to unite the country — and fans of two very different musical genres — in some much-needed harmony after the political divisiveness that has been plaguing us as much as the pandemic.

But really, did Sullivan even need Church? The 12-time Grammy nominee practically blew away the “Springsteen” singer — from a proper social distance — once she opened her mouth.

The finest moment for Church, who also played the guitar, was opening “The Star-Spangled Banner” alone with his cool country twang — although he gets extra points for rocking that purple suede!

It was almost like pitting a lightweight against a heavyweight once Sullivan let her powerhouse pipes loose. She practically drowned him out when the two sang together — these were not two voices made to blend for a duet.

Makes you wonder why Sullivan, in her classic white suit and crystal headpiece, just didn’t get the chance to sing the national anthem all on her own. No doubt, she was the winner of this matchup.

And the national anthem duet failed to compete with H.E.R.’s version of “America the Beautiful” that preceded it. Beginning with a beautiful, stripped-down restraint that got to the soul of the song, the Grammy-winning R&B star then channeled Prince and launched into some guitar fireworks that lit up Raymond James Stadium before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs.

When all was said and done, H.E.R. was the star bursting in air on this occasion.

The Super Bowl 2021 anthem time of Sullivan and Church’s performance — a popular topic for online betters — came in at 2:24 by many counts.

Church and Sullivan’s duet joins the ranks of some of the best national anthem performances of all time — but of course couldn’t come close to patriotic pipes of Ms. Whitney Houston.

The “Star-Spangled Banner” wasn’t the only entertainment to rally up the crowds. Before the festivities officially began, Grammy-winning singer Alicia Keys, 40, sang a reflective tribute to black lives in a prerecorded segment. The song, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” is often referred to as the “Black National Anthem” and was written by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson.",Jazmine Sullivan and Eric Church crush 2021 national anthem with H.E.R.’s help

The winners of the 2021 Puppy Bowl have their coveted Lombarky Trophy: Team Ruff, the underdogs after consecutive victories from opponents Team Fluff, won the 17th annual matchup of adoptable pups and dogs.

Seventy pooches competed in this year’s “cutest game ever played,” reffed by longtime “rufferee” Dan Schachner.

Here’s a paw-by-paw recap of the riveting rumble.

Team Ruff’s Archer, an American Staffordshire Terrier, got the game off to a wild start with a penalty for “illegal use of the goal posts” — ripping off the goal post of the opposing team.

Ruff’s Muffin, a terrier mix, scored the team’s first touchdown after a fierce tackle from hearing-impaired terrier Marshall — who’s training to be a support pup for nurses on the front line of the COVID pandemic and was an early contender for Most Valuable Pup.

Meanwhile, Chow Chow mix Chunky Monkey was penalized for “excessive slumber” after his snooze on the sidelines. Cute, but no cigar. Still, Twitter went wild with the Most Valuable Mood served up by the Chunk himself.

Later in the first quarter, a brutal tug of war ensued between Muffin and Marshall while nervous Nelly Gus on team Fluff required a bit of a “pup” talk to get his head in the game. Alas, Marshall crossed the goal line for a Team Fluff’s first touchdown. Very Good Boy Milky Way also added to Fluff’s touchdown count in the first quarter. Paulie, a little rascal of a mix, barked right back, winning a touchdown for team Ruff. Teammate Mix Hashbrown tied up the game 21-21 at the end of the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Great Pyrenees mix Duke got duped by team Fluff’s unflappable offense, giving golden retriever Beliveau the opening for a touchdown, bringing his team up 35-21 after another TD from terrier-bulldog mix Sonic.

Ruff’s Fletcher, a hearing-impaired beagle mix, scored another jubilant touchdown, with Ruff’s first field goal scored by Tank, an adorable Rottweiler/boxer, at the end of the first half. Team Fluff remained the top dawgs, no thanks to Fluff’s Erica, a border collie mix who opted to take it easy in a nice quiet corner of the stadium.

The pups got a rest during the halftime show, performed by a very stimulated band of kittens, led by DJ Grand Master Scratch on the turntables.

At the start of the third quarter, Team Fluff’s furball of energy, Fozzie, was knocked with a penalty for “pancaking the puppy.” But the Norwegian Elkhound mix still looked fly — thanks to a special grooming at Harlem’s Doggie Day Spa prior to the big event. Later, Ruff’s Apollo gave Dwight a clear path to the end zone, handing Ruff a three-point lead. The victory didn’t last long, when Fluff’s Beliveau scored again after a rather aggressive tackle into the water bowl at Tank’s expense.

In the final quarter, crowd favorite Jett — a two-legged lab with his very own wheeled cart — made his doggie debut and scored a touchdown for Team Fluff, thanks to an assist from lab/terrier mix Jay.

American Staffordshire Terrier/Dutch Shepherd Paulie joined the two-touchdown club for team Ruff, but the team couldn’t keep up with the good boys. Beliveau — who frankly looked a bit large for a puppy — scored his fourth touchdown for Fluff.

Making the game a real paw-biter, Muffin scored another TD for Ruff, bringing the score up to 66-69 with less than a minute left in the game.

But Team Ruff scrapped his way to a victory for Team Ruff thanks to Big Boss Paulie from New York. After back-to-back wins from Team Fluff in years past, Team Ruff barked its way to legend-hood with a 73-69 final score.

Let’s not forget that the MVP of the game — Marshall, our hearing-impaired Boston terrier — snagged the esteemed title. Extra treats for Marshall!

The big matchup was joined by a lineup of celebrity animal lovers: It was hosted by best pals Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, who set the table tail-gate snacks and drinks — D-O-double-G, of course, brought the gin and juice.

First Lady Jill Biden was joined by her rescue German shepherds Champ and Major Biden, delivered a PSA on adopting dogs — and also wearing masks. Actress Kristen Bell joined the action, fostering rescue pup Java for a day.

But the real winners of the game were the 70 families who brought home champs after the Puppy Bowl — according to Animal Planet, every last one of the dogs in every Puppy Bowl get adopted by the time the show airs.",Puppy Bowl 2021 winner recap: Underdogs of Team Ruff were very good boys

It had planned to start vaccinating front-line health care workers next week but is putting that on hold after a small clinical trial found that it provided “minimal protection” against mild to moderate coronavirus infections from the new variant that is dominant in the country. The variant, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the country’s COVID-19 cases, appears to be more infectious and there is evidence to suggest it could be more virulent as well. Known as B.1.351, the variant has spread to at least 32 countries, including the United States.

Before the more contagious variant had spread widely in South Africa, the vaccine had shown to have an efficacy of around 75 percent. But a later analysis that took into account only infections by this new variant found that the vaccine only provided a 22 percent lower risk of developing mild to moderate COVID-19 compared to the placebo. That is well below the 50 percent that is widely seen as the threshold to consider a vaccine to be effective. The study mostly involved young adults so it didn’t analyze whether it helped to prevent severe cases of COVID-19.

South Africa has received one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Now the government says it will wait to figure out what the best course of action will be. Meanwhile, it will fast track the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that has shown to have more efficacy against the new variant, although at a lower rate than in the United States. Pfizer and Moderna have also said preliminary studies suggest their vaccines are less effective against B.1.351. The data have raised alarm bells around the world amid concerns that the new coronavirus variants that are emerging could make some of the vaccines less effective. Experts in South Africa said they have also found that people who had been infected with other versions of the coronavirus did not appear to have protection from being reinfected by the new variant.",South Africa Halts AstraZeneca Vaccine Rollout Over Effectiveness Doubts With New Variant

Now a new preprint study is making clear just how quickly it’s spreading as data shows that its prevalence among all COVID-19 cases doubles roughly every 10 days.

According to the calculations of the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, the U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7, could become the dominant strain in the United States by March. That estiamte confirms an earlier forecast by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was issued last month. “Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize covid-19 morbidity and mortality,” write the authors of the new study.

The study, which was posted on the preprint server MedRxiv, concludes that this new COVID-19 variant is around 35 to 45 percent more transmissible than the other strains currently present in the United States. That is in line with previous estimates although researchers said the number could be even higher. “It is here, it’s got its hooks deep into this country, and it’s on its way to very quickly becoming the dominant lineage,” Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and a co-author of the new paper, said.

The new variant is spreading particularly quickly in Florida, which has the highest number of cases involving B.1.1.7 followed by California. Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research Institute and a co-author of the new study, said that in just the past week the percentage of infections in Florida that involve the new variant may have increased from less than five percent to around 10 percent. Experts say this dynamic could be due to the way Florida hasn’t been strict about mask mandates and other restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The early data could amount to a warning sign for governments about the trouble ahead, particularly considering several countries have recently experienced surges in infections tied to this new variant. “There could indeed be a very serious situation developing in a matter of months or weeks,” Nicholas Davies, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the study, told the New York Times. “These may be early signals warranting urgent investigation by public health authorities.”",U.K. Coronavirus Variant Spreading Rapidly in U.S. as Cases Double Every 10 Days

The measure that seeks to reduce child poverty would provide a $3,600-per-child allowance for children under the age of six and $3,000 per child for those between the ages of six and 17.

The amount of money each family receives would start decreasing after an income threshold of $75,000 per year for single parents and $150,000 per couple. The benefit would be given out in monthly installments starting in July. The Washington Post was first to report the news after seeing a copy of the 22-page bill that is set to be unveiled on Monday.

The new legislation is being led by Rep. Richard Neal, the lawmaker from Massachusetts who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But it comes mere days after Sen. Mitt Romney surprised lawmakers by putting forward a similar proposal to boost cash transfers for people with children. “The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it’s devastating,” Neal said in a statement. “We are making the Child Tax Credit more generous, more accessible, and by paying it out monthly, this money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone’s head or food on their table.”

Although the proposal spearheaded by Neal would only make the benefit available for one year, Democrats say the goal would be to make it permanent further down the line as part of a broader effort to fight child poverty. The United States has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world, a phenomenon that has only worsened with the coronavirus pandemic. But it is still far from clear whether there would be enough Republican support to make that happen amid opposition from some in the GOP because the benefit would go to both working and nonworking Americans. “Of all the policy issues being discussed this Congress, of all the things we are working on, the biggest impact we can make for economic justice in our country — and enact measurable transformational change — lies within this policy that would slash child poverty,” said Sen. Cory Booker.","Democrats Want to Add $3,000 Cash Payments for Families With Children to COVID Relief"

The clear support for convicting Trump contrasts a bit with recent polls that have claimed Americans are more evenly split on the issue. A survey from the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released a few days ago found a lot more uncertainty among Americans. While 47 percent of Americans believed the Senate should convict Trump, 40 percent disagreed, and 12 percent said they weren’t sure. That poll was also largely split along party lines, with more than eight in 10 Democrats agreeing with conviction compared to only around one in 10 Republicans.

['Daniel Politi'],https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/sanders-slams-lower-income-cap-checks-coronavirus.html,[],The proposal to make fewer people eligible for the COVID-19 relief checks has received strong pushback from progressive Democrats.,[''],en,2021-02-07 16:30:58.094000+00:00,https://slate.com,,set(),"Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont harshly criticized Democrats who want to make fewer people eligible for the next COVID-19 stimulus checks. Sanders, who is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, characterized it as “unbelievable” that some Democrats “want to lower the income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals, and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples.”

Sanders wrote his tweet as Democrats are debating who should be eligible for the stimulus checks. Some Democrats say the income threshold should be lower for the checks, arguing that the latest round of stimulus should only go to the neediest families. That effort is led by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and it has received pushback from many Democrats, including Sanders, who tweeted Saturday that he found it hard to believe that some people who received checks under former President Donald Trump wouldn’t get them now that President Joe Biden is in office. “In other words, working class people who got checks from Trump would not get them from Biden,” Sanders tweeted. “Brilliant!”

Sanders reiterated his point with a subsequent tweet from another account. “In these difficult times, ALL working class people deserve the full $1,400,” Sanders tweeted. “Last I heard, someone making $55,000 a year is not ‘rich’.”

I strongly oppose lowering income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples.

Sanders immediately received support from several allies, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York lawmaker retweeted Sanders’ tweet and wrote that “It would be outrageous if we ran on giving more relief and ended up doing the opposite.” On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez wrote that it was “shockingly out of touch to assert that $50k is ‘too wealthy’ to receive relief.”

In conclusion, $50k is wack and we shouldn’t do wack things. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 7, 2021

Sanders’ tweet came shortly after Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chairs the Progressive Caucus, also tweeted her opposition to lowering the threshold. “We promised people that if we won the Senate, we would send out $2,000 survival checks. They delivered us to victory—and now we MUST deliver,” Jayapal wrote.

Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Sanders said he supports a “strong cliff” for the payments “so it doesn’t kind of spill over to people making $300,000 a year.” Right now the plan calls for the amount of money a person receives to start decreasing when they pass the threshold. “To say to a worker in Vermont or California or any place else, that if you’re making, you know, $52,000 a year, you are too rich to get this help, the full benefit, I think that that’s absurd,” Sanders said.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also expressed a similar sentiment on Sunday. “If you think about an elementary school teacher or policeman making $60,000 a year, and faced with children who are out of school, and people who may have had to withdraw from the labor force in order to take care of them,” Yellen said, “I would certainly agree, that it’s appropriate for people there to get support.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says details on the cutoff for targeted direct stimulus payments ""are to be determined, but struggling middle class families need help, too.""

The Wyoming Republican Party voted Saturday to censure Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, and called for her to resign “immediately.” And there didn’t seem to be much disagreement. After only 11 minutes of debate there was a voice vote and only around eight members of the 74-member committee opposed the censure that never moved on to a formal vote.

We have great challenges ahead of us as we move forward and combat the disastrous policies of the Biden Administration.”

The censure vote came mere days after Cheney survived an effort by Trump loyalists to kick her out from her House leadership position. House Republicans voted 145-61 to keep Cheney as conference committee chair. Before the state party voted, at least a dozen Republican committees at the county level had passed their own censure resolutions against Cheney, who already faces at least two primary challengers in 2022 only months after winning a third term with almost 70 percent of the vote. Late last month, some 1,000 people attended a rally led by Rep. Matt Gaetz against Cheney in front of the Wyoming Capitol.

Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeachment and several others have also suffered similar blowback from members of their own party. “Each and every one of those 10, when they made that vote, they knew in their heads and in their hearts it was probably a political death sentence. They knew that,” said former Rep. Joe Walsh, who tried to mount a primary challenge to Trump in 2020. The South Carolina Republican Party censured Rep. Tom Rice over his support for impeachment.
